# REFLECTION

IV.1
jati-antara-parinama prakrti-apurat

The fundamental principle presented now:

Being is entirely a self-enclosed singularity of
immediately living being that can never get outside itself.

    This principle contains and completes
    what one could present as the first part
    of the science of knowing:
    the pure theory of truth or reason.
    We proceed now to the second part;
    in order to deduce from the first part,
    as necessary and true appearances,
    everything which up to now we have
    let go as merely empirical
    and not intrinsically valid.

citer apratisamkramayas tad-akara-apattau svabuddhi-samvedanam

Whether one names the absolute “being” or “light,”
it has already been completely familiar for several weeks.
Since attaining this familiarity, we are working on
deriving not, as is obvious, the thing itself,
but rather its appearance.
The request for this derivation can mean nothing else than
that something still undiscovered remains in the absolute itself,
through which it coheres with its appearance.

We know from the foregoing
(which, to be sure has been discovered only factically,
but which nonetheless would have its application
in a purely genetic derivation)
that the principle of appearance is
a principle of disjunction
within the aforementioned undivided oneness
and at the same time, obviously, within appearance.
However, as regards the absolute disjunction,
I urge you to recall an analysis conducted right at
the beginning of this lecture series,
in which the following became evident.
If disjunction were to be found
directly within absolute oneness,
as is unavoidably required by
the final form of the science of knowing,
and is what we intend here,
it must not be grasped as a simple disjunction,
but rather as the disjunction of
two different disjunctive foundations.
[It must be] not just a division,
but rather the self-intersecting division
of a presupposed division that again presupposes itself.
Or, using the expression with which we have designated it
in our most recent mention of it,
[it is] no simple “from,”
but rather a “from” in a “from,”
or a “from” of a “from.”
The most difficult part of the philosophical art is
avoiding confusion about this intersection,
and distinguishing that which is endlessly similar
and is distinguishable only through the subtlest mental distinguishing.
I remind you of this so that you will not become mistrustful
if, in what follows, we enter regions
in which you no longer understand the method
and [in which] it should even seem miraculous.
Afterwards we will give an account of it;
but beforehand we actually cannot.

IV.22
drastr-drsya-uparaktam cittam sarva-artham

This much as a general introduction for the week:
Now back to the point at which we stood at the end of the last hour.
Absolute self–genesis posited and given a principle,
obviously within knowing,
which is thus a “principle-providing” [occurrence].
Thus within this knowing there follows
the absolute, positive negation of genesis =
completed and enduring being;
and indeed, because this entire investigation
concerns light’s pure immanence,
our investigation has long ago brought in
a presumed being external to knowing,
knowing’s [own] completed and enduring being.

Now We saw into this connection during the last hour
and see into it again here;
as is evident, we see one of the two terms
in and through the insight into this connection,
determined as such.
Thus, this latter is itself mediated,
and just we (= the insight we have now achieved) are
therefore the unconditionally immediate [term].

Two remarks about this.
1. I have just recalled again,
that here the inner being and persevering is knowing’s being,
the very thing already recognized as absolute genesis
and [the thing] we have also already validated in the last hour
as a priori rational knowledge of an absolute principle.
At this point, we must hold on to
the fact that it is knowing’s being,
even in case we should let go of
the addition as a shortcut in speaking;
because otherwise we will fall back into
where we were before, far removed from further progress.
Therefore, our entire chain of reasoning
must always be present to us, now more than ever.

2. It is said that every philosophical system
remains stuck somewhere in dead being and enduring.
If now a system derived this being itself in its inner essence,
as ours has done, by positing a higher principle for absolute genesis,
whereby it then necessarily becomes the positive negation of genesis,
and therefore [becomes] being;
if too this being is not the being of an object and so doubly dead,
but rather the being of knowing, and so of inner life;
then such a system seems to have already
accomplished something unheard-of.
However, we are required to see clearly here that
by this we have not yet achieved anything,
since even this saturated being of living is
again something mediate and is derived from that
which alone now remains for us,
the insight into the connection.

Now let us apply this directly for our true purpose,
which we have long recognized.
Knowing’s derived being will now yield
ordinary, non-transcendental, knowing.
Through our present insight into
the genesis of the former’s principle
(that is, the principle of the recently derived knowing),
and through reflecting on this insight
we elevate ourselves to genuine transcendental knowing
or the science of knowing;
and [we have done so] not merely factically,
with our factical selves,
so that we are the factical root.
We have already been this since
the time when we dissolved into pure light;
instead [we have done so] objectively and intelligibly,
so that we, achieving insight factically,
at the same time penetrate the law of this insight.
Henceforth we have to work in the higher region
that has now been opened.
Only here will the principle of
appearance and disjunction
that we seek show itself to us;
which then should only be applied
to existing (= ordinary) actual knowing.
