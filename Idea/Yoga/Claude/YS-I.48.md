# Analysis of Yoga Sutra I.48: rtambhara tatra prajna

## I. Textual Foundation

### A. Sanskrit Analysis

1. Original Text:
   ```sanskrit
   ऋतम्भरा तत्र प्रज्ञा
   ṛtambharā tatra prajñā
   ```

2. Word Analysis:
   - rtam (ऋतम्): truth, cosmic order, fundamental reality
   - bhara (भरा): bearing, carrying, supporting
   - tatra (तत्र): there, in that state
   - prajna (प्रज्ञा): wisdom, insight, understanding

3. Traditional Interpretations:
   - Vyasa emphasizes this as direct truth-bearing wisdom
   - Transition from mediated to immediate knowledge
   - Wisdom that carries/supports fundamental reality
   - Resolution of subject-object duality

### B. Technical Terms

1. Core Concepts:
   - Rtam: Cosmic truth/order beyond conventional truth (satya)
   - Prajna: Direct non-dual wisdom
   - Rtambhara: Truth-bearing capacity
   - Technical relation to nirvicara vaisaradya

2. Systematic Context:
   - Follows from I.47's adhyatma-prasada
   - Prepares for I.49's special status
   - Bridge between prasada and direct knowledge

## II. Genetic Development

### A. Principle Structure

1. Original Unity:
   - Pure truth (rtam) as ground
   - Self-illuminating wisdom
   - Non-dual structure of knowing

2. Genetic Movement:
   - From prasada to rtambhara
   - Through truth-bearing capacity
   - To direct wisdom

### B. Logical Structure

1. Dialectical Moments:
   - Universal: Pure truth (rtam)
   - Particular: Truth-bearing capacity
   - Singular: Direct wisdom (prajna)

2. Development Pattern:
   - Initial Position: State of prasada
   - Necessary Transition: Truth-bearing emergence
   - Resulting Unity: Direct wisdom

## III. Integration Analysis

### A. Samapatti Elements

1. Being Structure:
   - Truth as self-illuminating reality
   - Non-dual nature of wisdom
   - Unity of knower and known

2. Knowledge Relation:
   - Beyond subject-object duality
   - Direct truth-bearing
   - Integration of being and knowing

### B. Logical Correspondence

1. Connection to Science of Logic:
   - Corresponds to absolute knowing
   - Parallels unity of concept and reality
   - Reflects self-determining truth

2. Systematic Position:
   - Culmination of prasada
   - Preparation for final transcendence
   - Bridge to absolute knowing
