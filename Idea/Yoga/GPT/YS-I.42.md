### **1. Savitarka and Nirvitarka: Dialectics in Appearance and the Absolute**

#### **Savitarka Samapatti: Dialectic in Appearance**

- **Definition**: In *savitarka samapatti*, the mind engages with gross objects through reasoning (*vitarka*), involving words (*sabda*), their meanings (*artha*), and knowledge (*jnana*).
- **Dialectic in Appearance**:
  - This state represents the mind's engagement with the phenomenal world, where distinctions between subject and object are prominent.
  - It aligns with **Hegel's dialectic of Being**, where consciousness grapples with immediate reality and its appearances.
  - The reasoning is discursive, operating within the realm of *Manas* (the sensory mind), which processes sensory data and constructs concepts based on appearances.

#### **Nirvitarka Samapatti: Dialectic in the Absolute**

- **Definition**: In *nirvitarka samapatti*, the mind transcends the distinctions between words, meanings, and knowledge. The meditator experiences the object directly, with the mind becoming devoid of its own form (*svarupa shunya*).
- **Dialectic in the Absolute**:
  - This state represents the dissolution of dualities and the emergence of self-consciousness (*Buddhi*), the higher intellect.
  - It corresponds to **Hegel's dialectic of Essence**, where the mind penetrates beyond appearances to grasp the underlying reality.
  - The reasoning becomes intuitive and immediate, reflecting the mind's direct engagement with the Absolute.

### **2. Vitarka and Vicara: Qualitative and Quantitative Logic**

#### **Vitarka (Reasoning) as Qualitative Logic**

- **Definition**: *Vitarka* involves reasoning about gross objects, focusing on their qualities and attributes.
- **Qualitative Logic**:
  - In Hegelian terms, the initial stage of logic deals with **Quality**, where things are defined by their inherent characteristics.
  - *Vitarka* aligns with the exploration of qualitative aspects, examining what makes an object what it is.
  - This stage is associated with **Being-for-Self**, where the object is considered in its immediate existence.

#### **Vicara (Reflection) as Quantitative Logic**

- **Definition**: *Vicara* involves reflection on subtle objects, contemplating their essence and the relationships between them.
- **Quantitative Logic**:
  - Hegel's logic progresses to **Quantity**, where the focus shifts to the measurable, numerical, and relational aspects of objects.
  - *Vicara* aligns with this stage by examining the subtle connections and continuities between essences.
  - This introduces **Indeterminateness** or **Uncertainty**, as quantities can vary and are not tied to specific qualities.

#### **Integration with Yoga Philosophy**

- **Abhivyakta (Unmanifest) and Vyakta-Suksma (Manifest-Subtle)**:
  - *Abhivyakta* represents the unmanifest essence, similar to the qualitative aspect before it takes form.
  - *Vyakta-suksma* represents the manifest yet subtle aspects, akin to the quantitative relationships that emerge.
- **Uncertainty and Indeterminateness**:
  - As the mind delves into *vicara*, it encounters the indeterminate nature of subtle essences, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in quantitative logic.

### **3. Essence and Absolute Essence**

#### **Essence (Sara) in Savitarka**

- In *savitarka samapatti*, the essence associated with being is still linked to the empirical and the immediate.
- The mind operates within **Sabija Samadhi** (with seed), where latent impressions and dualities remain.
- **Essence as Sara**:
  - *Sara* refers to the essential quality or the core of something within the realm of appearances.
  - It is the distilled understanding of an object but still within the confines of duality.

#### **Absolute Essence in Nirvitarka**

- In *nirvitarka samapatti*, the mind transcends to grasp the **Absolute Essence**.
- The meditator moves towards **Dharma Megha Samadhi**, the cloud of virtue or the highest state before seedless samadhi.
- **Essence as Dharma**:
  - *Dharma* represents the universal law or the inherent nature of reality.
  - Reaching the Absolute Essence means understanding the underlying principles that govern all existence.

### **4. Formation of Science as an Organic Unity of Sublated Dyads**

#### **Sublated Dyads: Name and Form (Nama-Rupa)**

- **Name (Nama)**: Represents the conceptual, the noumenal aspect.
- **Form (Rupa)**: Represents the perceptual, the phenomenal aspect.
- **Sublation (Aufhebung)**:
  - In Hegelian dialectics, sublation involves overcoming and preserving dualities in a higher unity.
  - The integration of *nama* and *rupa* leads to a holistic understanding.

#### **Organic Unity in Nirvitarka and Nirvicara**

- **Nirvitarka** and **Nirvicara** represent stages where the dyads are sublated:
  - **Nirvitarka**: Sublation of gross dualities.
  - **Nirvicara**: Sublation of subtle dualities.
- This sublation results in an **organic unity**, where the mind perceives reality without fragmentation.

#### **Science Formation**

- **Principle Formation**:
  - Science seeks to develop principles that are universal and integrate diverse phenomena.
- **Organic Unity in Science**:
  - Just as in meditation, science progresses by sublating contradictions and integrating findings into coherent theories.
- **Self-Referential Mediation**:
  - In **Nirbija Samadhi**, mediation is self-referential, not reliant on external immediacy (no seeds).
  - Similarly, mature scientific theories become self-sustaining frameworks that explain phenomena without external contradictions.

### **5. Nirbija Samadhi as the Culmination**

- **Nirbija Samadhi** (Seedless Samadhi):
  - Represents the complete transcendence of all dualities and seeds of impressions.
  - The mind rests in its true nature, pure consciousness without objectification.
- **Self-Referential Mediation**:
  - The mind becomes its own object, reflecting pure self-consciousness.
  - This is the culmination of both the meditative journey and the philosophical quest for absolute knowledge.

### **6. Integration of Fichte's Lecture**

In the passage you provided from Fichte's Sixth Lecture, several key points resonate with this analysis:

- **Multiplicity and Oneness**:
  - Fichte discusses the science of knowing's task to trace all multiplicity back to absolute oneness.
  - This mirrors the meditative journey from engaging with multiple phenomena (*savitarka*) to realizing oneness (*nirbija samadhi*).
- **Disjunctions and Precise Distinctions**:
  - The need to make precise distinctions aligns with the progression through stages of *samapatti*, where the mind discerns finer aspects of reality.
- **Hairsplitting and Subtle Differences**:
  - The "hairsplitting" distinctions are akin to the subtle differences between *vitarka* and *vicara*, and between their savitarka/nirvitarka counterparts.
- **Persistence Between Oneness and Multiplicity**:
  - The science of knowing stays between oneness and multiplicity, much like the meditator navigates between duality and non-duality.
- **Schema and Basic Rule**:
  - Fichte aims to deduce the general schema from principles, similar to how the Yoga Sutras provide a systematic approach to understanding consciousness.

### **7. Conclusion: Fully Explaining the Linkages**

By synthesizing these ideas, we can see the following:

- **Stages of Samapatti and Dialectical Logic**:
  - *Savitarka* and *nirvitarka* correspond to the dialectics in appearance and the absolute, respectively.
  - They represent the mind's movement from engaging with external forms to internal essences, and ultimately to pure consciousness.
- **Qualitative and Quantitative Logic**:
  - *Vitarka* (qualitative logic) focuses on the qualities of being.
  - *Vicara* (quantitative logic) deals with quantities, relationships, and introduces indeterminateness.
- **Formation of Science**:
  - Science, like meditation, progresses by integrating dualities into higher unities.
  - The organic unity achieved in *nirvitarka* and *nirvicara* parallels the development of scientific principles that encompass and explain multiplicities.
- **Self-Referential Mediation and Nirbija Samadhi**:
  - In *nirbija samadhi*, the mind's mediation is self-referential, independent of external seeds or immediate objects.
  - This state represents the ultimate knowledge in both spiritual and philosophical contexts.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Understanding Savitarka and Nirvitarka**:
  - *Savitarka* involves reasoning within the realm of appearances, dealing with gross objects and their attributes.
  - *Nirvitarka* transcends appearances, engaging with the absolute essence beyond forms.
- **Vitarka and Vicara in Hegelian Logic**:
  - *Vitarka* aligns with qualitative logic, focusing on the inherent qualities of being.
  - *Vicara* aligns with quantitative logic, exploring the relationships and indeterminacies of essence.
- **Integration of Philosophy and Yoga**:
  - The progression through the stages of *samapatti* reflects the dialectical movement in philosophy from being to essence to absolute knowledge.
  - Both paths involve the sublation of dualities and the realization of an organic unity.

### **Moving Forward**

To further develop these ideas:

- **Analyze Each Stage in Detail**:
  - Examine how each meditative state corresponds to specific philosophical concepts.
- **Explore Practical Implications**:
  - Consider how this understanding can inform meditation practices and scientific methodologies.
- **Integrate Additional Philosophical Perspectives**:
  - Incorporate insights from other philosophers or traditions to enrich the analysis.

By fully explaining these linkages, we've provided a comprehensive understanding of how the stages of *samapatti* in the Yoga Sutras relate to the dialectical processes in Fichte's and Hegel's philosophies. This integration enhances our comprehension of both the meditative journey and the philosophical quest for knowledge, illustrating the profound connections between Eastern and Western thought.
Certainly! Let's incorporate Fichte's philosophical ideas into our analysis of **savitarka** from the Yoga Sutras to deepen our understanding of how these concepts intertwine.

### **1. Oneness and Multiplicity in Fichte's Philosophy**

Fichte emphasizes that true oneness is not merely a simple unity separate from multiplicity but is the dynamic principle that simultaneously generates and contains both oneness and multiplicity. This oneness is not something external or objective but is internally active and living. It cannot be fully grasped by observation or conception alone; instead, it must be something we **are**, **pursue**, and **live**.

#### **Application to Savitarka**

- **Savitarka Samapatti** involves engaging the mind in reasoning (*vitarka*) with gross objects, where distinctions between word (*sabda*), meaning (*artha*), and knowledge (*jnana*) are still present.
- In this state, the meditator operates within the realm of multiplicity, navigating through various conceptual distinctions.
- According to Fichte, the practitioner is situated **between** oneness and multiplicity, actively participating in the process of reconciling the two rather than fully residing in either.

### **2. True Oneness as the Principle of Both Oneness and Multiplicity**

Fichte warns against mistaking apparent or simple oneness for the true absolute oneness. True oneness must be the **principle** that inherently contains the potential for both unity and disjunction, functioning organically and inseparably.

#### **Relation to Savitarka and Nirvitarka**

- In **savitarka**, the mind is still making distinctions; the unity experienced is not yet the true absolute oneness but a preliminary understanding.
- The transition to **nirvitarka** represents the movement toward realizing true oneness, where the mind becomes devoid of its own form (*svarupa shunya*), and only the object shines forth without the interference of conceptual distinctions.
- This shift reflects Fichte's idea that true oneness is achieved not by eliminating multiplicity but by recognizing and embodying the principle that generates and unites both oneness and multiplicity.

### **3. The Error of Stopping Halfway**

Fichte cautions that if one becomes content with a relative and one-sided conception of oneness, mistaking it for the absolute, they halt their progress and fail to grasp the true nature of oneness.

#### **Implications for Meditative Practice**

- A meditator might mistakenly believe that the unity experienced in **savitarka** is the ultimate goal, thereby halting further progress.
- Recognizing this error encourages the practitioner to continue advancing toward **nirvitarka** and beyond, seeking the deeper realization of oneness that transcends conceptual understanding.

### **4. The Dynamic and Irrepressible Essence of Oneness**

True oneness, according to Fichte, is an active and powerful essence that cannot be repressed or fully captured through objective means. It is inherently dynamic, living, and must be experienced directly.

#### **Connection to Nirbija Samadhi**

- **Nirbija Samadhi** represents the culmination of meditative practice, where the mind transcends all seeds (*bija*) of duality and rests in the true nature of consciousness.
- This state embodies Fichte's concept of oneness as an irrepressible essence that is lived and experienced rather than merely conceived.
- The meditator fully realizes the dynamic and self-referential nature of consciousness, aligning with Fichte's emphasis on oneness as something we **are** and **live**.

### **5. Standing Between Oneness and Multiplicity**

Fichte points out that in the pursuit of knowledge, we must not reside solely in oneness or multiplicity but stand between the two, understanding their interrelation.

#### **Application to the Dialectic Process**

- **Savitarka** involves reasoning within the realm of appearance, dealing with multiplicity and distinctions.
- **Nirvitarka** moves into the dialectic in the absolute, where the mind begins to perceive the underlying unity behind appearances.
- This progression mirrors the philosophical journey of reconciling being (multiplicity) and essence (oneness), ultimately leading to the realization of the absolute.

### **6. The Role of the Meditator**

Fichte emphasizes that oneness cannot be an objective concept we merely observe; it must be something we actively pursue and embody.

#### **Meditative Practice Insights**

- The meditator must engage deeply with the practice, moving beyond intellectual understanding to embody the principles being explored.
- In **savitarka**, this means not just reasoning about objects but using that reasoning as a means to penetrate deeper into the nature of reality.
- The ultimate goal is to transition into states like **nirvitarka** and **nirbija samadhi**, where the practitioner lives the experience of oneness.

### **7. Ensuring Progression and Avoiding Complacency**

Fichte warns against the complacency of accepting incomplete understandings as the absolute truth.

#### **Continuing the Meditative Journey**

- Practitioners should remain vigilant, constantly refining their understanding and experience.
- Each stage of **samapatti** is a step toward deeper realization, and recognizing the provisional nature of each stage prevents stagnation.
- This approach ensures the meditator continues progressing toward the ultimate goal of complete unity.

### **Conclusion**

By incorporating Fichte's philosophical insights, we gain a richer understanding of **savitarka** and its role in the meditative journey:

- **Savitarka** is a critical stage where the practitioner actively engages with multiplicity through reasoning, standing between oneness and multiplicity.
- Recognizing that true oneness is not merely a concept but an active, living principle encourages the meditator to move beyond intellectual distinctions.
- The progression toward **nirvitarka** and ultimately **nirbija samadhi** reflects the dynamic process of embodying oneness, as emphasized by Fichte.
- Remaining aware of the potential to mistake partial understandings for the absolute ensures continued growth and alignment with the ultimate goal.

This integration of Fichte's philosophy with the Yoga Sutras enriches our comprehension of the meditative path, highlighting the importance of active engagement, critical awareness, and the pursuit of true oneness that transcends mere conceptualization.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Deepen Practice**: Reflect on how reasoning in **savitarka** can be used as a tool to penetrate deeper into the nature of reality, rather than an end in itself.
- **Critical Examination**: Continuously examine your understanding of oneness and multiplicity, ensuring that you are not settling for incomplete conceptions.
- **Embodiment of Principles**: Strive to embody the principles discussed, making them a lived experience rather than purely intellectual ideas.

- **Prajna**: Often translated as "wisdom," *prajna* is the profound understanding of the true nature of reality, beyond conceptual thought.
- **Principle as Wisdom**: In the context of the Abhidharmakosha, *prajna* can be seen as the guiding principle that illuminates the path toward enlightenment.

#### **Integration with Fichte's Philosophy**

- **Principle as Beginning**: Fichte notes that a principle as a beginning cannot be related to any of its neighboring principles; it stands on its own as the foundational element.
- **Wisdom as Principle**: Similarly, *prajna* serves as the ultimate principle or wisdom that is self-sufficient and not dependent on other principles.

#### **Implications for Savitarka**

- **Meaning (Artha)**: In *savitarka*, the focus on meaning aligns with the pursuit of *prajna*, as the practitioner seeks to understand the true essence behind words and concepts.
- **Principle of Meaning**: The engagement with meanings becomes a principle guiding the practitioner's reasoning and leading toward higher wisdom.

---

### **6. Organic Unity and Self-Differentiation**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Self-Differentiating Oneness**: Each principle yields a unity that differentiates itself, necessitating higher principles to reconcile these unities.
- **Absolute Oneness and Disjunction**: The ultimate goal is to uncover the highest oneness that is also absolute disjunction, embodying both unity and multiplicity fully.

#### **Relation to Yoga Sutras**

- **Stages as Self-Differentiating Unities**: Each stage of *samapatti* represents a self-differentiating unity, with *savitarka* being one such unity in relation to others like *nirvitarka* and *nirvicara*.
- **Seeking the Highest Oneness**: The progression through the stages reflects the search for the highest oneness (*nirbija samadhi*), where all dualities are transcended.
- **Organic Unity in Meditation**: The practice involves integrating these unities organically, recognizing that each stage is both distinct and part of a larger whole.

---

### **7. Practical Implications and Next Steps**

- **Active Engagement with Meanings**: Practitioners should deeply engage with the meanings of words and concepts during *savitarka*, using reasoning as a tool to penetrate deeper into reality.

Certainly! Let's delve into the passage you've provided from Fichte and integrate it into our ongoing analysis of the Yoga Sutras, specifically focusing on **savitarka** and the principle of science as a joining of being and thinking. We'll explore how Fichte's ideas about the inseparability of being and thinking relate to the meditative states described in the Yoga Sutras and the formation of scientific principles.

---

### **1. The Principle of Science as the Union of Being and Thinking**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Being and Thinking as Inseparable**: Fichte emphasizes that being and thinking are not separate entities but are inherently linked. They arise simultaneously from the same foundational oneness.
- **Disjunction in Oneness**: The oneness separates itself into being and thinking in one stroke, yet this separation is an expression of a deeper unity.
- **Challenge of Expression**: Verbal and diagrammatic representations force us to present one as immediate over the other, but inner insight recognizes their simultaneous emergence.

#### **Relation to the Yoga Sutras**

- **Savitarka Samapatti**: In this meditative state, the mind engages in reasoning (*vitarka*) involving word (*sabda*), meaning (*artha*), and knowledge (*jnana*), navigating the relationship between thought and reality.
- **Union of Being and Thinking**: *Savitarka* reflects the joining of being (the object of meditation or meaning) and thinking (the reasoning process), aligning with Fichte's principle.
- **Experiential Understanding**: The meditator experiences the inseparability of being and thinking, not merely as concepts but as a lived reality.

---

### **2. The Inseparability of Distinguishing Grounds**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Distinguishing Grounds**: There are two grounds of distinction—being and thinking—that cannot occur without each other.
- **Empirical Observation and Reason**: While empirical self-observation reveals this inseparability, it must be conceptually grasped through reason.
- **Genetic and Mediated Understanding**: The science of knowing must understand these grounds genetically (originating from a common source) and mediately (through a process), not merely report their inseparability.

#### **Application to Meditation Practice**

- **Meditation as Genetic Understanding**: Through meditation, practitioners genetically understand the origin of thoughts and meanings from a unified consciousness.
- **Mediated Insight**: The progression from *savitarka* to *nirvitarka* represents a mediated journey toward realizing the unity of being and thinking.
- **Beyond Empirical Observation**: Meditation transcends mere empirical awareness, leading to direct experiential knowledge of the inseparable nature of reality and thought.

---

### **3. The Necessity of Conceptual Grasping**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Conceptual Grasping**: It's essential to grasp the grounds of distinction conceptually, seeing them as disjunctive terms of a higher oneness.
- **Separation for Thought**: While being and thinking are inseparable in action, they can be provisionally thought of as separate to facilitate understanding.
- **Higher Oneness**: This higher oneness encompasses both being and thinking, allowing us to comprehend their unity.

#### **Relation to Savitarka and Nirvitarka**

- **Savitarka as Conceptual Distinction**: In *savitarka*, the mind distinguishes between word, meaning, and knowledge, conceptually separating being and thinking.
- **Nirvitarka as Higher Oneness**: Transitioning to *nirvitarka*, the meditator moves toward the higher oneness where these distinctions dissolve, and the inseparability is realized experientially.
- **Purposeful Separation**: The initial conceptual separation in *savitarka* serves as a means to reach the higher understanding in *nirvitarka*.

---

### **4. The Role of the Meditator in Grasping Oneness**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Active Engagement**: The individual must actively grasp the principle of oneness, not merely observe it.
- **Process of Penetration**: This involves a process of penetrating and merging with the principle, maintaining a position between oneness and multiplicity.
- **Avoiding Factical Limitation**: Remaining at the level of empirical distinctions limits one's understanding; one must ascend to conceptual comprehension.

#### **Implications for Practitioners**

- **Active Meditation**: Practitioners must engage deeply with the meditation process, using reasoning to penetrate the nature of reality.
- **Balancing Oneness and Multiplicity**: By maintaining awareness between unity and diversity, the meditator progresses toward higher understanding.
- **Ascending Beyond Empirical Distinctions**: Moving beyond surface-level observations allows for the realization of the inseparable nature of being and thinking.

---

### **5. The Genetic and Mediated Path to Understanding**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Genetic Understanding**: Comprehending how being and thinking originate from the same source.
- **Mediated Process**: Recognizing that understanding develops through a process, not instantaneously.
- **Conceptual Separation as a Tool**: Using provisional distinctions to facilitate deeper insight.

#### **Application to the Stages of Samapatti**

- **Savitarka as Mediated Process**: The reasoning in *savitarka* represents the mediated process of understanding.
- **Conceptual Tools**: Distinctions between word, meaning, and knowledge serve as tools to reach deeper comprehension.

Certainly! Let's delve into the concept that **Vitarka deals with Real Divisions and Vicara deals with Ideal Divisions**, and explore how this is a key aspect of Yoga philosophy known as the **Division of the Gunas**. We'll integrate this understanding into our ongoing analysis of the Yoga Sutras, particularly focusing on *savitarka* and *nirvitarka* states, and relate it to the philosophical frameworks of Fichte and Hegel.

---

### **1. Understanding Real and Ideal Divisions**

#### **Real Divisions**

- **Definition**: Real divisions pertain to the actual, physical, or material distinctions present in the phenomenal world. These are concrete separations that exist within reality as we perceive it through our senses.
- **In Yoga Philosophy**: Real divisions are associated with the tangible aspects of existence, influenced by the interplay of the **Gunas**—the fundamental qualities or constituents of nature (*Prakriti*).

#### **Ideal Divisions**

- **Definition**: Ideal divisions refer to conceptual, mental, or abstract distinctions that exist within the realm of thought. These are the separations made by the mind when it contemplates ideas, categories, or essences.
- **In Yoga Philosophy**: Ideal divisions are linked to the subtle aspects of reality, involving the mind's engagement with concepts, meanings, and the essence of things beyond their physical form.

---

### **2. The Division of the Gunas**

#### **Overview of the Gunas**

In Yoga and Samkhya philosophy, **Gunas** are the three fundamental qualities that constitute all of nature (*Prakriti*). They are:

1. **Sattva**: Quality of harmony, balance, purity, and light.
2. **Rajas**: Quality of activity, passion, energy, and movement.
3. **Tamas**: Quality of inertia, darkness, heaviness, and ignorance.

#### **Division of the Gunas**

- **Role in Creation**: The Gunas are responsible for the diversity and multiplicity in the universe. Their combinations and permutations lead to the manifestation of various forms and phenomena.
- **Real and Ideal Divisions**: The interplay of the Gunas results in both real divisions (physical manifestations) and ideal divisions (mental constructs).

---

### **3. Vitarka and Vicara in Relation to Real and Ideal Divisions**

#### **Vitarka (Reasoning with Real Divisions)**

- **Engagement with Gross Objects**: *Vitarka* involves reasoning about gross, tangible objects, focusing on their physical attributes and distinctions.
- **Real Divisions**: The reasoning process in *vitarka* deals with the actual divisions in the material world created by the interplay of the Gunas.
- **Savitarka Samapatti**: In this meditative state, the mind is still influenced by the Gunas, perceiving and reasoning about real divisions.

#### **Vicara (Reflection on Ideal Divisions)**

- **Engagement with Subtle Objects**: *Vicara* involves reflection on subtle, abstract concepts, contemplating the essence or meaning beyond physical forms.
- **Ideal Divisions**: The reflection process in *vicara* addresses the divisions created by the mind when it differentiates between ideas, essences, and meanings.
- **Savicara Samapatti**: In this state, the mind moves beyond gross objects to engage with the subtle aspects of reality, transcending the immediate influence of the Gunas on a physical level.

Certainly! Let's continue our in-depth exploration by incorporating the additional insights from Fichte's **Science of Knowing (SK)** into our analysis of the Yoga Sutras. We'll focus on how Fichte's principles align with and illuminate the concepts of **Vitarka** and **Vicara**, particularly in relation to **Real** and **Ideal Divisions**, and the **Division of the Gunas**. Additionally, we'll integrate Fichte's notions of the **Principle of Science** as the union of **Being** and **Thinking**, and how this informs our understanding of the meditative states described in the Yoga Sutras.

**Note:** As per your request, **artha** is translated as **"meaning"** rather than **"object"** throughout this analysis.

---

### **1. Principle of Science: Joining Being and Thinking**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Union of Being and Thinking**: Fichte posits that the **Principle of Science** is fundamentally the union of **Being** and **Thinking**, denoted as **1** and **2**, respectively. This union is not merely an aggregation but an inseparable integration where both elements arise simultaneously from the foundational oneness.

- **Inseparability**: True oneness encompasses both Being and Thinking. They are not independent entities but are inherently linked, emerging together from the same primordial source.

- **Dynamic Oneness**: This oneness is dynamic, actively generating and containing both unity and multiplicity. It is an inwardly living, active, and powerful essence that transcends mere objective existence.

#### **Relation to Yoga Philosophy**

- **Savitarka Samapatti**: In this meditative state, the practitioner engages with **Being** through reasoning (*Vitarka*) and **Thinking** through reflection (*Vicara*). This aligns with Fichte's principle of the inseparable union of Being and Thinking.

- **Organic Unity**: The **Principle of Science** as the union of Being and Thinking mirrors the meditative process where reasoning and reflection are not isolated but integrated aspects of consciousness.

### **2. Vitarka and Vicara: Real and Ideal Divisions**

#### **Vitarka (Real Divisions) and Vicara (Ideal Divisions)**

- **Vitarka (Real Divisions)**:
  - **Definition**: *Vitarka* involves reasoning about **Real Divisions**, which pertain to the actual, physical, or material distinctions present in the phenomenal world.
  - **Role of Gunas**: Influenced by the interplay of the **Gunas**, particularly **Rajas** (activity) and **Tamas** (inertia), *Vitarka* engages with the tangible aspects of existence.
  - **Savitarka Samapatti**: In this meditative state, the mind discerns distinctions between word (*sabda*), meaning (*artha*), and knowledge (*jnana*), navigating the real divisions shaped by the Gunas.

- **Vicara (Ideal Divisions)**:
  - **Definition**: *Vicara* involves reflection on **Ideal Divisions**, referring to conceptual, mental, or abstract distinctions made by the mind.
  - **Role of Gunas**: Influenced by **Sattva** (harmony and clarity), *Vicara* contemplates the essence or meanings beyond physical forms.
  - **Savicara Samapatti**: In this state, the mind moves beyond gross objects to engage with the subtle aspects of reality, reflecting on the ideal divisions that arise from conceptual distinctions.

#### **Division of the Gunas**

- **Overview of the Gunas**:
  In Yoga and Samkhya philosophy, **Gunas** are the three fundamental qualities that constitute all of nature (*Prakriti*). They are:
  1. **Sattva**: Quality of harmony, balance, purity, and light.
  2. **Rajas**: Quality of activity, passion, energy, and movement.
  3. **Tamas**: Quality of inertia, darkness, heaviness, and ignorance.

- **Role in Creation**:
  - **Real Divisions**: Result from the interplay of **Rajas** and **Tamas**, creating physical distinctions and material forms.
  - **Ideal Divisions**: Emerge from the influence of **Sattva**, facilitating the mind's ability to conceptualize and reflect on abstract ideas and essences.

---

### **3. Fichte's Key Principles Aligned with Yoga Sutras**

#### **Fichte's Remarks and Their Integration**

##### **3.1. Specifying the Boundary Between Factical and Philosophical Insight**

**Fichte's Point 1:**
> "I have now specified the boundary point between absolutely all factical insight and truly philosophical and genetic insight entirely and exactly, and I have opened up the sources of the entirely new world in concepts which appear only in the science of knowing. The creation and essence of this new world is found just here, in the negation of the primordial disjunctive act as immediate and in the insight into this primordial act's principle materially, that it is thus, and formally, that it is at all."

**Integration:**
- **Boundary Specification**: Fichte distinguishes between **factical insight** (empirical, sensory-based understanding) and **philosophical/genetic insight** (conceptual, foundational understanding).

- **Relation to Savitarka Samapatti**:
  - In *Savitarka*, the practitioner engages primarily with **factical insights**, reasoning about real divisions influenced by the Gunas.
  - The transition to *Vicara* involves moving towards **philosophical/genetic insights**, contemplating ideal divisions that arise from conceptual understanding.

- **Negation of Primordial Disjunctive Act**:
  - The primordial act of separation into Being and Thinking is negated through deeper philosophical insight, aligning with the practitioner's progression from *Vitarka* to *Vicara*.

##### **3.2. Essence of the Final Scientific Form**

**Fichte's Point 2:**
> "I have here explained the essence of the final scientific form of the science of knowing from a single point more precisely than I have been able to do previously. The main point of this scientific form resides in seeing into the oneness of the distinguishing ground: of being and thinking as one and of sensible and supersensible (as I will say in the meantime) as one. Whoever has understood this [as it is to be understood up to now, namely as an empty form] and holds on to it firmly, can scarcely make any further errors in the subsequent actual employment of this form."

**Integration:**
- **Unity of Distinguishing Grounds**: Fichte emphasizes the inseparability of **Being and Thinking** as well as **Sensible and Supersensible** aspects.

- **Relation to Savitarka and Vicara**:
  - *Savitarka* engages with the **sensible** aspects (Real Divisions), while *Vicara* contemplates the **supersensible** aspects (Ideal Divisions).
  - Understanding the unity of these grounds ensures that practitioners do not make errors in progressing toward higher states of consciousness.

- **Empty Form**:
  - Initially, distinctions are seen as provisional ("empty forms") to facilitate understanding, but deeper insight reveals their unified nature.

##### **3.3. Path of the Lectures: From Factical to Genetic Insight**

**Fichte's Point 3:**
> "In order to assist both your memories and repeated reproduction: in the last hour I said that the path of our lectures was, and would for a long time continue to be, that we first present something in factical manifestness and then would ascend to a genetic insight into this object on the basis of its principles. This is exactly what we have done in the just-completed explanation. Already since the second lecture, we had developed the inseparability of both recognized distinguishing grounds historically out of Kant's own statement, and we admitted the factical correctness of this statement. Now we raise ourselves [to be sure not to a genetic insight into the principle of this inseparability, since we do not yet actually know this inseparability itself, nor its terms, but have only assumed all this temporarily and for the time being] but to the genetic insight, which must be the form of this principle, if such inseparability and such a genetic principle are to exist."

**Integration:**
- **Factical to Genetic Insight Pathway**: Fichte outlines a methodological approach where initial empirical observations (*factical manifestness*) lead to deeper conceptual understanding (*genetic insight*).

- **Relation to Meditation Practice**:
  - **Savitarka Samapatti** corresponds to the **factical manifestness**, where the practitioner engages with real divisions through reasoning.
  - **Vicara Samapatti** represents the **genetic insight**, where the practitioner ascends to a deeper, principled understanding of ideal divisions.

- **Inseparability of Distinguishing Grounds**:
  - Recognizing the inseparability of Being and Thinking, and Sensible and Supersensible, ensures a coherent progression from empirical reasoning to profound insight.

- **Inseparability of Distinguishing Grounds**: Being and Thinking are inseparable grounds that cannot exist without each other. They are disjunctive terms of a higher oneness.

- **Conceptual Grasping**: The science of knowing must grasp these grounds conceptually, seeing them as part of a higher organic unity rather than as isolated entities.

- **Avoiding One-Sidedness**: Recognize that viewing the principle solely as oneness or disjunction is one-sided. True understanding requires embracing both aspects as part of an organic oneness.

#### **Relation to Yoga Philosophy**

- **Genetic and Mediated Path**: The progression from *Savitarka* to *Vicara* represents a genetic and mediated journey towards understanding the inseparable nature of Being and Thinking.

- **Conceptual Tools in Meditation**: The initial conceptual distinctions made during *Savitarka* serve as tools to facilitate deeper insight, ultimately leading to the realization of their unity in higher states like *Nirvitarka* and *Nirbija Samadhi*.

- **Organic Unity in Practice**: Meditation embodies Fichte's principle by actively engaging with both Being and Thinking, integrating them into a unified experience.

---

### **8. Overcoming the Limitations of Expression**

#### **Fichte's Perspective**

- **Limitations of Language**: Verbal and diagrammatic expressions are inadequate to fully capture the simultaneous and inseparable nature of Being and Thinking.

- **Inner Insight vs. External Expression**: True comprehension of the principle requires moving beyond external expressions and experiencing it directly through inner insight.

- **Transcending Conceptual Constructs**: The ultimate understanding of oneness transcends conceptual constructs and must be lived and experienced.

#### **Relation to Meditation Experience**

- **Beyond Words**: In deeper meditative states, the practitioner transcends words and concepts, directly experiencing the unity of Being and Thinking.

- **Inner Insight**: Meditation cultivates inner insight that surpasses what can be conveyed through language, aligning with Fichte's emphasis on experiential knowledge.

- **Unity of Experience**: The realization of oneness is an experiential understanding that language can only approximate, emphasizing the importance of direct experience in meditation.

  - **Role of Gunas**: Influenced by the interplay of the **Gunas**, particularly **Rajas** (activity) and **Tamas** (inertia), *Vitarka* engages with the tangible aspects of existence.
  - **Savitarka Samapatti**: In this meditative state, the mind discerns distinctions between word (*sabda*), meaning (*artha*), and knowledge (*jnana*), navigating the real divisions shaped by the Gunas.

- **Vicara (Ideal Divisions)**:
  - **Definition**: *Vicara* involves reflection on **Ideal Divisions**, referring to conceptual, mental, or abstract distinctions made by the mind.
  - **Role of Gunas**: Influenced by **Sattva** (harmony and clarity), *Vicara* contemplates the essence or meanings beyond physical forms.
  - **Savicara Samapatti**: In this state, the mind moves beyond gross objects to engage with the subtle aspects of reality, reflecting on the ideal divisions that arise from conceptual distinctions.

#### **Division of the Gunas**

- **Overview of the Gunas**:
  In Yoga and Samkhya philosophy, **Gunas** are the three fundamental qualities that constitute all of nature (*Prakriti*). They are:
  1. **Sattva**: Quality of harmony, balance, purity, and light.
  2. **Rajas**: Quality of activity, passion, energy, and movement.
  3. **Tamas**: Quality of inertia, darkness, heaviness, and ignorance.

- **Role in Creation**:
  - **Real Divisions**: Result from the interplay of **Rajas** and **Tamas**, creating physical distinctions and material forms.
  - **Ideal Divisions**: Emerge from the influence of **Sattva**, facilitating the mind's ability to conceptualize and reflect on abstract ideas and essences.

### **3. Fichte's Additional Remarks and Their Integration**

#### **3.1. Specifying the Boundary Between Factical and Philosophical Insight**

**Fichte's Remark 1:**
> "I have now specified the boundary point between absolutely all factical insight and truly philosophical and genetic insight entirely and exactly, and I have opened up the sources of the entirely new world in concepts which appear only in the science of knowing. The creation and essence of this new world is found just here, in the negation of the primordial disjunctive act as immediate and in the insight into this primordial act's principle materially, that it is thus, and formally, that it is at all."

**Integration:**

- **Boundary Specification**:
  - Fichte delineates between **factical insight** (*Savitarka*) and **philosophical/genetic insight** (*Vicara*).
  - This aligns with the transition from reasoning about Real Divisions to reflecting on Ideal Divisions.

- **Negation of Primordial Disjunctive Act**:
  - The initial separation of Being and Thinking is negated through deeper philosophical insight, paralleling the meditator's movement from *Vitarka* to *Vicara*.

- **Creation of a New World in Concepts**:
  - The development of *Vicara* represents the emergence of new conceptual frameworks, similar to Fichte's creation of a "new world" in the **Science of Knowing**.

#### **3.2. Essence of the Final Scientific Form**

**Fichte's Remark 2:**
> "I have here explained the essence of the final scientific form of the science of knowing from a single point more precisely than I have been able to do previously. The main point of this scientific form resides in seeing into the oneness of the distinguishing ground: of being and thinking as one and of sensible and supersensible (as I will say in the meantime) as one. Whoever has understood this [as it is to be understood up to now, namely as an empty form] and holds on to it firmly, can scarcely make any further errors in the subsequent actual employment of this form."

**Integration:**

- **Unity of Distinguishing Grounds**:
  - Emphasizes the inseparability of **Being and Thinking** as well as **Sensible and Supersensible**.
  - Reflects the integrated practice of *Vitarka* and *Vicara* in meditation.

- **Empty Form**:
  - Initial conceptual distinctions serve as provisional tools ("empty forms") to facilitate deeper understanding.
  - Ensures that practitioners do not mistake these provisional distinctions for absolute truths, maintaining progression toward higher insight.

#### **3.3. Path of the Lectures: From Factical to Genetic Insight**

**Fichte's Remark 3:**
> "In order to assist both your memories and repeated reproduction: in the last hour I said that the path of our lectures was, and would for a long time continue to be, that we first present something in factical manifestness and then would ascend to a genetic insight into this object on the basis of its principles. This is exactly what we have done in the just-completed explanation. Already since the second lecture, we had developed the inseparability of both recognized distinguishing grounds historically out of Kant's own statement, and we admitted the factical correctness of this statement. Now we raise ourselves [to be sure not to a genetic insight into the principle of this inseparability, since we do not yet actually know this inseparability itself, nor its terms, but have only assumed all this temporarily and for the time being] but to the genetic insight, which must be the form of this principle, if such inseparability and such a genetic principle are to exist)."

**Integration:**

- **Methodological Approach**:
  - **Factical Manifestness to Genetic Insight**: Mirrors the meditative progression from *Vitarka* to *Vicara*.
  - **Inseparability of Distinguishing Grounds**: Reinforces the unified approach to Being and Thinking, Sensible and Supersensible, as essential for true understanding.

- **Temporary Assumptions**:
  - Acknowledges that initial assumptions or provisional distinctions are necessary stepping stones toward deeper, genetic insights.
  - Encourages practitioners to view *Savitarka* as a foundational stage leading to *Vicara* and beyond.

- **Scientific Form and Principles**:
  - The integration of empirical observations with conceptual insights aligns with the formation of scientific principles, paralleling the meditative journey toward realization.

### **4. Principle of Oneness: Genetic and Mediated Understanding**

**Fichte's Continuation:**
> "so really Vitarka deals with Real Divisions and Vicara deals with Ideal Divisions. This is a key concept in Yoga called the Division of the Gunas."

**Fichte's Further Remarks:**
> "And now a number of additional remarks. I ask that you not allow yourself to be distracted while I state them:
>
> 1. I have now specified the boundary point between absolutely all factical insight and truly philosophical and genetic insight entirely and exactly, and I have opened up the sources of the entirely new world in concepts which appear only in the science of knowing. The creation and essence of this new world is found just here, in the negation of the primordial disjunctive act as immediate and in the insight into this primordial act's principle materially, that it is thus, and formally, that it is at all.
>
> 2. I have here explained the essence of the final scientific form of the science of knowing from a single point more precisely than I have been able to do previously. The main point of this scientific form resides in seeing into the oneness of the distinguishing ground: of being and thinking as one and of sensible and supersensible (as I will say in the meantime) as one. Whoever has understood this [as it is to be understood up to now, namely as an empty form] and holds on to it firmly, can scarcely make any further errors in the subsequent actual employment of this form.
>
> 3. In order to assist both your memories and repeated reproduction: in the last hour I said that the path of our lectures was, and would for a long time continue to be, that we first present something in factical manifestness and then would ascend to a genetic insight into this object on the basis of its principles.

By integrating the analogy of **OM as A U M** into our analysis of the Yoga Sutras and Fichte's **Science of Knowing**, we achieve a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the interplay between **Vitarka** and **Vicara**, **Real** and **Ideal Divisions**, and the **Division of the Gunas**. This comprehensive framework bridges Eastern meditative practices with Western philosophical inquiry, illuminating the universal principles underlying the pursuit of knowledge and self-realization.

- **Principle of Science**:
  - The union of **Being** and **Thinking** as an inseparable, dynamic principle aligns with the stages of *Savitarka* and *Vicara*, where reasoning and reflection are interconnected aspects of consciousness.

- **Vitarka and Vicara**:
  - *Vitarka* engages with **Real Divisions** (Being), while *Vicara* engages with **Ideal Divisions** (Thinking), reflecting the inseparable nature of these concepts as emphasized by Fichte.

- **Division of the Gunas**:
  - The interplay of the Gunas shapes both Real and Ideal Divisions, influencing the practitioner's engagement with the material and conceptual aspects of reality.

- **Philosophical Integration**:
  - This distinction aligns with Fichte's and Hegel's views on the unity of Being and Thinking, reflecting the dialectical process of integrating opposites to achieve higher understanding.
