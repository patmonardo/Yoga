First Lecture
Monday, April 16, 1804
Honorable Guests:

Without doubt: philosophy should present the truth.
But what is truth,
and what do we actually search for
when we search for it?
```

-   **The Nature of Truth:** He doesn't assume 'truth' as a given. Instead, he challenges us to think deeply about what it means and how it relates to the philosophical quest.

-   **The Aim of Inquiry:** The search for truth isn't just about finding answers; it's about understanding what we're looking for in the first place.

-   **Definitions vs. Experience:** Could there be different kinds of 'truth'? Does philosophy deal with abstract definitions or a more profound form of truth found in experience?

-   **Truth and Subjectivity:** How does Fichte's focus on 'knowing' (from previous discussions) influence his approach to 'truth'? Is truth purely objective, or is there a subjective element?

-   **The Function of Questions:** Why does he start with open-ended questions rather than providing definitions? Does this reveal something about his philosophical method?

```
Let's just consider what we will not allow to count as truth:
namely when things can be this way or equally well the other;
for example the multiplicity and variability of opinion.
Thus, truth is absolute oneness and invariability of opinion.
So that I can let go of the supplemental term “opinion,”
since it will take us too far afield,
let me say that the essence of philosophy
would consist in this: to trace all multiplicity
(which presses itself upon us in the usual view of life)
back to absolute oneness.
I have stated this point briefly;
and now the main thing is not to take it superficially,
but energetically and as something which ought
in all seriousness to hold good.
```

**What Truth Is Not:**

-   **No Relativity:** He rejects a notion of truth as subjective or dependent upon variable opinions. This suggests he's seeking a fundamental, unchanging truth.
-   **Against Multiplicity:** Truth, for Fichte, seems incompatible with a multiplicity of perspectives or potential interpretations.

**What Truth Is:**

-   **Absolute Oneness:** He equates truth with a singular, unified understanding that transcends individual variations in thought.
-   **The Task of Philosophy:** The core function of philosophy becomes revealing this underlying unity beneath the apparent diversity and multiplicity of everyday experience.

**Key Warnings:**

-   **Deeper Meaning:** Fichte cautions against taking his statements superficially, hinting at complexities and nuances yet to be revealed.

-   **Active Engagement:** He uses the word 'energetically,' emphasizing that a true understanding requires an active process of inquiry, not a passive acceptance of his words.

-   **Subjectivity's Role:** How does this focus on unity square with our earlier discussions of the subjective element in knowing, and the oscillations within the Science of Knowing?

-   **The Nature of Oneness:** What kind of 'oneness' underlies multiplicity? Is it a purely abstract principle, or is there a dynamic aspect to its unity?

-   **Implications for Experience:** If our everyday experience is filled with multiplicity, does this make it inherently 'untrue' within Fichte's system?

```
All multiplicity whatever can even be distinguished, or
has its antithesis, or counterpart, absolutely without exception.
Wherever even the possibility of a distinction remains,
whether explicitly or tacitly, the task is not completed.
Whoever can point out the smallest distinction in or
with regard to what some philosophical system has posited
as its highest principle has refuted that system.
```

-   **Universal Distinctions:** Fichte asserts that ALL multiplicity implies the existence of an antithesis or counterpart. This seems to be an intrinsic property of his philosophical worldview.

-   **Task Unfinished:** Any possibility for even the most subtle distinction undermines a claim of absolute oneness, indicating that the philosophical task remains incomplete.

-   **Challenge of Refutation:** Demonstrating even the slightest distinction within a philosophical system's highest principle constitutes a valid refutation of that system.

-   **Limits of Oneness:** Does this mean a truly absolute oneness cannot be conceptualized or expressed, as any attempt would introduce distinctions?

-   **Is Multiplicity Real?** Is the existence of multiplicity an illusion within Fichte's system, or does it have a distinct role alongside the absolute oneness?

-   **The Basis of Distinctions:** What is the origin of these antitheses or counterparts that inevitably accompany any element of multiplicity?

-   **Practical Implications:** How does this strict insistence on absolute oneness guide the process of 'tracing back' multiplicity within the Science of Knowing?

```
As is obvious from this, absolute oneness is
what is true and in itself unchangeable,
its opposite purely contained within itself.
“To trace back”, precisely in the continuing insight of
the philosopher himself as follows:
that he reciprocally conceives multiplicity through oneness
and oneness through multiplicity.
That is, that, as a principle, Oneness = A illuminates
such multiplicity for him;
and conversely, that multiplicity in its ontological ground can
be grasped only as proceeding from A.
```

-   **Oneness as the True:** Absolute oneness is defined as the unchangeable, self-contained fundamental principle of his system.

-   **Dynamic Process:** The philosopher's ongoing task is to trace multiplicity back to this oneness and conversely, understand oneness as the source of multiplicity.

-   **Reciprocal Understanding:** This involves a constant interplay where oneness illuminates the structure of multiplicity, and multiplicity reveals the necessity of its origination from oneness.

-   **Symbolic Representation:** He introduces the symbol 'A' to represent this absolute oneness.

-   **The Status of Multiplicity:** Does multiplicity have any real existence within this system, or is it ultimately derived from the foundational oneness?

-   **The Philosopher's Power:** How does the philosopher achieve this dynamic understanding? Is it purely intellectual, or does it involve a transformation of consciousness?

-   **Symbol & Meaning:** Why choose the symbol 'A'? Does it hold deeper significance, or is it merely a placeholder for the absolute?

```
Since, as a result, absolutely all
philosophical systems must agree,
to the extent that they wish to
exist on their own apart from history,
the difference between them,
taken initially in a superficial and historical manner,
can only reside in what they propose as oneness,
the one true self-contained in-itself
(e.g., the absolute; therefore one could say in passing that
the task of philosophy could be expressed as
the presentation of the absolute).
```

-   **Fundamental Agreement:** Despite their apparent differences, Fichte suggests that all philosophical systems must ultimately share a common goal if they aim to be self-sufficient and grounded in truth.

-   **Nature of Difference:** The distinction between various philosophical systems hinges on what they propose as the absolute oneness, the foundational self-contained principle.

-   **The Absolute:** He introduces the concept of "the absolute" as an example of this kind of foundational oneness and hints that the primary task of philosophy is its presentation.

-   **Is Agreement Possible?** Can seemingly contradictory philosophical systems truly share a common core if they posit different absolutes?

-   **Criteria for Truth:** How does Fichte determine what qualifies as a valid 'absolute' on which a philosophical system can be built?

-   **Presentation vs. Understanding:** Is the mere presentation of "the absolute" sufficient, or does true understanding involve grasping its relationship to the world of multiplicity?

```
But surely everyone who is willing to reflect
can perceive that absolutely all being
posits a thinking or consciousness of itself;
and that therefore mere being is always
only one half of a whole together
with the thought of it,
and is therefore one term of
an original and more general disjunction,
a fact which is lost only on the unreflective and superficial.
Thus, absolute oneness can no more reside
in being than in its correlative consciousness;
it can as little be posited in the thing as
in the representation of the thing.
Rather, it resides in the principle,
which we have just discovered,
of the absolute oneness and indivisibility of both,
which is equally, as we have seen,
the principle of their disjunction.
```

-   **Inseparability of Being & Consciousness:** He asserts the fundamental interconnectedness of being and the awareness of it. Neither exists independently, always present as two halves of a dynamic whole.

-   **Beyond Mere Being:** Due to this interconnectedness, absolute oneness cannot reside solely in 'being', as it implies a distinction from its corresponding awareness.

-   **Rejecting Representation:** Similarly, absolute oneness cannot rest in the mere representation of a thing, as it presupposes the existence of that which is represented.

-   **Oneness in the Principle:** True oneness lies in the underlying principle that unifies, yet splits, being and consciousness. This principle is both the basis for their unity and for their necessary distinction.

-   **Nature of the Principle:** What is this principle of 'absolute oneness and indivisibility' that transcends being and consciousness? Is it a purely conceptual construct, or does it hint at a deeper ontological reality?

-   **Paradox of Unity & Division:** How does this principle simultaneously hold together and split apart these concepts?

-   **Implications for Knowing:** How does this shift alter our understanding of the act of knowing and the relationship between the knower and what is known?

```
We will name this principle pure knowing, knowing in itself,
and, thus, completely objectless knowing,
because otherwise it would not be knowing in itself
but would require objectivity for its being.
```

-   **The Name:** He labels the principle that unifies and divides being/consciousness as 'pure knowing' (also translated as "pure knowledge").

-   **Objectless Nature:** This pure knowing is defined as objectless. Without an object, it is purely self-referential, knowing itself in and for itself.

-   **Self-Sufficiency:** By being objectless, this knowing is not dependent on an external reality for its existence.

-   **Experience vs. Definition:** Is this 'pure knowing' meant as a definition or as something to be directly experienced?

-   **Paradox of Knowing Itself:** How can knowledge be of itself? Does this create circularity, or does it hint at a non-dual mode of understanding?

-   **Implications for Existence:** If this knowing doesn't have an object, what is the relationship between this foundational principle and the world of seemingly external objects that we experience?

```
It is distinct from consciousness,
which posits a being and is therefore only a half.
This is Kant's discovery, and is what makes him the founder
of  Transcendental Philosophy. Like Kantian philosophy,
the Science of Knowing is transcendental philosophy,
and thus it resembles Kant's philosophy in that
it does not posit the absolute in the thing, as previously,
or in subjective knowing, which is simply impossible,
because whomever reflects on this second term already has the first,
but in the oneness of both.
```

-   **Beyond Duality:** Pure knowing is distinct from consciousness, which includes the duality of being and its representation, making it only a partial element.

-   **Kant's Contribution:** Fichte credits Kant for recognizing this limitation of consciousness and founding Transcendental Philosophy, which focuses on the structures of knowing that underlie experience.

-   **Similarity to Kant:** The Science of Knowing aligns with this transcendental approach by not positing the absolute solely in the external world ('the thing') or the subjective mind.

-   **Avoiding the Trap:** Fichte emphasizes that the absolute cannot be located solely in subjective knowing, as this implies a prior awareness of that which is being known.

-   **Oneness as Foundation:** Instead, the absolute rests in the principle that unifies being and consciousness.

-   **Pure Knowing & Consciousness:** How does ordinary consciousness arise from this foundational 'pure knowing'? Is there a clear transition between them?

-   **Implications of Transcendentalism:** How does adopting this transcendental stance shape Fichte's approach to understanding reality and the nature of knowledge?

-   **Departures from Kant:** While Fichte acknowledges a kinship with Kant, are there key areas where the Science of Knowing diverges from Transcendental Philosophy?

Second Lecture
Wednesday, April 18, 1804
Honorable Guests:

If one reflects properly, absolutely all being presupposes
a thought or consciousness having that being as its object;
that consequently being is a term of a disjunction,
the other half of which is thinking;
and that for this reason oneness is not to be found
in the one or the other but in the connection of both.
```

-   **Inseparability of Being & Thought:** He asserts that all being necessarily implies a thought or consciousness that has it as its object. Existence and its awareness cannot be separated.

-   **Being as Part of a Whole:** This suggests that being is not a self-contained absolute but rather one side of a duality, the other being thinking or consciousness.

-   **Oneness Beyond the Duality:** True oneness, the foundation he seeks, cannot reside solely in either being or consciousness but lies in their underlying connection.

-   **Primacy of Consciousness:** Does this imply that consciousness is somehow more fundamental than being? Or, are they equally arising from a deeper principle?

-   **The Nature of 'Object':** What is meant by 'object' here? Is it limited to material objects, or does it encompass anything that consciousness is aware of?

-   **Implications for Existence:** If everything that exists presupposes consciousness, does this mean the world is, in a sense, a product of mind?

```
Oneness thus is the same as pure knowing in and for itself,
and therefore it is knowledge of nothing;
or in case you find the following expression easier to remember,
it (oneness) is found in truth and certainty,
which is not certainty about any particular thing,
since in that case the disjunction of being and knowing is already posited.
```

-   **Oneness = Pure Knowing:** He equates the underlying principle of oneness with 'pure knowing in and for itself'. This reinforces their foundational role in his system.

-   **Knowledge of Nothing:** This pure knowing is not knowledge "about" something specific; it lacks an object and thus exists as a self-contained awareness.

-   **Truth & Certainty:** He suggests an equivalency between oneness and a state of absolute truth and certainty, one that transcends any particular conviction about a specific thing.

-   **Paradox of Knowledge:** How can knowledge exist without a known object? Does this point toward a non-dualistic mode of understanding?

-   **Certainty's Basis:** If certainty doesn't rest on belief in particular things, what is its foundation? Is it grounded in the self-awareness of pure knowing?

-   **Implications for Experience:** How does this concept of objectless knowledge and absolute certainty relate to our everyday experience of objects and multiple beliefs?

```
Or, this thing which is neither being nor consciousness
but rather the oneness of both,
which has been presented as the absolute oneness of
the transcendental philosophy,
can be indicated with these words.
```

-   **Beyond Being & Consciousness:** He emphasizes that the absolute principle he seeks is neither purely ontological (being) nor purely epistemological (consciousness). It transcends this duality.

-   **Oneness of Both:** The essence of this principle is the intrinsic oneness or unity that underlies and gives rise to the apparent division between being and consciousness.

-   **Transcendental Link:** This resonates with the core aim of transcendental philosophy – to identify the fundamental structures of knowing that shape our experience of reality.

-   **Nature of the 'Oneness':** Is this oneness merely a theoretical construct, or does it hint at an underlying reality that is experiential?

-   **Transcendental Idealism:** How does Fichte's version of transcendental philosophy differ from Kant's, especially regarding the nature of this foundational principle?

-   **Linguistic Limitations:** Does he suggest any inadequacy of language for expressing this principle that transcends traditional categories?

```
But this cannot yet be completely clear and transparent to you,
because all philosophy is contained in
the transparency of this oneness,
and from here on we will do nothing else
but work on heightening the clarity of this one concept,
in which at one stroke I have given you the whole.
If it were already completely clear to you,
you would not need me any longer.
Nevertheless, I would add that everyone must possess
more than the bare empty formula.
One must also have a living image of this oneness
which is firmly fixed and which never leaves him.
With my lectures I attend to this, your fixed image;
we will extend and clarify it together.
If someone does not have this image,
there is no way for me to address them, and
for this person my whole discourse becomes talk about nothing,
since in fact I will discuss nothing except this image.

What is the Science of Knowing?

All transcendental philosophy, such as Kant's
(and in this respect the Science of Knowing is
not yet different from his philosophy),
posits the absolute neither in being nor in consciousness
but in the union of both.
Truth and certainty in and for itself = A.
It follows, I say, that for this kind of philosophy
the difference between being and thinking,
as valid in itself, totally disappears.
Indeed, everything that can arise in such a philosophy
is contained in the epiphany which we already consummated
in ourselves during the last lecture;
in the insight that no being is possible without thinking,
and vice versa — wholly being and thinking at the same time,
and nothing can occur in the manifest sphere of being
without simultaneously occurring in the manifest sphere of thinking,
if one just considers rightly rather than simply dreaming,
and vice versa. Thus in the vision, which is given and granted,
there is nothing primarily of concern for us
as transcendental philosophers.
```

-   **Beyond Dualism:** Like Kant, the Science of Knowing posits the absolute in the union of being and consciousness, not solely in either side of the duality.

-   **Truth & Certainty as 'A':** He reiterates that this foundational unity is embodied by the symbol 'A', representing absolute truth and certainty.

-   **Disappearance of the Divide:** Within this philosophy, the distinction between being and thinking loses its fundamental significance.

-   **Foundation Established:** Fichte claims that the core insight – the inseparability of being and thinking – was arrived at in the previous lecture, allowing him to build upon this.

-   **Mutual Implication:** Nothing can exist solely on the side of being or thinking. Changes in one sphere necessarily have corresponding changes in the other, for the truly observant.

-   **Beyond Vision:** Fichte claims that this insight is so fundamental that transcendental philosophers don't need to directly concern themselves with it anymore.

-   **Kantian Departure:** Does Fichte's insistence on the disappearance of the divide fully align with Kant's approach, or does it hint at his unique path?

-   **Implications for Experience:** If distinction fades, how does he explain the apparent gap between our thoughts and the external world we perceive?

-   **Methodological Shift:** If this core insight is established, what becomes the focus of the Science of Knowing going forward?

```
But according to our insight that the absolute is
not a half but indivisible oneness,
an insight which reaches beyond all appearance,
it is absolutely and in itself neither being nor thinking, but rather:

     A
   /   \
  A  .  —B T—

If now, in order to apply what has just been said and
to make it even clearer it is assumed that,
in addition to its absolute, fundamental division into B and T,
A also divides itself into x, y, z, then it follows:
1. that everything together in and for itself,
including absolute A, and x, etc., is only just a modification of A;
from this follows directly
1. that it all must occur in B as well as in T.
```

-   **Beyond Duality:** He emphasizes that the absolute ('A') is not simply being or thinking but exists prior to this fundamental division.

-   **The Diagram:**

-   **A as Unity:** 'A' at the top represents the absolute oneness.

-   **Primary Division:** The splitting line signifies the fundamental division into 'B' (being) and 'T' (thinking).

-   **Internal Complexity:** Fichte allows for further division of 'A' into 'x', 'y', 'z', suggesting potential internal relationships within the absolute.

-   **Modifications of A:** All these divisions, including the absolute 'A' itself, are ultimately modifications of the unifying principle.

-   **Universality of the Division:** He asserts that everything occurring within A must manifest in both the spheres of being (B) and thinking (T).

-   **Origin of Division:** What causes the initial division of 'A' and the subsequent internal divisions? Is this an inherent property of the absolute?

-   **Implications of the Diagram:** How does this diagram help understand the relationship between the absolute and the world of experience?

-   **Dynamic Process:** Does the division imply a process in time, or is it a simultaneous, structural characteristic of the absolute?

```
Assume also that there is a philosophical system
that has no doubts that the dichotomy of B and T,
which arises from A, is mere appearance, and
that therefore it would be a genuine transcendental philosophy;
but assume further that this philosophy remained caught in such
an absolute division of A into x, y, z, just as we proposed.
Thus, this system, for all its transcendentalism,
would still not have penetrated through to pure oneness,
nor would it have completed the task of philosophy.
Having eluded one disjunction, it would have fallen into another;
and despite all the admiration one must show it
for first discovering the primordial illusion,
nevertheless with the discovery of this new disjunction,
it is refuted as the true, fully accomplished, philosophy.
```

-   **A Hypothetical System:** He imagines a philosophical system that:

-   Acknowledges the illusory nature of the absolute divide between being (B) and thinking (T).

-   Remains caught in the internal divisions within the absolute ('A' dividing into 'x, y, z').

-   **Incomplete Oneness:** Such a system, despite its transcendental leanings, fails to grasp the true, pure oneness and thus falls short of completing the task of philosophy.

-   **Trapped in Disjunction:** By focusing on the internal divisions, it falls victim to a different kind of dualism, undermining its claim to have found the absolute.

-   **Respect & Refutation:** Fichte expresses admiration for the system's initial insight but argues that the newly discovered disjunction ultimately refutes its claim to be the 'true' philosophy.

-   **Purpose of the Example:** Why does Fichte create this hypothetical system? Does it represent a flaw in other philosophies (like Kant's), or is it a tool for clarifying his own approach?

-   **Nature of the 'True' Philosophy:** What further steps would a system need to take to achieve the absolute oneness that Fichte envisions?

-   **Criteria for Success:** How does Fichte determine whether a philosophical system has genuinely overcome disjunctions and arrived at the absolute?

```
The Kantian system is exactly this very one,
precisely characterized by the outline I have just given.
Kant conceived A as the indivisible union of being and thinking.
But he did not conceive it in its
pure self-sufficiency in and for itself,
as the Science of Knowing presents it,
but rather only as a common basic determination or accident
of its three primordial modes, x, y, z;
(these expressions are meaningful; it cannot be said more precisely)
as a result of which for him there are actually three absolutes and
the true unitary absolute fades to their common property.
```

-   **Kant's Insight:** Fichte acknowledges that Kant grasped the concept of 'A', the undifferentiated unity of being and thinking.

-   **Kant's Limitation:** However, Kant did not understand 'A' in its pure self-sufficiency but only as a common characteristic within a threefold division ('x, y, z').

-   **Fragmented Absolutes:** This leads to Kant having three separate absolutes, rather than the unitary absolute that Fichte seeks.

-   **Linguistic Precision:** While using the symbols 'x, y, z,' Fichte admits that he cannot precisely express what he means (perhaps intentionally).

-   **Understanding Kant:** Does Fichte accurately represent Kant's system? Are there ways to defend Kant against this critique?

-   **Fichte's Symbols:** What might 'x, y, z' represent within Fichte's system? Are they connected to any specific concepts he has introduced?

-   **Beyond Critique:** How does Fichte use the limitations he perceives in Kant to strengthen and refine his own conception of the absolute?

```
Its essence consists first in discovering the root
(indiscernible for Kant)
in which the sensible and supersensible worlds come together
and then in providing the actual conceptual derivation of
both worlds from a single principle.
```

**The Core Task:** Fichte identifies two main goals of his system:

1.  **Uncovering the Root Unity:** To discover the underlying principle where the sensible (observable world of experience) and supersensible (the realm beyond direct perception) worlds converge. Kant failed to identify this common root.
2.  **Conceptual Derivation:** To provide a rigorous conceptual explanation for how both the sensible and supersensible worlds arise from this single, unifying principle.

-   **Nature of the 'Root':** What might Fichte mean by this 'root' or unifying principle that bridges the sensible and supersensible? How is it different from Kant's approach?
-   **Derivation vs. Presupposition:** How does 'deriving' these spheres from a single principle differ from merely assuming or positing their existence?
-   **Implications for Knowledge:** What does it mean for the Science of Knowing to achieve such a derivation? Does this guarantee absolute certainty about the nature of reality?

```
To avoid all misunderstanding let me add that
if it too must finally admit something inconceivable,
then at least it will conceive it as just what it is,
absolutely inconceivable, and as nothing more;
and thus too it will conceive the point at which
absolute conceiving is able to begin.
```

-   **Acknowledging the Inconceivable:** He concedes that even the Science of Knowing may ultimately have to confront something beyond the grasp of conceptual thought.

-   **Transparent Limitation:** Crucially, his system will recognize this inconceivable element for what it is – absolutely beyond understanding. It won't be misconstrued or given attributes it cannot have.

-   **Defining the Boundary:** By clearly recognizing the 'inconceivable', his system also delineates the point where conceptual understanding can begin, establishing a clear limit.

-   **Nature of the Inconceivable:** Does this reference the same 'inconceivable' as in his earlier discussions, or is this a new context?

-   **Paradox of Conceiving:** How can the 'inconceivable' be truly conceived, even if it is only to acknowledge its own unknowable nature?

-   **Practical Implications:** How does this methodological clarity about the 'inconceivable' affect the construction of the rest of his system?

```
Let me give this characterization in pure concepts, higher than,
and independently of, historical setting, and present its schema:
A is admitted; it divides itself both into'
B and T and simultaneously into x, y, z.
Both divisions are equally absolute;
one is not possible without the other.
Therefore, the insight with which the Science of Knowing begins
and which constitutes its distinction from Kantianism is not at all
to be found in the insight into the division into B and T
which we already also completed in the last lecture,
nor in the insight into the division of x, y, z
which we have still not finished
but have problematically presupposed;
rather it is to be found in the insight into
the immediate inseparability of these two modes of division.
Therefore the two divisions cannot be seen into immediately,
as it seemed from the outset until now;
instead they can be seen into only mediately
through the higher insight into their oneness.
```

-   **The Schema:**

-   'A' as the Absolute: Fichte begins with the absolute oneness represented by 'A'.

-   Dual Divisions: 'A' divides simultaneously into: \* B (being) and T (thinking) \* x, y, z (further internal divisions whose explanation is pending)

-   Equivalence of Divisions: Both sets of divisions are equally absolute and interdependent.

-   **Distinguishing Insight:** The fundamental insight that sets the Science of Knowing apart is NOT simply the recognition of these divisions but recognizing their immediate, inseparable unity.

-   **Mediated Understanding:** The divisions within 'A' cannot be directly grasped but are only understood through the higher insight into their essential oneness.

-   **Significance of 'x, y, z':** What do these additional divisions represent? How do they relate back to the concepts introduced earlier?

-   **Paradox of Inseparability:** How can divisions be simultaneously absolute and inseparable? What kind of unity does Fichte envision?

-   **Methodological Shift:** How does this focus on the unity of divisions change the approach of the Science of Knowing going forward?

Third Lecture
Thursday, April 19, 1804
Honorable Guests:

Absolute A is divided into
B and T and into x, y, z;
all at one stroke.
As into x, y, z, so into B and T;
as into B and T, so into x, y, z.
But how have I expressed myself just now?
Once commencing with x and the other time commencing with B.
This is just a perspective, a bias in my speaking.
I certainly know, and even expressly assert,
that implicitly, beyond the possibilities of
my mode of expression and my discursive construction,
both are totally identical, completely comprehended
in one self-contained stroke.
Therefore, I am constructing what cannot be constructed,
with full awareness that it cannot be constructed.
```

-   **Simultaneous Divisions:** He emphasizes that the absolute 'A' divides into 'B' (being) & 'T' (thinking) AND into 'x', 'y', 'z' simultaneously, in a single act.

-   **Equivalence of Divisions:** The divisions are intrinsically interconnected. Starting with one set does not imply its priority.

-   **Linguistic Limitations:** His expressions, beginning with either 'x', 'y', 'z' or with 'B' & 'T', are limited and reflect the constraints of linear language and sequential thought.

-   **Implicit Oneness:** Fichte recognizes that beyond the limitations of his language, the divisions exist implicitly in perfect unity within a self-contained, singular act.

-   **Paradoxical Construction:** He acknowledges the paradox – he's attempting to conceptually 'construct' that which, by its very nature, defies sequential, discursive construction and must be grasped intuitively.

-   **Nature of the 'Single Stroke':** Is this 'single stroke' a temporal event or a structural characteristic of the absolute? How can it hold both division and oneness simultaneously?

-   **Implications of Paradox:** Does this self-aware attempt to construct the 'unconstructable' have a purpose within his system? Is it a necessary stage?

-   **Experiential Access:** If discursive thought is limited, how does Fichte propose to access this implicit oneness? Is there a shift towards another mode of understanding?

```
Let me continue now to characterize the Science of Knowing
on the basis of the indicators found in comparing it
with Kantian transcendentalism, among other things,
I said that Kant very well understood A as
the link between B and T, but that he did not grasp it
in its absolute autonomy.
Instead, he made it the basic
common property and accident of three absolutes.
In this the Science of Knowing distinguishes itself from him.
Therefore this science must hold that knowing (or certainty),
as soon as we have characterized it as A,
must actually be a purely self-sustaining substance;
that we can realize it as such for ourselves;
and it is in just this realization that
the genuine realization of the science consists.
(A “genuine realization,” I say,
with which we aren't yet concerned here,
since we are still occupied with stating the simple concept,
which is not the thing itself.)
This constitutes today's thesis.
```

-   **Kant's Limitation:** While Kant understood 'A' as the link between being (B) and thinking (T), he failed to grasp it in its absolute, self-sufficient nature. Instead, Kant treated it as a shared characteristic of three more fundamental absolutes.

-   **The Distinguishing Feature:** For the Science of Knowing, 'knowing' or 'certainty' – as embodied by 'A' – must be understood as a self-sustaining substance, something graspable in its own right.

-   **Genuine Realization:** Achieving this direct understanding and realization of 'knowing' IS the primary accomplishment of the system.

-   **Provisional Concept:** Fichte cautions that he's currently operating on a conceptual level, a preliminary step towards that genuine realization.

-   **Substance & Accident:** What does Fichte mean by 'knowing' as a substance? How is this different from Kant's notion of it as an 'accident'?

-   **Nature of Realization:** What kind of 'realization' is distinct from mere conceptual understanding? Does it involve a form of direct experience?

-   **Methodological Implication:** How does this focus on realizing 'knowing' as substance shape the method of the Science of Knowing?

```
To begin with, we can demonstrate immediately that
knowing can actually appear as something standing on its own.
I ask you to look sequentially at your own inner experience:
if you remember it accurately,
you will find the object and its representation,
with all their modifications.
But now I ask further:
Do you not know in all these modifications;
and is not your knowing, as knowing,
the same self-identical knowing
in all variations of the object?
As surely as you say, “Yes,” to this inquiry
(which you will certainly do if you have carried out the given task),
so surely will knowledge manifest
and present itself to you (as = A)
whatever the variation of its objects
(and hence in total abstraction from objectivity);
remaining as (= A); and thus as a substantive,
as staying the same as itself through all change in its object;
and thus as oneness, qualitatively changeless in itself.
This was the first point.
```

-   **Direct Experience:** Fichte moves away from abstract theorizing and invites you to observe your own inner experience.

-   **Introspection:** He asks you to analyze any instance of 'knowing,' recognizing both the object of knowing and the act of knowing itself.

-   **Constant Knowing:** He suggests that despite variation in objects, the underlying act of 'knowing' remains self-identical and constant.

-   **'Knowing' as Substantive:** If you concur with his observation, it reveals that 'knowing', embodied by 'A', persists in its own right, independently of specific objects, demonstrating a self-sustaining, substantive nature.

-   **Qualitative Unchangeability:** 'Knowing' or 'A' stands as qualitatively unchanging through changing objects and thus as a fundamental oneness.

-   **Validity of Introspection:** Does this rely on accurate and unbiased self-observation? Can everyone successfully perform this introspective task?

-   **Is 'Knowing' an Object?:** While focusing on the act of 'knowing', does he inadvertently turn it into an object for further observation?

-   **Implications of Unchangeability:** If 'knowing' is qualitatively unchanging, how does it relate to the multiplicity and change within our experience?

```
Thus it presents itself to you with impressive,
absolutely irrefutable manifestness.
You understand it so certainly that you say:
“It is absolutely thus, I cannot conceive it differently.”
And if you were asked for reasons,
you could refuse the request
and still not give up this contention.
It is manifest to you as absolutely certain.
During all possible variation in the object, you have said,
knowing always remains self-identical.
Have you then run through and exhausted
all possible changes in object,
testing in each case whether knowing remains the same?
I do not think so, because how could you have done it?
Therefore, this knowing manifests itself
independently of such experiments
and completely a priori as
self-sustaining and self-identical
independent from all subjectivity and objectivity.
```

-   **Irrefutable Manifestness:** He asserts the experience of 'knowing' as undeniable and self-validating. It presents itself with complete certainty, beyond the need for external justification.

-   **Refusing Reasons:** The certainty of this experience is such that even if asked for 'reasons', one could refuse while still maintaining complete confidence in it.

-   **Beyond Experimentation:** The constancy of 'knowing' amidst the variation in objects is not arrived at through exhaustive testing of all possibilities. It's a direct insight, independent of empirical processes.

-   **A Priori Knowing:** This understanding arises as absolutely self-sustaining, self-identical, and independent of both subjective and objective factors.

-   **Universality of Experience:** Is Fichte assuming everyone has this direct, a priori experience of 'knowing'? What if someone finds it elusive?

-   **Subjectivity's Role:** While emphasizing its independence from subjectivity, is this introspective act itself entirely free from individual biases?

-   **Source of Certainty:** What is the basis of this absolute certainty regarding the nature of 'knowing'? Is it purely intuitive?

```
Now, note what actually belongs to
this substantial knowing, so conceived,
and do so with the deepest sincerity of self-consciousness,
so that the erroneous view of the Science of Knowing
which was criticized at the end of our first lecture,
namely that it locates the Absolute in the knowing which
stands over against its object, doesn't arise again here.
It is true that in our experiment
we have started with this consciousness
or presentation of an object. T.B.-T.B. and so on.
In this part of the experiment,
B made the T different in every new moment,
because the T was altogether nothing else than
the T for this B, and disappears with it.
Now when we raised ourselves to the second part by asking,
“Is not knowing one and the same through out?”
and finding it to be so, we raised ourselves above all
differences of T as well as of B.
```

-   **Avoiding Confusion:** He warns against the misconception that the Science of Knowing places the absolute in the ordinary act of 'knowing' with its object-oriented structure (the knowing in relation to the known).

-   **Methodological Clarification:** While the introspective experiment started with examining such acts of 'knowing', it was merely a starting point.

-   **Transcendence:** The crucial insight about the self-identical, self-sustaining nature of 'knowing' transcends both the specificities of 'B' (being) and 'T' (thinking), and thus transcends the object-oriented consciousness.

-   **Beyond Divisions:** The focus is no longer on how 'B' changes 'T', but on the underlying 'knowing' that remains constant amidst these variations, moving beyond the divisions within the absolute.

-   **Paradox of Self-Consciousness:** How does introspection help understand a form of 'knowing' that ultimately transcends subject/object based knowing?

-   **Methodological Progression:** Does the Science of Knowing fully leave behind this initial stage, or is there a dialectical relationship?

-   **Nature of 'Substance':** What exactly is meant by 'substantial knowing'? Does it refer to a specific faculty of our minds or a more fundamental ontological principle?

```
Therefore we could express ourselves
much more accurately and precisely:
knowing, which for this reason is not subjective,
is absolutely unalterable and self-identical
not just independently from all variability of the object,
but also independently from all variability of the subject
without which the object doesn't exist.
The changeable is nothing further,
neither the object nor the subject,
but just the mere pure changeable, and nothing else.
Now this changeable in its continuing changeability,
which is itself unchangeable, divides itself into subject and object;
and the purely unchangeable, in which the division of subject and
object falls away, as does change, opposes itself to the changeable.
```

-   **Non-Subjective Knowing:** He emphasizes that the self-identical 'knowing' he's discussing is not subjective, transcending even variations within the perceiving subject.

-   **Absoluteness:** This 'knowing' is absolutely unchangeable, not only independent of objective differences but also independent of changes in the subject that normally experiences those objects.

-   **The Nature of Change:** Both subject and object are seen as manifestations of a fundamental, underlying change or flux.

-   **The Unchangeable:** The absolutely unchanging 'knowing' exists in contrast to this fundamental change, and transcends the divisions it creates (subject/object).

-   **Changeable vs. Unchangeable:** What is the nature of the 'pure changeable' and how does it relate to the 'unchangeable knowing'?

-   **Source of Division:** How does the unchanging ground of 'knowing' give rise to the division into subject and object? Is it an inherent property?

-   **Implications:** If subject/object are products of change, how does Fichte account for our everyday experience structured around them?

```
Result: knowing, in the mentioned meaning as A, has actually appeared
to us as self-sufficient, as independent of all changeability,
and as self-same and self-contained oneness, as was presupposed by
previous historical reports of the Science of Knowing.
We therefore already seem to have realized
the principle of the Science of Knowing in ourselves
and to have penetrated into it.
```

-   **Knowing as 'A':** Through direct experience, 'knowing' as embodied by 'A', has revealed its self-sufficiency, its independence from change, and its essential oneness.

-   **Alignment with Historical Reports:** This realization aligns with the previously mentioned characteristics of the Science of Knowing, suggesting they weren't merely abstract claims.

-   **Successful Realization:** It seems a direct, internal realization of the principle of the Science of Knowing has been achieved.

-   **'Seem' vs. Definitive Conclusion:** Why does Fichte use the tentative term 'seem'? Is there something preliminary about this realization?

-   **Experiential Basis:** Is this self-evident experience sufficient to ground the entire system, or are further steps required?

-   **Implications for Understanding:** How does this realization of the principle shape what comes next in the construction of the system?

```
The second advance in today's lecture is this.
We only seem to have done this, but this is an empty seeming.
We see merely that it is so, but we do not see into
what it authentically is as this qualitative oneness.
Precisely because we see into only such a that,
we are trapped in a disjunction and thus in two absolutes,
changeability and unchangingness, to which we
might possibly append a third, the undiscoverable root of both,
and thus end up in the same shape as Kant's philosophy.
The ground of this duality, insurmountable in this way,
is as follows: the 'that' must seem self-creating,
just as our recent insight seemed to be.
But this appearance is possible only under the condition
that a point of origin appears,
which seems (as opposed to this self-creation) to be produced by us,
just as the first part of our previously conducted experiment
actually and in fact appeared to be.
```

-   **Limited Realization:** The initial realization of 'knowing' as 'A' is incomplete. While experientially grasping its self-sufficiency ('that' it is so), its true inner nature ('what' it is) remains opaque.

-   **The Trap of Disjunction:** This limited understanding leads to a duality between the 'changeable' and 'unchangeable', reminiscent of Kant's system, with the risk of an unknowable third absolute (the root of both).

-   **The Illusion of Self-Creation:** The direct experience of 'that' can create the illusion it's self-generated. However, this illusion requires the assumption of a starting point, which seems 'produced' by us.

-   **Source of Limitation:** Why does the seemingly self-evident experience of 'knowing' not reveal its inner nature?

-   **Paradox of Starting Point:** How can something self-sustaining create the illusion of having a starting point produced by us?

-   **Progression of the System:** How does Fichte propose to overcome this limitation and achieve a genuine understanding of 'knowing's true nature?

```
In a word, we grasp both changeability and unchangingness equally,
and are inwardly torn into two or three immediate terms.
How then is this to be?
Obviously, it is clear without any further steps both that
one of the two would have to be grasped mediately,
and that this term which is grasped mediately
cannot be unchangingness,
which as the absolute can only be realized absolutely,
but rather must be changeability.
The unchangeable would have to be intuited not only in its being,
which we have already done, but instead it would have
to be penetrated in its essence, its one absolute quality.
It (the unchangeable) would have to be worked through in such a way
that changeability would be seen as necessarily proceeding from it
and as mediately graspable only by means of it.
```

-   **The Duality:** The problem lies in grasping both 'changeability' and 'unchangingness' with equal immediacy, leading to an internal division and a sense of being trapped.

-   **Mediation Required:** One of the two elements, he argues, must be grasped mediately (through another concept) rather than with immediate self-evidence.

-   **Immediacy of the Unchanging:** The 'unchangeable', as the absolute foundation, can only be realized absolutely and immediately.

-   **Mediating the Changeable:** Therefore, it's 'changeability' that must be grasped mediately and derivatively.

-   **The Task Ahead:** The 'unchangeable' must not only be intuited in its being ('that') but penetrated in its essence ('what'). This would allow 'changeability' to be grasped as necessarily arising from the unchangeable.

-   **Shift in Approach:** How will this 'working through' of the unchangeable be achieved? Is it a purely conceptual process or does it involve another mode of understanding?

-   **Nature of Derivability:** How can 'changeability' be derived from that which is, by definition, 'unchangeable'? Does this imply a dynamic process within the absolute?

-   **Implications for System:** How would successfully grasping this connection transform the previous understanding of the Science of Knowing?

```
The insight that knowing is a
self-sustaining qualitative oneness
(an insight which is purely provisional
and belongs to a theory of the Science of Knowing)
leads to the question,
“What is it [i.e., knowing] in this qualitative oneness?”
The true nature of the Science of Knowing
resides in answering this question.
In order to analyze this even further, it is clear that
for this purpose one must inwardly construct this essence of knowing.
Or, as in this case is exactly the same thing,
this essence must construct itself.
```

-   **Starting Point:** The provisional, experiential insight into 'knowing' as a self-sustaining, qualitative oneness serves as the starting point.

-   **The Central Question:** The focus shifts to penetrating the true essence of 'knowing': "What is it \[knowing\] in this qualitative oneness?" This question is the driving force of the Science of Knowing.

-   **Internal Construction:** Understanding this essence isn't about external analysis but a process of internal construction.

-   **Self-Construction of Essence:** Crucially, this 'essence' is dynamic and self-constructing. It's not a static object of study but a generative process that must unfold.

-   **Nature of Construction:** What does this 'inner construction of essence' involve? Is it a purely conceptual process, or does it hint at a different kind of insight?

-   **Paradox of Self-Creation:** How can the 'essence of knowing' construct itself? Does this point towards a self-grounding principle?

-   **Shift in Focus:** Does this move away from the previous emphasis on direct experience? If so, how are the two approaches reconciled?

```
In this constructive act, it is without any
doubt and is what it is as existing;
and, as existing, it is what it is.
Therefore it is clear that the Science of Knowing and
the knowing that presents itself in its essential oneness
are entirely one and the same;
that the Science of Knowing and primordially essential knowing
merge reciprocally into one another and permeate each other;
that in themselves they are not different;
and that the difference which we still make here is
only a verbal difference of the exact kind
mentioned at the start of this lecture.
The primordially essential knowing is constructive,
thus intrinsically genetic;
this would be the original knowing or certainty in itself.
Manifestness in itself is therefore genetic.
```

-   **Identity of Knowing:** The creative act involved in constructing the Science of Knowing is indistinguishable from the essential oneness of 'knowing' itself.

-   **Mutual Interpenetration:** Primordial knowing and the Science of Knowing are not separate entities but merge seamlessly into each other.

-   **The Difference is Verbal:** Any distinction drawn between them is merely a matter of linguistic convention, not an ontological difference.

-   **Geneticism:** The essence of knowing is revealed to be constructive and genetic. This implies a dynamic, self-generative process at the core.

-   **Manifestness is Genetic:** Therefore, the self-evident character of knowing is not a static quality but intimately related to this generative process.

-   **Paradox of Genesis:** How can something that is absolute and foundational be simultaneously self-generative?

-   **Implications of Identity:** If 'knowing' and the construction of the system are unified, does this give the system a self-validating character?

-   **Nature of the 'Genetic':** What is the nature of this generative act? Is it temporal, or an ongoing, internal characteristic?

```
And with this we have specified the deepest characteristic difference
demarcating the Science of Knowing from all other philosophies,
particularly from the most similar, the Kantian.
```

-   **Primacy of Genesis:** He emphasizes the focus on the dynamic, generative nature of 'knowing' as the most fundamental distinguishing feature of his system.

**Connections to Previous Discussions:**

-   **Kantian Departure:** This definitively establishes the Science of Knowing as moving beyond Kantian Critical Philosophy, even though it shares a transcendental focus.
-   **Foundation as Process:** It suggests that understanding the generative process of 'knowing' is essential to grasping Fichte's system.

```
All philosophy should terminate in knowing in and for itself.
Knowing, or manifestness in and for itself, is actively genetic.
The highest appearance of knowing,
which no longer expresses its inner essence
but instead just its external existence, is factical;
and since it is still the appearance of knowing,
factical manifestness.
All factical manifestness, even if it is the absolute,
remains something objective, alien, self-constructing
but not constructed of knowing,
and therefore something inwardly unexplained,
which an exhausted speculation,
skeptical of its own power, calls inexplicable.
Kantian speculation ends at its highest point
with factical manifestness:
the insight that at the basis of both
the sensible and supersensible worlds,
there must be a principle of connection,
thus a thoroughly genetic principle
which creates and determines both worlds absolutely.
```

-   **Aim of Philosophy:** True philosophy should culminate in the understanding of 'knowing in and for itself'.

-   **Genesis as Essence:** This knowing is, in its essence, dynamically generative and self-constructing.

-   **The Limits of Facticity:** The highest form of this 'knowing' that doesn't fully express its inner essence merely appears as objective fact. This 'factical manifestness' remains unexplained and inexplicable within systems that don't grasp its generative source.

-   **Kant's Limitation:** Kantian philosophy, while recognizing the need for a genetic principle unifying the sensible and supersensible realms, ultimately stops at 'factical manifestness' and fails to penetrate the true nature of this genesis.

-   **Nature of the 'Factical':** What exactly is meant by 'factical manifestness'? Does it refer to empirical facts, or something broader?

-   **'Unexplained' vs. 'Inexplicable':** What's the distinction between something that remains currently unexplained due to incomplete understanding, versus something inherently inexplicable?

-   **Beyond Kant:** How does Fichte propose to go beyond this Kantian limitation and illuminate the genetic principle at work?

```
This insight, which is completely right in itself,
could occur to Kant only as a result of his reason's absolute,
but unconsciously operative law:
that it [that is, his reason] come to a stop
only with absolute oneness,
recognize only this as absolutely substantial,
and derive everything changeable from this one.
This basic law of oneness remains only factical for him,
and therefore its object is unexamined,
because he allows it to work on him only mechanically;
but he does not bring this action itself
and its law into his awareness anew.
If he did so, pure light would dawn on him
and he would come to the Science of Knowing.
Kantian factical manifestness is not even the highest kind,
because he lets its object emerge from two related terms
and does not grasp it as we have grasped the highest factical object,
namely as pure knowing;
instead he grasps it with the qualification that
it is the link between the sensible and supersensible worlds.
That is, he does not grasp it inwardly
and in itself as oneness, but as duality;
his highest principle is a synthesis post factum.
Namely, this means a case when by self-observation one discovers
in one's consciousness two terms of a disjunction and,
compelled by reason, sees that they must intrinsically be one,
disregarding the fact that one cannot say how, given this oneness,
they can likewise become two.
```

-   **Kant's Insight and Limitation:** Fichte acknowledges Kant's correct intuition that the absolute must be a fundamental unity from which all change is derived. However, this remains merely 'factical' for Kant due to his unconscious reliance on this principle.

-   **Mechanical vs. Self-Aware:** Kant doesn't examine this principle of unity, allowing it to operate "mechanically" without bringing this operation itself into conscious awareness.

-   **Science of Knowing's Breakthrough:** Doing so, Fichte argues, is the crucial step that would lead to the Science of Knowing and a genuine understanding of the 'pure light' of absolute knowing.

-   **Kant's Dualistic Limitation:** Kant's highest principle, while recognizing the need for unification, remains dualistic (sensible vs. supersensible), a synthesis imposed after the fact. He doesn't grasp the absolute directly in its pure oneness.

-   **The Disjunction Problem:** Kant cannot explain how, given this fundamental unity, the appearance of a duality arises.

-   **Fichte's Interpretation of Kant:** Do you think Fichte's assessment of Kant's limitations is accurate and fair? Could there be alternative interpretations?

-   **Nature of 'Unconscious' Operation:** What does Fichte mean when he says Kant relies on the principle of unity unconsciously?

-   **Methodological Shift:** How would bringing this principle into 'conscious awareness', as Fichte proposes, fundamentally change philosophical inquiry?

```
Briefly, this is exactly the same procedure
by which in our first lecture
we rose from the discovery of
the duality of being and thinking
to A as their required necessary connection,
in order initially to construct for ourselves
the transcendentalism common to
the Science of Knowing and Kantianism,
but the matter was not to rest there.
Additionally there should be a synthesis a priori
which is equally an analysis,
since it simultaneously provides
the basis for both oneness and duality.
Kant's highest manifestness, I said, is factical,
and not even the highest factical kind.
```

-   **Shared Starting Point:** Both Fichte and Kant begin with an initial recognition of an apparent duality (being and thinking in Fichte's case). This forms a common ground for transcendentalism in both systems.

-   **Going Beyond Duality:** In Fichte's system, there's a conscious movement towards understanding the underlying unity ('A') from which the duality arises.

-   **Synthesis and Analysis:** For Fichte, this involves a synthesis a priori (a unifying understanding achieved through reason) that simultaneously acts as an analysis, explaining the relationship between the duality and its underlying unity.

-   **Kant's Facticity:** Kant's highest principle, while recognizing the need for unification, remains 'factical' - a given fact without genuine understanding of its generative source.

-   **Methodological Progression:** In Fichte's system, how does the understanding of 'A' and the analysis of its relationship to the duality differ from Kant's treatment of a unifying principle?

-   **Implications:** What implications does this difference have for understanding the nature of reality within each respective system?

```
The highest factical manifestness has been presented today:
the insight into knowing's absolute self-sufficiency,
without any determination by anything outside itself,
anything changeable.
This is contrary to the Kantian absolute,
which is determined by the transition
between the sensible and supersensible.
Since now this presently factical element in science
is itself to become actively genetic and developing,
then, change in general will be grounded in it
as a genesis pure and simple.
```

-   **Highest Facticity Transcended:** The highest 'factical' point – understanding 'knowing' as absolutely self-sufficient – is no longer a static end but a starting point for further development.

-   **Contrast with Kant:** Fichte's understanding of the absolute isn't dependent on a transition between realms (sensible/supersensible) as in Kant's philosophy.

-   **From Facticity to Genesis:** The 'factical' insight into 'knowing' must now become dynamic, self-constructing. This will reveal it as a purely genetic principle.

-   **Grounding Change:** This transformation will allow for explaining change in its entirety as arising from a fundamental, dynamic genesis.

-   **Nature of Transformation:** How does the shift from a 'factical' understanding to an 'actively genetic' one take place? What methodological changes are required?

-   **Genesis of Change:** How does 'knowing' as a generative principle give rise to the experience of change and the multiplicity of the world?

-   **Idealist Implications:** Does grounding change in a self-constructing 'knowing' imply the world is ultimately created by mind?

```
But by no means will any particular change be so grounded.
It seems that absolute facticity could be discovered only
by those who have raised themselves above all facticity,
as I have actually discovered it
and consistently made use of it
only after discovering the true inner principle
of the Science of Knowing,
and as I am using it now to lead the audience
from that point forward in the genetic process.
Kant's manifestness is factical,
we ourselves are presently also standing in facticity;
and I add that everywhere in the scientific world
there is no other kind of manifestness except the factical
(namely in the first principles),
except in the Science of Knowing.
```

-   **No Direct Derivation of Particulars:** Understanding the fundamental, genetic principle of change doesn't automatically explain the genesis of any specific change.

-   **Path to Discovery:** The ability to arrive at the absolute 'facticity' of self-sufficient 'knowing' seems accessible only to those who have already grasped the deeper principles of the Science of Knowing.

-   **Fichte's Methodological Path:** He uses this insight not as an end goal but as a point in the genetic process to guide the audience towards a deeper understanding.

-   **Kant's Standpoint:** Kant, and most other philosophical systems, remain trapped within facticity with regards to their fundamental principles.

-   **Science of Knowing's Uniqueness:** The Science of Knowing stands alone in striving to grasp the true genetic nature of first principles.

-   **Limitations of Genesis:** If the genesis of particular changes cannot be directly derived from the foundational principle, how is the world of multiplicity understood?

-   **Methodological Progression:** What are the specific steps involved in moving beyond facticity and grasping the dynamic, generative nature of 'knowing' within Fichte's system?

-   **Implications for Other Philosophies:** Could other systems be reinterpreted to reveal a hidden, genetic aspect of their principles, or is this transformation unique to Fichte's approach?

```
Fourth Lecture
Friday, April 20, 1804
Honorable Guests:

Here are the results so far:
that we have certainly grasped knowing
as unchangeable, self-same and self-sustaining,
beyond all change and beyond the subjectivity-objectivity,
which is inseparable from change.
But this insight was not yet the Science of Knowing itself,
but rather only its premise.
The Science of Knowing must still actually construct
this inner, qualitatively unchangeable being,
and as soon as it does this,
it will simultaneously create change,
the second term, as well.
```

-   **Grasping Knowing:** The 'unchangeable, self-same, and self-sustaining' nature of 'knowing' has been grasped with certainty, transcending change and the subject/object duality.

-   **Premise, Not Conclusion:** This insight is a starting point, not the completion of the Science of Knowing.

-   **Construction and Genesis:** The Science of Knowing must actively 'construct' the inner nature of this unchanging 'knowing'. In doing so, it will unveil the simultaneous genesis of 'change' as the counterpart within the system.

-   **Dynamic Process:** What does 'constructing' this inner nature of 'knowing' entail? Is it purely conceptual, or does it involve other modes of understanding?

-   **Genesis of Change:** How can the 'unchangeable' be the source of change? Does this imply some kind of self-differentiation or division within the absolute?

-   **Implications for System:** How would successfully achieving this construction and revealing the origin of change transform the overall understanding of the Science of Knowing?

```
The true authentic meaning of this
simultaneous double construction
of the changeable and the unchangeable
will become completely clear
only when we actually and immediately
carry out the construction,
something that belongs within the sphere
of the Science of Knowing itself,
certainly not in preliminary reports.
```

-   **Understanding Through Action:** Theoretical explanations cannot fully convey the meaning of this dynamic construction. Understanding requires active participation in the process.

-   **The Scope of the Science of Knowing:** This act of construction is a central, internal process of the Science of Knowing, not something to be explained solely within preliminary discussions.

-   **Limits of Language:** Why are preliminary reports or theoretical explanations inadequate in conveying this core aspect of his system?

-   **Implications for Methodology:** What kind of shift in approach or methodology is necessary to move from theoretical discussions towards the act of 'construction'?

-   **Experiential Aspect:** Does this focus on 'construction' imply an experiential or even performative dimension to the Science of Knowing?

```
On introducing the schema:

      A
x y z • B-T

I said that the Science of Knowing stood in the point.
I have been asked whether it doesn't rather go in A.
The most exact answer is that actually and strictly
it doesn't belong in either of these
but rather in the oneness of both.
```

-   **Beyond the Schema:** Fichte emphasizes that the Science of Knowing, in its true nature, transcends the specific points or divisions within the diagram ('A', 'x y z', 'B', 'T').

-   **Dynamic Unity:** The focus is on the underlying oneness from which the divisions emerge. The Science of Knowing involves understanding this dynamic interplay of unity and division.

-   **Purpose of the Schema:** If the Science of Knowing transcends the diagram, what role does the schema play within his system? Is it a provisional tool?

-   **Nature of 'Oneness':** How does Fichte conceive of this 'oneness' that is the foundation of both 'A' and the subsequent divisions?

-   **Implications for Understanding:** How does this clarification change the way the diagram and the concepts it represents should be understood?

```
By itself A is objective and therefore inwardly dead;
it should not remain so, indeed it should become actively genetic.
The point, on the other hand, is merely genetic.
Mere genesis is nothing at all; but this is not just
mere genesis but the determinate genesis that is required by
the absolute qualitative A; [it is] a point of oneness.
```

-   **The Objectivity of 'A':** 'A', the symbol of the absolute, is considered objective and static in its isolated form.

-   **The Genetic Principle:** To overcome this limitation, 'A' must become infused with a 'genetic' principle, an active, generative quality.

-   **The Limiting Nature of Pure Genesis:** On the other hand, a merely 'genetic' point, implying pure change or process without a grounding principle, is equally insufficient.

-   **Integration Through Oneness:** The Science of Knowing requires the integration of the determinate genesis stemming from absolute 'A' into a unified point of oneness.

-   **Source of the Genetic:** How does 'A', initially considered objective, become infused with a 'genetic' quality? Is this an inherent potential or an external addition?

-   **Nature of 'Determinate Genesis':** How does the absolute nature of 'A' shape or constrain the 'genetic' process that arises from it?

-   **The Meaning of 'Point':** What does Fichte mean by a 'point of oneness'? Is it a temporal moment or a structural characteristic?

```
Now to be sure this point of oneness
can be realized immediately,
oscillating and expending itself in this point;
and we, as scientists of knowing,
are this realization inwardly
(I say inwardly and concealed from ourselves).
But this point can neither be expressed nor reconstructed
in its immediacy, since all expression or reconstruction is
conceiving and is intrinsically mediated.
It is expressed and reconstructed just as we have expressed it
at this moment: namely, that one begins from A and,
indicating that it cannot persist alone,
links it to the point;
or one begins with the point and,
indicating that it cannot persist alone,
links it to A, all the while, to be sure,
knowing, saying, and meaning that
neither A nor the point can exist by itself and
that all our talk could not express the implicit truth,
but instead that the implicitly unreconstructible something
which can only be pictured in an empty and objective image is
the organic oneness of both.
```

-   **Intuitive Realization:** The 'point of oneness', with its dynamic, self-generating nature, can be realized directly within the 'scientists of knowing'. This realization is internal and intuitive.

-   **Limitations of Expression:** This direct realization cannot be perfectly expressed or reconstructed through language or conceptualization, which are inherently mediated and sequential.

-   **Provisional Representations:** The descriptions involving 'A' and the 'point' are imperfect representations. Fichte highlights the underlying dynamic and organic oneness transcending these static concepts.

-   **Self-Awareness:** Crucially, there is a level of self-awareness acknowledging the limitations of language and the provisional nature of the conceptual description.

-   **Who are 'Scientists of Knowing':** Does this refer to those engaged in the Science of Knowing, or does it imply a specific level of philosophical insight?

-   **Nature of the 'Intuition':** What kind of intuition allows for this direct realization of the 'point of oneness'? Is it accessible to everyone?

-   **The Role of Language:** If language is inherently limiting, how does Fichte's system communicate its core principles?

```
Thus, since reconstruction is conceiving,
and since this very conceiving explicitly
abandons its own intrinsic validity,
this is precisely a case of
conceiving the inconceivable as inconceivable.
Therefore —and I put this here first as a clarification—
this is a question of the organic split into
B-T and x, y, z,
as I explained at the beginning of the last lecture;
because when I speak, I must always put one before the other.
But is it actually so?
No, instead it is exactly the same stroke;
and let me add this as well:
this deeper connection must indeed itself be a result and
a lower expression of the higher one just now described.
```

-   **Reconstruction as Conceiving:** Since reconstruction inherently involves conceptualization, it's bound to fragment the intuitive grasp of the underlying oneness.

-   **Conceiving the Inconceivable:** True understanding involves a paradox – recognizing the ultimate 'inconceivable' nature of the core principle while still attempting to approach it with the tools of reason.

-   **The Problem of Expression:** This issue is reflected in the split into 'B', 'T', and 'x, y, z', as language requires sequential presentation of these intrinsically interconnected elements.

-   **Underlying Oneness:** Despite having to put one concept before the other, Fichte emphasizes the essential oneness underlying these divisions.

-   **Hierarchical Connection:** He hints at a hierarchical relationship where the ability to conceptually represent the splits is a lower-level expression of the more fundamental ability to intuitively grasp the 'point of oneness'.

-   **Origin of the Split:** How does the 'organic split' into divisions within his system arise from the initial 'point of oneness'?

-   **Limits of Hierarchy:** If the splits are 'lower expressions', does it imply that they are less real or a form of illusion?

-   **Implications:** How does this understanding of 'conceiving the inconceivable' shape the process of constructing the Science of Knowing?

```
Finally, in order to say this in its full meaning
and thereby to make your insight into the Science of Knowing,
and into knowing as such, much clearer:
secondary knowing, or consciousness,
with its whole lawful play
by means of fixed change and the manifold
(within it or outside it),
of sensible and supersensible,
and of time and space, comes to be, in principle,
through this recently noted and demonstrated division,
taken merely as a division and nothing else.
```

-   **Secondary Knowing:** Fichte distinguishes primary knowing ('A', 'knowing as such') from 'secondary knowing', which is synonymous with ordinary consciousness.

-   **Genesis of Consciousness:** Consciousness, with its complex structures of experience (change, multiplicity, sensible/supersensible, space/time), is fundamentally derived from the division within the absolute oneness.

-   **The Division as Foundation:** The split within the absolute, when considered purely as a division, forms the ground for the emergence of consciousness and its attendant structures.

-   **Mechanism of Derivation:** How exactly does the division within 'A' give rise to the complexities of consciousness and the structures of our experience?

-   **Nature of Consciousness:** Is consciousness fundamentally an illusion arising from the division, or does it have its own ontological reality?

-   **Implications for Understanding:** How does this explanation reshape one's understanding of consciousness and the world of experience?

```
Everything we attribute to the subject,
as originating from it, derives from this.
Because it is clear without further ado
that from a particular perspective,
namely the Science of Knowing's synthetic perspective,
the disjunction must be just as absolute as oneness;
otherwise we would be stuck in oneness
and would never get outside it to changeability.
(Let me note in passing that this is
an important characteristic of the Science of Knowing
and distinguishes it from Spinoza's system,
which also wants absolute oneness
but does not know how to make a bridge from it to the manifold;
and, on the other hand, if it has the manifold,
cannot get from there to oneness.)
```

-   **Subjectivity's Source:** Actions or qualities attributed to the subject ultimately arise from the fundamental split within the absolute.

-   **Necessity of Disjunction:** For the Science of Knowing to fully account for the world of change and multiplicity, the 'disjunction' must hold equal weight with the absolute 'oneness'.

-   **Avoiding Static Oneness:** A system that merely emphasizes an absolute oneness fails to explain the transition to multiplicity, thus remaining stuck in a static concept.

-   **Critique of Spinoza:** Fichte uses Spinoza as an example, arguing that his system either focuses exclusively on oneness or posits a multiplicity that it cannot reconcile with its absolute foundation.

-   **Specificity of Subjectivity:** How does the abstract concept of 'disjunction' relate to the specific structures and experiences associated with subjectivity?

-   **Nature of Change:** Does the 'disjunction' imply a disruption within the absolute or an inherent potential for multiplicity within its unity?

-   **Implications of Critique:** How does Fichte propose his system overcomes the limitations he identifies in Spinoza's philosophy?

```
As scientists of knowing, we never escape
the principle of division inwardly and empirically
(by means of what we do and promote);
but we certainly escape it intellectually
with regard to what is valid in itself,
in which very regard the principle of division
surrenders and negates itself.
```

-   **Empirical Level:** At the level of active engagement with the system ('scientists of knowing'), the principle of division remains operative, shaping experience.

-   **Intelligible Level:** At a deeper theoretical level, focused on the essential nature of reality ('what is valid in itself'), the division is transcended by a more fundamental understanding.

-   **Self-Negation of Division:** The division, in the process of being understood intellectually, reveals its own limited nature and ultimately gives way to a higher understanding.

-   **Nature of the 'Intelligible':** What is meant by the realm of 'what is valid in itself'? Does it refer to a more abstract metaphysical level, or something else?

-   **Paradox of Transcendence:** How can the Science of Knowing simultaneously operate within the principle of division and transcend it?

-   **Implications for Methodology:** How does this dual perspective necessitate a shift in methods between the empirical and theoretical levels of the system?

```
Manifestly in our construction
by means of the principle of division,
it stands in the place not of that which is to be
valid to the extent it is constructed
but of that which is intrinsically valid;
thus it stands wholly autonomously, as has been said,
between the two principles of oneness and separation,
simultaneously annulling both and positing both.
```

-   **Provisional Nature of Division:** In the construction process, the 'principle of division' serves as a tool but does not represent the ultimate reality ('that which is intrinsically valid').

-   **Autonomous Position:** The 'principle of division' operates between the poles of absolute oneness and separation. It holds a unique position within the system.

-   **Dual Action:** It acts by simultaneously 'annulling' both oneness and separation while also 'positing' them. This seemingly paradoxical action points to its dynamic, generative function.

-   **Nature of 'Intrinsic Validity':** What kind of reality is represented by 'that which is intrinsically valid'? Is it a static principle or dynamic process?

-   **Mechanism of Annulling/Positing:** How does the principle of division achieve this dual function? Does it imply a negation and subsequent synthesis?

-   **Implications for System:** How does this unique, dynamic role of the 'principle of division' shape the overall structure and progression of the Science of Knowing?

```
Thus, the standpoint of the Science of Knowing,
which stands still in consciousness,
is by no means a synthesis post factum;
but instead a synthesis a priori,
taking neither division nor oneness as given,
but creating both at one stroke.
Once again to adduce an even higher perspective
what is the absolute oneness of the Science of Knowing?
Neither A nor the point,
but instead the inner organic oneness of both.
Besides this given description of the point of oneness
is there also another?
None at all, we have seen.
Therefore, this description is the original
and absolutely authentic one.
What are its constituents?
The organic oneness of both is
a construction or a concept,
and indeed the single absolute concept,
abstracted from nothing existing,
since even its own separate existence,
and hence the existence of everything conceptual,
is denied.
```

-   **Fichte's Standpoint:** The Science of Knowing involves a 'standpoint' within consciousness that is not a retrospective synthesis of existing elements.

-   **A Priori Synthesis:** It is a generative synthesis a priori that creates both oneness and division simultaneously, transcending a reliance on given, static concepts.

-   **Organic Oneness:** The absolute oneness of the Science of Knowing is neither purely 'A' nor the 'point', but their dynamic, organic unity.

-   **Uniqueness of Description:** The description of this 'point of oneness' is the only possible, original, and authentic one, as it cannot be derived from external concepts.

-   **Constituents of the Description:** The 'organic oneness' is itself a construction, the fundamental concept within the system, abstracted from any external referent and acknowledging its own conceptual nature.

-   **Meaning of 'Consciousness':** What does Fichte specifically mean by 'consciousness' in this context? Is it merely ordinary awareness?

-   **Paradox in Description:** How can the 'absolutely authentic' description rely on a 'construction' that denies its own separate reality?

-   **Implications for System:** How does the understanding of this foundational concept shape the overall progression and internal logic of the Science of Knowing?

Further, the construction as such is denied by the manifestness of what exists autonomously; thus even the inconceivable, as the inconceivable and nothing more, is posited by this manifestness, posited through the negation of the absolute concept, which must be posited just so that it can be annulled.

-   **Denial of the Construction:** The very act of constructing the concept of 'organic oneness' is ultimately negated by the direct experience of the autonomous reality.

-   **Positing the Inconceivable:** The 'inconceivable' nature of this reality is acknowledged precisely through its resistance to conceptualization.

-   **Necessity of the Concept:** The 'absolute concept' must be initially posited within the system to be subsequently negated, allowing for the recognition of that which transcends conceptualization.

-   **Nature of 'Manifestness':** What does Fichte mean by the 'manifestness of what exists autonomously'? Does it refer to a specific experience or a more fundamental ontological principle?

-   **Paradox of Negation:** How does the negation of the 'absolute concept' lead to a position of the 'inconceivable'? Does this imply a form of negative knowledge?

-   **Purpose of the Concept:** What function does the initial construction and subsequent negation of the 'absolute concept' serve within the system?

```
And so:

1. the necessary unification and indivisibility
of the concept and the inconceivable is clearly seen into,
and the result may be expressed thus:
if the absolutely inconceivable is to be
manifest as solely self-sustaining,
then the concept must be annulled,
but to be annulled, it must be posited,
because the inconceivable becomes manifest
only with the negation of the concept.
Supplement: hence inconceivable = unchangeable; concept = change.
Therefore along with the foregoing it is evident that
if the unchangeable is to appear, there must be change.
```

-   **Unified Conceptuality:** The 'concept' and the 'inconceivable' are necessarily intertwined. To manifest the 'inconceivable', the concept must be posited and then negated.

-   **Formula:**

-   The 'inconceivable' manifests as self-sustaining through the annulment of the concept.

-   The concept must be posited for this annulment to occur.

-   The 'inconceivable' is revealed through this negation of the concept.

-   **Supplement:** Fichte equates the 'inconceivable' with the 'unchangeable' and the 'concept' with 'change'. He concludes that for the 'unchangeable' to appear, 'change' is necessary.

-   **Nature of Necessity:** Why is this interplay of the 'concept' and 'inconceivable' necessary? Is it grounded in an ontological principle?

-   **Paradox of Manifestation:** How can the 'inconceivable' become 'manifest' even through the act of negating the concept?

-   **Implications of Supplement:** How does this equation of the 'unchangeable' with the 'inconceivable' and 'change' with the 'concept' shape further development of the system?

```
2. Now to be sure inconceivability is only
the negation of the concept, an expression of its annulment.
Therefore it is something which originates
from both the concept and knowing themselves;
it is a quality transferred by means of absolute manifestness.
Noting this, and therefore abstracting from this quality,
nothing remains for oneness except absoluteness
or pure self-sufficiency in itself.
```

-   **'Inconceivable' as Negation:** The 'inconceivable' is primarily a negative concept. It represents the absence or annulment of conceptualization.

-   **Origin in the System:** The 'inconceivable' arises from the interaction between the 'concept' and 'knowing' themselves, making it a product of the system.

-   **Transferred Quality:** The 'inconceivable' is a quality projected onto the underlying reality by means of 'absolute manifestness' (the direct experience of autonomous existence).

-   **Abstraction from the Quality:** When the quality of the 'inconceivable' is disregarded, the fundamental aspect of absolute oneness is its pure self-sufficiency.

-   **Nature of 'Knowing'**: What is meant by 'knowing' in this context? Is it a faculty, a process, or something else?

-   **Implications of Abstraction:** How does abstracting from the 'inconceivable' alter the understanding of absolute oneness?

-   **Purpose of the 'Inconceivable'**: Why does Fichte emphasize the relative and constructed nature of the 'inconceivable' within his system?

```
3. The following consideration makes this
particularly important and relevant:
What is pure self-sufficient knowing in itself?
The Science of Knowing has to answer this question,
or, as we put it more precisely,
it has to construct the presupposed inner quality of knowing.
We are undertaking this construction here:
negating the concept by means of manifestness,
and thus the self-creation of inconceivability is
this living construction of knowing's inner quality.
This inconceivability itself originates in the concept
and in pure immediate manifestness;
likewise the whole quality of the absolute,
as well as the fact that a quality can be applied to it at all,
originates in the concept.
The absolute is not intrinsically inconceivable,
since this makes no sense;
it is inconceivable only when the concept itself tries for it,
and this inconceivability is its only property.
Having recognized this inconceivability as
an alien quality introduced by knowing, I said before,
only pure self-sufficiency, or substantiality,
remains in the absolute;
and it is quite true that at best this
self-sufficiency does not originate in the concept,
since it enters only with the latter's annulling.
```

-   **Central Question:** The central aim of the Science of Knowing is to grasp and construct the inner nature of 'pure knowing in itself'.

-   **Method: Constructing 'Inconceivability'**: The process of actively negating the concept through 'manifestness' is a pivotal step in constructing the 'inconceivable' aspect of knowing's inner quality.

-   **The Concept's Role:** Both the quality of 'inconceivability' and the notion of the absolute having any qualities at all are concepts introduced within the system.

-   **The Absolute's Nature:** The absolute isn't inherently 'inconceivable'. It becomes so when the concept attempts to grasp it. This 'inconceivability' is its only discernible property.

-   **Self-Sufficiency:** With the 'inconceivable' recognized as a quality imposed by 'knowing', the inherent nature of the absolute is its pure self-sufficiency, which exists independently of the concept.

-   **Paradox of Construction:** How can the 'inner quality of 'knowing' be constructed if it's ultimately 'inconceivable'?

-   **Nature of 'Manifestness':** What kind of 'manifestness' allows for the negation of the concept and the experience of the 'inconceivable'?

-   **Implications of Self-Sufficiency:** How does the understanding of the absolute's pure self-sufficiency shape the further development of the system?

```
But it is clear that this quality enters only
within immediate manifestness, within intuition,
and thus is only the representative
and correlate of pure light.
This latter is its genetic principle by which,
first of all, according to our hypothesis
all manifestness  opens up into genetic manifestness,
since pure light manifests itself implicitly as genesis.
Secondly, the previously presented relationship of
concept to being and vice versa is further determined as follows:
If there is to be an expression
and realization of the absolute light,
then the concept must be posited,
so that it can be negated by the immediate light,
since the expression of pure light consists just in this negation.
But the result of this expression is being in itself, period.
[This result] is inconceivable precisely because
pure light is simultaneously destruction of the concept.
Thus, pure light has prevailed as the one focus and
the sole principle of both being and the concept.
```

-   **Self-Sufficiency and 'Pure Light':** The absolute's self-sufficiency finds its correlate and representation in 'pure light' experienced through 'intuition'.

-   **'Pure Light' as Genesis:** 'Pure light' is the fundamental genetic principle. It manifests as a self-generative process, opening up all 'manifestness' to be understood in genetic terms.

-   **Concept-Being Relationship:** For 'pure light' to be expressed or realized, the concept must be posited and then subsequently negated by the immediacy of 'pure light'. The result is 'being in itself'.

-   **'Inconceivable' as a Result:** 'Being in itself' is 'inconceivable' as a consequence of this negation of the concept by 'pure light'.

-   **'Pure Light' as Prevailing Principle:** Ultimately, 'pure light' acts as the fundamental principle unifying and giving rise to both being and the concept.

-   **Nature of 'Pure Light':** What is the ontological status of 'pure light'? Is it a metaphor, a fundamental principle, or a type of experience?

-   **Paradox of Expression:** How can 'pure light', associated with the negation of concepts, find expression within the system?

-   **Implications for Understanding:** How does the introduction of 'pure light' transform the understanding of being and the concept within Fichte's system?

```
4. From the preceding it follows that this inconceivable,
as the bearer of all reality in knowing,
which we grasp in its principle,
is absolute only as inconceivable,
and cannot be thought in any other way.
No other additional hidden qualities are attributable to it.
Just as little can any quality be added to light,
beyond the previously mentioned characteristic,
namely that it annuls the concept and remains absolute being.
If we made such additions, we would,
as Kant has been criticized for doing,
run up against something unexplained and perhaps inexplicable.
As support for this contention,
notice that we have understood it as inconceivable
purely in its form and nothing more.
We have no right to assert anything before
we have seen into it.
```

-   **The 'Inconceivable' as Absolute:** The 'inconceivable' is absolute only within its own terms, as the 'bearer of all reality in knowing' that cannot be grasped conceptually.

-   **Limitation of Understanding:** No hidden qualities should be attributed to the 'inconceivable' as this could lead to unexplained, potentially 'inexplicable' elements within the system.

-   **Analogy with Light:** Similarly, 'pure light' should only be understood in terms of its function within the system: annulling the concept and revealing itself as absolute being.

-   **Critiquing Kant:** Fichte uses this point to critique Kant's system, suggesting he introduces unexplained elements.

-   **Understanding and Form:** Fichte emphasizes that understanding the 'inconceivable' is limited to its form (its function within the system). Direct insight into its content is not yet claimed.

-   **Purpose of Limitation:** Why does Fichte insist on this strict limitation in understanding the 'inconceivable' at this stage?

-   **Methodological Implication:** How does this focus on form shape the process of constructing the Science of Knowing?

-   **Avoiding 'Inexplicable':** How does attributing qualities to the 'inconceivable' lead to 'inexplicable' elements?

```
So if we posit some other hidden quality,
we have either invented it, or better,
since pure invention from nothing is completely impossible,
we have manufactured it by trying to supply
a principle for some facticity.
This happened with Kant when he first factically discovered
the distinction between the sensible and supersensible worlds
and then added to his absolute the additional inexplicable
quality of linking the two worlds,
a move which pushed us back from genetic manifestness
into merely factical manifestness,
completely contravening the inner spirit of
the Science of Knowing.
Therefore, it is important to note that
whatever yet to be determined characteristics
the reality appearing in our knowing may carry in itself,
besides the common basic property of inconceivability,
such characteristics by no means require any new
absolute grounding principle besides the one principle of pure light,
since this would multiply the number of absolutes.
Rather, the multiplicity and change of these various traits is
to be deduced purely from the interaction of the light with itself,
in its multifarious relations to concepts,
and to inconceivable being.
```

-   **Dangers of Hidden Qualities:** Fichte cautions against attributing hidden qualities to the 'inconceivable' or 'pure light', emphasizing that such qualities would either be invented or introduced in an attempt to explain observed phenomena (facticity).
-   **Kant's Error:** Fichte uses Kant as an example. He argues that Kant's system commits this error by adding an unexplained quality to the absolute to link the sensible and supersensible realms. This, for Fichte, contradicts the focus on 'genetic manifestness' at the heart of the Science of Knowing.
-   **Internal Derivation:** Fichte advocates that any additional characteristics of reality, beyond the fundamental 'inconceivability', should not require new absolute grounding principles. Instead, they should be understood as arising from the dynamic interaction of 'pure light' with itself, the concept, and 'inconceivable being'.

**Questions for Consideration:**

-   **Facticity vs. Genesis:** Could you clarify the distinction Fichte draws between 'factical manifestness' and 'genetic manifestness'?
-   **Kant's Shortcoming:** How does Kant's attempt to link the sensible/supersensible represent a failure of 'genetic' understanding?
-   **Implications:** What kind of philosophical system would result from Fichte's focus on deriving complexity from the internal dynamics of 'pure light'?

```
The focus of everything is pure light.
To truly come to this requires that
the concept be posited and annulled
and that an intrinsically inconceivable being be posited.
If it is granted that the light should exist,
then in this judgment everything else mentioned is possible as well.
We have now seen this; it is true; it remains true forever;
and it expresses the basic principle of all knowing.
We can so designate it for ourselves.
```

-   **'Pure Light' as Central:** The absolute focus is on 'pure light' as the foundational principle.

-   **Process of Understanding:** Realizing the significance of 'pure light' requires the positing and subsequent annulling of the concept, alongside the postulation of an 'inconceivable being'.

-   **Conditional Truth:** The entire process is conditional: if the existence of 'pure light' is granted, then the steps involved and the consequent understanding become possible.

-   **Enduring Truth:** Fichte asserts that this understanding is fundamentally true and will remain so. It forms a core principle for all knowing within his system.

-   **Role of the Conditional:** Why does Fichte preface this realization with "if the light should exist"? Does this imply a hypothetical aspect to his system?

-   **'Inconceivable Being':** What is the exact nature of the 'inconceivable being' and how does it relate to 'pure light'?

-   **Implications for System:** How does this core principle shape the understanding of the world and how knowledge is constructed within the Science of Knowing?

```
Now, however, I want to completely ignore
the content of this insight and reflect on its form,
on our actual situation of insight.
I also think that we, those of us present here
who have actually seen it,
are the ones who had the insight.
As I remember it and as I think we all do,
the process was that we freely constructed the concepts
and premisses with which we began,
that we held them up to each other freely,
and that in holding them together
we were gripped by the conviction that they
belonged together absolutely and formed an indivisible oneness.
Thus we created at least the conditions for
the self-manifesting insight,
and so we likewise appeared to ourselves unconditionally.
```

-   **Shift in Focus:** Fichte momentarily sets aside the specific understanding attained to examine the process that led to it. This highlights his emphasis on the methodology of knowing.

-   **Collective Insight:** Fichte acknowledges the collective experience of shared insight among those present, emphasizing a social aspect to the construction of knowledge within the Science of Knowing.

-   **Process of Construction:** He emphasizes that the conceptual groundwork was set through free and deliberate construction. The comparison of these concepts then sparked a compelling sense of unity and necessity.

-   **Conditions for Insight:** While acknowledging the act of construction, Fichte sees it as creating the preconditions for the 'self-manifesting insight' to occur.

-   **Unconditional Appearance:** In the moment of this insight, its self-evidence leads to a sense of unconditionality within those who experience it.

-   **Self-Manifesting Insight:** What does Fichte mean by 'self-manifesting'? Does this imply an element beyond simple conceptual construction?

-   **Individual vs. Collaborative:** While the experience was shared, what role does the individual mind play in this process of construction and insight?

-   **Unconditionality:** What kind of certainty is implied by the feeling of unconditionality? Does it represent absolute truth or a subjective certainty within the context of the system?

```
But let us not go to work with too much haste;
rather let us consider things a little more deeply.
Did we create what we created because we wished to do so,
and therefore as the result of some earlier knowledge,
which we would have created because we wished to create it
as the result of an even earlier knowledge, and so on to infinity,
so that we might never arrive at a first creation?
Somewhere, if the concept is created it must
absolutely and thoroughly create itself,
without anything antecedent
and without any necessity of a “we”;
because this “we,” as has been shown,
always and everywhere requires some previous knowing
and cannot achieve immediate knowing.
```

-   **Problem of Infinite Regress:** Fichte recognizes that attributing all creation to deliberate acts of the will ('because we wished to do so') leads to an infinite regress where every act of knowing would require prior knowledge, preventing a truly foundational starting point.

-   **Necessity of a 'First Creation':** He argues for a primary, spontaneous act of self-creation by the concept itself, occurring without external guidance or pre-existing knowledge.

-   **'We' as Limiting:** Fichte views the concept of a personal, self-aware 'we' as inherently reliant on some form of prior knowing, thus incapable of initiating truly immediate knowing.

-   **'Concept's' Agency:** What might Fichte mean by the concept "creating itself"? Is this a metaphorical expression or does it imply a kind of independent agency of the concept?

-   **Implications for Understanding:** How would this notion of a 'first creation' reshape one's understanding of the origins of knowledge within the system?

-   **'We' and Immediate Knowing:** How can the gap between the limited 'we' and the necessity of 'immediate knowing' be bridged within Fichte's system?

```
Therefore we cannot create the conditions,
they must emerge spontaneously.
Reason must create itself,
independent from any volition or freedom, or self.
But this proposition, disclosed through analysis,
[contradicts] the first which is given reflexively,
and so immediately.

Which one is true, and on which should we rely?
Before trying to answer, let us return again
to the matter of the insight which has become
controversial in regard to its principle,
in order to grasp its meaning and true worth clearly.
```

-   **Limits of Construction:** Fichte acknowledges that the conditions necessary for insight cannot be deliberately constructed but must arise spontaneously.

-   **Reason's Self-Creation:** This requires reason to create itself without any prior intention, volition, or even a sense of self.

-   **Paradox:** This notion of reason's spontaneous self-creation seems to contradict the previous understanding of insight achieved through deliberate creation of concepts and premises.

-   **Moment of Doubt:** Fichte recognizes a conflict. Which mode of understanding should be trusted - the spontaneous insight or the analytical process?

-   **Return to Insight:** Before seeking a resolution, Fichte aims to re-examine the debated insight to grasp its significance and determine its true value.

-   **Meaning of Spontaneity:** In the context of Fichte's system, what is implied by 'spontaneous emergence' of the conditions for insight?

-   **Nature of the Paradox:** Is this contradiction a fundamental flaw in the system or an invitation for a deeper, more nuanced understanding?

-   **Significance of Reassessment:** Why does Fichte return to the original insight at this moment of paradox? What does he hope to gain?

```
We realized that if light is to be,
then the concept must be posited and negated.
Therefore, the light itself is not
immediately present in this insight,
and the insight does not dissolve into
light and coincide with it;
instead it is only an insight
in relation to the light,
an insight which objectifies it,
grasping it by its inner quality only.
```

-   **Insight vs. 'Pure Light':** The insight into the necessity of positing and negating the concept for 'pure light' to be is not a direct experience of that light itself.

-   **Limited Insight:** The insight remains an intellectual construct with respect to 'pure light'. It understands, objectifies, and conceptualizes it without completely dissolving into it.

-   **Inner Quality:** The insight grasps only the inner quality of 'pure light', namely its function in relation to the concept and 'inconceivable being'.

-   **Nature of the Gap:** What is the nature of the separation between the insight and the 'pure light' on which it is conditioned?

-   **Implications of Objectification:** How does the realization that the insight objectifies 'pure light' impact the understanding of the Science of Knowing?

-   **Potential for Transformation:** Does Fichte suggest a way for the insight to go beyond this initial limitation and eventually merge with the 'pure light'?

```
Thus, whatever the principle and
true bearer of this insight might be,
whether we ourselves, as it seems to be,
or pure self-creating reason, as it also seems to be,
the light is not immediately present in this bearer,
instead it is present merely mediately in
a representative and likeness of itself.
First of all, that this light occurs merely mediately applies not
just in the Science of Knowing but in any possible consciousness
that has to posit a concept so it can annul it;
and the Science of Knowing rests on
a completely different point
than the one on which
many may have assumed it to rest after the last lecture,
because undoubtedly knowing was understood too simply.
```

-   **Mediated Experience of Light:** Whether the bearer of insight is 'us' or 'pure self-creating reason', the experience of 'pure light' is always mediated, not direct.

-   **Universality of Mediation:** This principle of mediation applies not only within the Science of Knowing but to any possible consciousness that relies on concepts and their subsequent negation.

-   **Misunderstanding Corrected:** Fichte acknowledges a potential misunderstanding from previous discussions where 'knowing' might have been conceived too simplistically.

-   **Unique Focus of the Science of Knowing:** He emphasizes that the Science of Knowing rests on a different foundation than simple awareness.

-   **Nature of the 'Representative':** What does Fichte mean by the 'representative or likeness' of 'pure light'? How does it relate to the previously discussed insight?

-   **Implications for 'Knowing':** How does this fundamental mediation transform the understanding of 'knowing' within Fichte's system?

-   **Alternative Foundation:** What is the distinct principle upon which the Science of Knowing rests, if not on the immediate experience of 'pure light'?

```
And now to answer the question:
both are clear, therefore both are equally true;
and so, as was said at the start on another occasion,
manifestness rests neither in one nor in the other,
but entirely between both.
We arrive here,
and this is the first important and significant result,
at the principle of division,
not as before a division between two terms,
which in that case are to be intrinsically distinct
like A and the point,
but instead a division of something
which remains always inwardly self-same through all division.
In a word, we have to do with constructing and creating
the very same primal concepts which appear one time as immanent,
in the unconditionally evident final being, the I;
and appear the other time as emanent,
in reason, absolute and in itself,
which nevertheless is completely objectified.
Thus, it is a division pure and in itself,
without any result or alteration in the object.
```

-   **Resolution through Duality:** The apparent contradiction between the insight's spontaneous origins and its constructed nature is resolved by recognizing that both are simultaneously true, demonstrating a fundamental duality in the process.

-   **Manifestness in Between:** Fichte emphasizes that 'manifestness', or a clear understanding, arises not from one or the other but from the dynamic interplay between these two modes.

-   **The 'Principle of Division':** This leads to the important discovery of the 'principle of division', not as a separation of intrinsically different things as previously seen, but as a division within an element that remains inwardly unified.

-   **Immanent and Emanent:** This division exists between two modes of understanding the same primal concepts: as immanent within the self-evident 'I', and as emanent in objectified, absolute reason.

-   **Pure Division:** Fichte describes this division as 'pure' – a division without causing change in the underlying object.

-   **'Inwardly Self-Same':** How can an element remain 'inwardly self-same' while undergoing this kind of division?

-   **Nature of Immanence and Emanence:** What is Fichte's distinction between 'immanent' and 'emanent' in relation to the primal concepts?

-   **Implications of the Principle:** How does the discovery of the 'principle of division' transform Fichte's understanding of his system?

```
Further, manifestness oscillates
between these two perspectives:
if it is to be really constructed,
then it must be constructed in that way.
Thus, it must be constructed as oscillating
from a to b and again from b to a and
as completely creating both;
thus as oscillating between the twofold oscillation,
which was the first point,
and which gives rise to a three or fivefold synthesis.
```

-   **Oscillation of Understanding:** Fichte argues that 'manifestness' or clear understanding constantly oscillates between the two modes associated with the 'principle of division'.

-   **Necessity of Oscillation for Construction:** For 'manifestness' to be fully constructed within his system, it must be understood as fundamentally dynamic with an oscillation from 'a' to 'b' and back again, continuously generating both.

-   **First Point and Synthesis** This oscillation between two perspectives interacts with a previous oscillation mentioned (likely the one between the concept and the inconceivable) resulting in either a three- or fivefold synthesis within the system.

-   **Meaning of 'a' and 'b'** What do 'a' and 'b' symbolize in this context? Do they relate to the 'immanent' and 'emanent' modes mentioned previously, or something else?

-   **Nature of the 'First Point'** What is the 'first point' of oscillation that Fichte refers to? Does it relate to specific concepts within his system?

-   **Three or Fivefold Synthesis** What determines whether the resultant synthesis is three or fivefold? What are the implications of this variation?

```
What is the common element in all these determinations?
The very same representative of the light,
seen in its familiar inner quality.
Here it stays.
Therefore everything is the same
one common consciousness of light.
This consciousness, which is held in common
and therefore cannot be really constructed
but instead can only be thought
by means of the Science of Knowing,
can be regarded or represented in
the three or fivefold modifications only
from another standpoint, which this science alone oversees.
```

-   **Common Element:** Despite the variety of determinations within the system, the underlying presence of "the representative of the light" provides a unifying factor, maintaining its familiar inner quality.

-   **Unity of Consciousness:** All these variations are part of a 'common consciousness of light'. This consciousness is a shared, foundational element that cannot be fully constructed but can be cognized through the Science of Knowing.

-   **Multiple Modifications:** This shared 'consciousness of light' can be represented in various ways ('three or fivefold modifications') depending on the perspective taken within the system.

-   **Unique Standpoint of the Science of Knowing:** The Science of Knowing provides a unique vantage point from which to understand and reconcile these different modes of representation.

-   **Nature of 'Representative':** What is meant by the 'representative of the light'? Is it a mental faculty, a principle, or something else?

-   **Implications of Unity:** How does the idea of a 'common consciousness of light' shape Fichte's understanding of the relationship between multiplicity and unity within his system?

-   **'Three or Fivefold Modifications':** What are the possible references to these different modes of representation? Do they correspond to previous concepts?
