Notes:
- These species names are provisional and intended as a systematic, readable 3^4 expansion. Each species can be expanded into a 150–300 word proof (showing dyadic antecedents, conceptual anchors, and textual cross-references to `genera.txt` / `species.txt` / Fichte/Kant anchors).
- Next steps: (1) convert this list into `Idea/Prolegomena/species.txt` (OWL) if you want machine-structured nodes, or (2) I can flesh each species into a short proof paragraph and cross-link to `refutation-kantian-dualism-kant-fichte.md` and `fichte-prolegomena.md`.
