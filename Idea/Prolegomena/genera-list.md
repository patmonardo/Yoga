title: Genera List — canonical genera (rewritten)
---

Source anchor: `Idea/Prolegomena/genera.txt`

This file records the canonical genera for the Logic project. Each entry mirrors the `rdfs:label` items in `genera.txt` and adds a concise gloss. Use this file as the authoritative genera index for species expansion and proofs.

**Top-level genera**

- Being — The domain of determinateness, existence, and modes of presence.
- Essence — The domain of reflection, appearance, and actuality (structure of underlying determinations).
- The Concept — The domain of conceptual determination: subjectivity, objectivity, and ideas.

**Being (primary subdivisions)**

- Quality — Determinations of qualitative form and differences.
- Quantity — Magnitude, continuous/discrete distinctions, and related measures.
- Measure — The determination of quantitative form into measure (relations among magnitudes).

**Key Being subitems (labels from `genera.txt`)**

- Being — the determinate present (formal presence).
- Existence — instantiation or actuality of determinate being.
- Being-for-itself — self-related being; the for-itself structure.

**Quantity subitems**

- Quantity — pure magnitude-form.
- Quantum — specific quantum/magnitude distinctions.
- Ratio — formal ratios and relations among quantities.

**Measure subitems**

- Specific Quantity — the specific quantum or unit.
- Real Measure — relations of measures in determinate systems.
- Becoming of Essence — measures as loci of essence-transition.

**Essence (primary subdivisions)**

- Reflection — determinations internal to essence (identity, difference, contradiction).
- Appearance — the manifold of appearance, things, and world-structure.
- Actuality — modes by which essence is realized or exhibited.

**Reflection subitems**

- Shine — the determinate moment of essence manifesting.
- Reflect (the determinations of reflection) — identity, difference, contradiction.
- Ground — determinate grounds for essence.

**Appearance subitems**

- The Thing and Its Properties — object constitution: substratum and properties.
- The World of Appearance — appearance as system/world.
- The Essential Relation — relations of whole and parts, force and expression.

**Actuality subitems**

- The Exposition of the Absolute — the form in which the absolute is exhibited.
- The Absolute Attribute — attributes of the absolute.
- The Mode of the Absolute — modalities in which the absolute appears.

**The Concept (primary subdivisions)**

- Subjectivity — standpoint, judgment, syllogistic forms.
- Objectivity — external relational forms: mechanism, chemism, teleology.
- Idea — the absolute idea and life/cognition relations.

**Subjectivity subitems**

- The Concept — the concept as such.
- Judgment — the form of judgment; the norms of assertion.
- Syllogism — forms of inference and inferential relations.

**Objectivity subitems**

- Mechanism — law-like, causal organization.
- Chemism — reciprocal relations and interactions.
- Teleology — end-directed organization and purposive form.

**Idea subitems**

- Life — organizing and autopoietic forms of the idea.
- Cognition — the idea in cognitive form.
- The Absolute Idea — the culminating self-positing idea.


Notes & usage

- This file replaces the provisional genera mapping in the Dialectical Cube appendix. It is derived from `Idea/Prolegomena/genera.txt` and intended as the canonical genera index for the 3^4 expansion.
- When generating species (`Idea/Prolegomena/species-list.md`), expand each genus here into three species (or more detailed species as required), and cite back to the appropriate `genera.txt` label where relevant.
- If you want different granularity (more/less subdivisions) or alternative labels, indicate which genus to edit and I will update this file.
