    "**First Edition**:\n",
    "- **Key Phrase**: \"All substances, insofar as they are simultaneous, stand in thoroughgoing community (i.e., interaction with one another).\"\n",

    "### Final Analysis of Kant's Third Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Kant's Third Analogy discusses the principle of simultaneity according to the law of interaction, or community, among substances. The core ideas can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simultaneity and Interaction**:\n",
    "   - Simultaneity of substances in space requires their mutual interaction.\n",
    "   - Without interaction, substances cannot be perceived as simultaneous.\n",
    "   - Reciprocal influence is necessary for the empirical cognition of simultaneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamical Relations**:\n",
    "   - The three fundamental dynamical relations are inherence, consequence, and composition.\n",
    "   - These relations form the basis for understanding how substances interact and coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Objective Ground and Perception**:\n",
    "   - For the subjective community of perceptions to rest on an objective ground, substances must reciprocally determine their positions in time.\n",
    "   - This reciprocal determination allows for the representation of substances as existing simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community of Apperception**:\n",
    "   - All appearances in the mind must stand in a community of apperception.\n",
    "   - Objects must be represented as connected and existing simultaneously through this community.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real Community (Commercium)**:\n",
    "   - A real community of substances, or commercium, is necessary for the empirical relation of simultaneity.\n",
    "   - This commerce among appearances forms a composite (compositum reale) and involves continuous influence.\n",
