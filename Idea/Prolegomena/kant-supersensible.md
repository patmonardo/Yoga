Remark II. The following important comment suggests itself here: namely, that there are three kinds of antinomy of pure reason, which, however, all coincide in this, that they force reason to give up the otherwise very natural presupposition that holds objects of the senses to be things in themselves, and rather to count them as appearances, and ascribe to them an intelligible substratum (something supersensible, the concept of which is only an idea and permits no genuine cognition). Without such an antinomy reason would never be able to decide on the assumption of a principle that so narrows the ﬁeld of its speculation and on sacriﬁces in which so many otherwise shining hopes must entirely disappear; for even now, when in compensation for these losses an all the greater employ- ment opens up for it in a practical respect, it seems unable to depart from those hopes and to free itself from its old dependency without pain.

Kant's "Remark II" touches on a crucial aspect of his philosophy, particularly concerning the limitations and nature of human cognition. Let's break down this passage to understand its implications:

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**Remark II.** **The following important comment suggests itself here: namely, that there are three kinds of antinomy of pure reason, which, however, all coincide in this, that they force reason to give up the otherwise very natural presupposition that holds objects of the senses to be things in themselves, and rather to count them as appearances, and ascribe to them an intelligible substratum (something supersensible, the concept of which is only an idea and permits no genuine cognition).**

1.  **Three Kinds of Antinomy**: Kant refers to three types of conflicts (antinomies) within pure reason. These antinomies arise when reason reaches contradictory conclusions when it tries to go beyond possible experience and comprehend the totality of phenomena (e.g., the beginning of the universe, the nature of causality).

2.  **Natural Presupposition**: He notes that the natural tendency of human reason is to assume that the objects we perceive through our senses are things in themselves (that is, they exist independently of our perception).

3.  **Appearance vs. Thing-in-Itself**: Kant argues that these antinomies force us to reconsider this assumption. Instead of viewing sensory objects as things in themselves, we should regard them as appearances. This implies that what we perceive is not the ultimate reality but a representation shaped by our cognitive faculties.

4.  **Intelligible Substratum**: He suggests that there is an underlying reality (a "supersensible" or "intelligible substratum") behind these appearances. However, this reality is only an idea and cannot be known through empirical means or genuine cognition.

**Without such an antinomy reason would never be able to decide on the assumption of a principle that so narrows the field of its speculation and on sacrifices in which so many otherwise shining hopes must entirely disappear;**

5.  **Purpose of Antinomies**: The role of these antinomies is to push reason towards a crucial realization. Without encountering these contradictions, reason would never adopt a principle that limits its speculative reach. This limitation, although it might seem like a sacrifice, is essential for avoiding erroneous conclusions about the nature of reality.

**for even now, when in compensation for these losses an all the greater employment opens up for it in a practical respect, it seems unable to depart from those hopes and to free itself from its old dependency without pain.**

6.  **Practical Compensation**: Although reason must give up some speculative ambitions, it gains a greater role in practical philosophy. This shift from speculative to practical reason allows for a deeper engagement with moral and ethical concerns.

7.  **Difficulty of Transition**: Kant acknowledges the difficulty reason faces in letting go of its speculative hopes. This transition involves a painful process of breaking free from old dependencies and habits of thought.

### Summary and Implications

Kant's remark illustrates a critical juncture in his philosophy where pure reason is compelled to recognize its limitations. The antinomies, by highlighting the contradictions in speculative reason, force a reevaluation of our understanding of sensory objects and their relation to the underlying reality. This leads to the crucial distinction between appearances (phenomena) and things in themselves (noumena).

By accepting this distinction, reason can avoid futile speculations about the ultimate nature of reality, focusing instead on practical matters where it can achieve genuine knowledge and make significant contributions to human understanding and ethical life. This transition, while difficult, marks a necessary evolution in the use of reason.

That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles; for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself. There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cogni- tion; 2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure; 3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles. This section of Kant's remark elaborates on the nature and origin of the three kinds of antinomy he previously mentioned. Let's analyze it line by line to understand its implications:

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles;**

1.  **Three Cognitive Faculties**: Kant identifies three primary faculties of cognition: understanding, judgment, and reason. Each of these faculties operates based on principles that are known a priori (independent of experience).

2.  **A Priori Principles**: These faculties each have their own a priori principles, which are fundamental rules or concepts that structure our experience and knowledge.

**for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself.**

3.  **Demand for the Unconditioned**: Reason, when reflecting on these principles and their application, seeks the unconditioned basis for any given conditioned reality. This is a pursuit of an ultimate, foundational principle that does not depend on anything else.

4.  **Limitation of Sensible Knowledge**: This unconditioned basis cannot be found if we treat sensory objects (the sensible) as things in themselves. Instead, we must recognize them as mere appearances, with their true nature being something supersensible (intelligible substratum).

5.  **Supersensible Substratum**: The true, underlying reality is the intelligible substratum that lies beyond sensory experience. It is the thing in itself, which cannot be directly known through empirical means but is necessary to account for the coherence of our experiences.

**There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cognition;**

6.  **Antinomy in Theoretical Use**: The first antinomy arises in the theoretical use of the understanding, which seeks to extend knowledge to the unconditioned basis of cognition. This involves conflicts when reason attempts to comprehend the totality of conditions.

**2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure;**

7.  **Antinomy in Aesthetic Use**: The second antinomy occurs in the aesthetic use of the power of judgment, particularly in relation to feelings of pleasure and displeasure. This reflects the tension between subjective aesthetic experiences and the universal principles we seek to apply to them.

**3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles.**

8.  **Antinomy in Practical Use**: The third antinomy concerns the practical use of reason, particularly in its role as self-legislative. This involves conflicts between the moral law (an a priori principle) and the pursuit of desires, highlighting the challenge of applying unconditional moral principles to concrete situations.

### Summary and Implications

Kant's exposition here highlights the intrinsic conflicts (antinomies) that arise within pure reason as it seeks to extend its principles beyond the limits of possible experience. These antinomies reflect deeper issues within the three faculties of cognition—understanding, judgment, and reason—each striving to apply its a priori principles unconditionally.

-   **Understanding**: Faces antinomies when reason attempts to comprehend the ultimate basis of theoretical knowledge.
-   **Judgment**: Encounters conflicts in the realm of aesthetics, where subjective experiences of beauty and taste resist universal categorization.
-   **Reason**: Struggles in its practical application, particularly in reconciling moral imperatives with the desires and conditions of practical life.

These antinomies ultimately force a reconsideration of the assumptions about the nature of sensory objects and the scope of human cognition, pushing reason to recognize its limits and the necessity of an intelligible substratum behind appearances. This shift is crucial for Kant's critical philosophy, as it underscores the boundaries of human knowledge and the importance of practical reason in navigating these limitations.

With regard to two antinomies of those higher cognitive faculties, that of the theoretical and that of the practical employment, we have already shown elsewhere their unavoidability if judgments of this kind do not look back to a supersensible substratum of the given objects, as appearances, but also their resolvability as soon as the latter happens. Now as far as the antinomy in the use of the power of judgment and the resolution of it given here are concerned, there is no other means for avoiding it than either to deny that the aesthetic judgment of taste is grounded on any principle a priori, so that all claim to the necessity of universal assent is a groundless, empty delusion, and a judgment of taste deserves to be held to be correct only insofar as it happens that many people agree about it, and even this, strictly speaking, not because one suspects an a priori principle behind this consensus, but rather (as in the taste of the palate) because the subjects are contingently organized in the same way; or one must assume that the judgment of taste is really a concealed judgment of reason about the perfection that is revealed in a thing and the relation of the manifold in it to an end, so that it is called aesthetic only on account of the confusion that attaches to this reﬂection of ours, although at bottom it is teleological – in which case one could declare the resolution of the antinomy by means of transcendental ideas to be unnecessary and void, and thus unite those laws of taste with the objects of the senses not as mere appearances but also as things in themselves. But how little the one as well as the other subterfuge succeeds has been shown in several places in the exposition of the judgments of taste. \### Line-by-Line Analysis of Kant's Remark on Antinomies

**With regard to two antinomies of those higher cognitive faculties, that of the theoretical and that of the practical employment, we have already shown elsewhere their unavoidability if judgments of this kind do not look back to a supersensible substratum of the given objects, as appearances, but also their resolvability as soon as the latter happens.**

1.  **Unavoidability of Antinomies**: Kant emphasizes that the antinomies in theoretical and practical reason are unavoidable if we do not consider the supersensible substratum (the underlying reality beyond sensory appearances). Without this consideration, judgments in these realms inevitably lead to contradictions.

2.  **Resolving Antinomies**: However, these antinomies can be resolved when we acknowledge this supersensible substratum, which allows for a coherent understanding of the given objects as appearances rather than things in themselves.

**Now as far as the antinomy in the use of the power of judgment and the resolution of it given here are concerned, there is no other means for avoiding it than either to deny that the aesthetic judgment of taste is grounded on any principle a priori, so that all claim to the necessity of universal assent is a groundless, empty delusion, and a judgment of taste deserves to be held to be correct only insofar as it happens that many people agree about it, and even this, strictly speaking, not because one suspects an a priori principle behind this consensus, but rather (as in the taste of the palate) because the subjects are contingently organized in the same way;**

3.  **Antinomy in Aesthetic Judgment**: Kant discusses the antinomy in the power of judgment, specifically in aesthetic judgment. One way to avoid this antinomy is to deny that aesthetic judgments are based on any a priori principles, suggesting that the universal agreement on matters of taste is a mere coincidence and not grounded in any fundamental principle.

4.  **Groundless Consensus**: If we deny the a priori principle behind aesthetic judgment, then any claim to universal agreement in taste becomes an illusion. Aesthetic judgments would then be seen as correct only if many people happen to agree, which is not due to any inherent principle but because of a contingent similarity in their subjective experiences.

**or one must assume that the judgment of taste is really a concealed judgment of reason about the perfection that is revealed in a thing and the relation of the manifold in it to an end, so that it is called aesthetic only on account of the confusion that attaches to this reﬂection of ours, although at bottom it is teleological – in which case one could declare the resolution of the antinomy by means of transcendental ideas to be unnecessary and void, and thus unite those laws of taste with the objects of the senses not as mere appearances but also as things in themselves.**

5.  **Teleological Interpretation of Taste**: The alternative is to assume that judgments of taste are actually concealed judgments of reason, reflecting the perfection and purposiveness in the object. This would mean that aesthetic judgments are fundamentally teleological (related to the purposes and ends within the object).

6.  **Unnecessary Transcendental Resolution**: If aesthetic judgments are teleological, the resolution of the antinomy through transcendental ideas becomes unnecessary. The laws of taste could then be seen as applicable to sensory objects not just as appearances but as things in themselves.

**But how little the one as well as the other subterfuge succeeds has been shown in several places in the exposition of the judgments of taste.**

7.  **Failure of Both Approaches**: Kant notes that neither of these approaches—denying the a priori principle or interpreting aesthetic judgments as teleological—succeeds. He has demonstrated the inadequacies of both solutions in his exposition of judgments of taste.

### Summary and Implications

-   **Three Antinomies**: Kant identifies three antinomies corresponding to the faculties of understanding, judgment, and reason. Each involves inherent conflicts when trying to extend principles unconditionally within the realm of appearances.

-   **Resolution through Supersensible Substratum**: The resolution of these antinomies requires acknowledging a supersensible substratum, which shifts our understanding from appearances to a deeper reality that underpins them.

-   **Challenges in Aesthetic Judgment**: Specifically for aesthetic judgment, Kant highlights the difficulty in grounding universal judgments of taste. Denying a priori principles reduces these judgments to contingent agreements, while interpreting them teleologically fails to address the underlying conflicts adequately.

-   **Critique of Superficial Solutions**: Kant criticizes both denying the a priori basis and the teleological interpretation of taste as insufficient, demonstrating that the deeper philosophical challenges require more robust solutions.

Kant's analysis emphasizes the complexity of reconciling theoretical, aesthetic, and practical uses of reason within the framework of human cognition, underscoring the need for a nuanced approach that considers both the limitations and potentials of our cognitive faculties.

But if it is conceded that our deduction is at least on the right track, even if it has not been made clear enough in every detail, then three ideas are revealed: ﬁrst, that of the supersensible in general, without further determination, as the substratum of nature; second, the very same thing, as the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our faculty of cognition; third, the very same thing, as the principle of the ends of freedom and principle of the correspondence of freedom with those ends in the moral sphere \### Analysis of Kant's Concluding Remarks

**But if it is conceded that our deduction is at least on the right track, even if it has not been made clear enough in every detail, then three ideas are revealed:**

1.  **Concession on Deduction's Validity**: Kant acknowledges that while his deduction may not be perfectly clear in every aspect, it is still on the right path. This concession sets the stage for the introduction of three significant ideas that emerge from his philosophical exploration.

**first, that of the supersensible in general, without further determination, as the substratum of nature;**

2.  **Supersensible as Substratum of Nature**: The first idea is the concept of the supersensible as a general, undetermined substratum of nature. This suggests that beyond the sensory appearances, there is a fundamental reality that underlies and supports the natural world. This reality is not accessible through ordinary sensory experience but is a necessary postulate for making sense of the natural world as a coherent whole.

**second, the very same thing, as the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our faculty of cognition;**

3.  **Subjective Purposiveness of Nature**: The second idea is that this supersensible substratum serves as the principle of subjective purposiveness in nature. This means that nature appears to be organized in a way that aligns with our cognitive faculties, making it intelligible and comprehensible to us. This principle explains why nature can be studied and understood through scientific inquiry, as it seems to be purposefully arranged to facilitate our understanding.

**third, the very same thing, as the principle of the ends of freedom and principle of the correspondence of freedom with those ends in the moral sphere.**

4.  **Principle of Ends of Freedom**: The third idea is that the supersensible substratum also functions as the principle of the ends of freedom in the moral sphere. This principle suggests that our moral actions and the ends they aim to achieve are grounded in the same supersensible reality. It ensures that our moral pursuits are not arbitrary but are aligned with a deeper, universal order that corresponds with our sense of freedom and moral duty.

### Summary and Implications

-   **Unified Supersensible Substratum**: Kant reveals a unified concept of the supersensible substratum that underlies different aspects of human experience—nature, cognition, and morality. This substratum is a fundamental reality that supports the intelligibility of the natural world, the purposiveness perceived in nature, and the alignment of moral ends with our sense of freedom.

-   **Three Aspects of Supersensible**: The three revealed ideas highlight different roles of the supersensible:

    -   **Nature**: As the general substratum that provides coherence to the sensory world.
    -   **Cognition**: As the principle that makes nature's purposiveness accessible to our cognitive faculties.
    -   **Morality**: As the principle that aligns moral actions and ends with a universal order, grounding our sense of freedom in a meaningful context.

-   **Philosophical Coherence**: Kant's conclusion emphasizes the coherence and interconnectedness of his philosophical system, where the supersensible serves as a unifying foundation for understanding nature, cognition, and morality. This unification underscores the depth and complexity of Kant's critical philosophy, aiming to bridge the gap between empirical experience and metaphysical speculation.

-   **Practical and Theoretical Integration**: The ideas also reflect Kant's attempt to integrate practical and theoretical reason, showing that the same underlying principles that make scientific inquiry possible also support moral action and ethical considerations. This holistic view is central to Kant's critical philosophy, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework for human understanding and action.

By revealing these three ideas, Kant encapsulates the core of his transcendental idealism, emphasizing the importance of the supersensible as a necessary postulate for making sense of both the natural and moral worlds. This synthesis aims to offer a robust foundation for human cognition and moral practice, grounded in the unity of the supersensible substratum.
