title: Kant’s Opus Postumum — “Doctrine of Science” and the Highest Standpoint
---

### Why Opus Postumum matters here

Kant’s *Opus postumum* (late notes, unfinished) is easy to sideline because:

- it is fragmentary and editorially difficult,
- it doesn’t present a clean, finished “system” like the Critiques,
- and it has been historically narrated (often lazily) as the work of a declining mind.

But for a Kant → Fichte → Schelling/Hegel trajectory, it can be philosophically decisive precisely because it shows Kant still working on:

- the **highest standpoint** of transcendental philosophy,
- the unity of nature/world and the supersensible,
- and a “transition” problem (how the system becomes a world).

This note is anchored to your extracted source text in [Archive/text/Ist fascicle sheet V.txt](../../Archive/text/Ist%20fascicle%20sheet%20V.txt).

### The “highest standpoint”: God and the World (mutually related)

One fertile way to read the late Kant is: the highest transcendental standpoint is expressed through two mutually related Ideas:

- **God**
- **World**

Under this reading, they are not merely two separate topics (theology vs cosmology), but a pair that jointly expresses the systematic horizon within which the critical project is completed.

The key claim is not that Kant becomes a pre-critical dogmatist. Rather:

- “God” and “World” function as **systematic poles** required to articulate the full form of transcendental philosophy’s unity.

In your extracted pages Kant states the “highest standpoint” theme extremely directly, even at the level of the title:

```
The Highest Standpoint
of Transcendental Philosophy
in the
System of Ideas: God, the World, and
Man in the World,
Restricting Himself Through Laws of Duty,
```

So the “God / World / Man-in-the-world (duty)” triad is not an interpretive gloss; it is how the project is explicitly scaffolded in these materials.

### “Doctrine of Science” (Wissenschaftslehre)

In the late material, Kant sometimes uses language that can be rendered as “doctrine of science” (*Wissenschaftslehre*). This is philosophically electrifying for a Fichte reader because *Wissenschaftslehre* is also the name of Fichte’s central project.

Two cautions keep the connection sharp instead of sensational:

- **Terminology caution**: “Wissenschaftslehre” can be used generically as “a doctrine/theory of science,” not necessarily as an endorsement of Fichte’s specific system.
- **Editorial caution**: Opus Postumum is note-like; exactly how to attribute strong doctrinal claims depends on edition, ordering, and interpretive reconstruction.

Still, the resonance is real: late Kant can appear to gesture toward a standpoint where transcendental philosophy becomes explicitly a **science of science** (a self-reflexive account of the conditions and unity of knowledge).

Your extracted text contains a literal header where Kant frames philosophy this way:

```
PHILOSOPHY
AS DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE [Wissenschafislehre|
IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM,
```

And shortly after:

```
Nature and freedom are the two hinges (principles) of philosophy, found-
ing it. Physiology (as pure product of reason) can be either the doctrine of
science [Wissenschafislehre] or the doctrine of wisdom |Weisheitslehre].
```

Even in this rough, note-like state, the intent is unambiguous: “doctrine of science” is tied to system-form and to the articulation of nature/freedom.

### Schelling (STI) appears in the background (interpretive note)

Your Opus Postumum slant adds a very specific (and philosophically important) claim:

- Right before Kant’s “philosophy as doctrine of science” (*Wissenschaftslehre*) language, there are references to **Schelling’s _System of Transcendental Idealism_** (and not, at that point, to the later “identity philosophy” register).

Your extracted text contains explicit marginal references, including:

```
System of Transcendental Idealism, by Schelling.
vide Litteratur-Zeitung, Erlangen No. 82, 83.
```

and earlier:

```
System of Transcendental Idealism, by Schelling, Spinoza, Lichtenberg, and,
as it were, three dimensions: present, past and future.
```

If that textual neighborhood is as you recall it, it matters for the Kant→Fichte→Schelling/Hegel story in a nontrivial way:

- It suggests late Kant is still thinking in a space where **transcendental idealism is a living systematic option**, not merely a concluded episode.
- It also helps explain why “Wissenschaftslehre” can sound, from within Kant, like a *system-form* demand rather than an imported Fichtean slogan.

This means the “Schelling STI reference near the Wissenschaftslehre heading” point is now textually grounded (at least in this extracted fascicle).

### “A system turns to dust once abandoned” (what this means here)

On your reading, Kant’s late stance is not merely historical commentary; it encodes a methodological warning:

- If a philosopher **abandons transcendental idealism** (or abandons the system-form that secures it), the system does not “peacefully continue” as a set of detachable theses.
- It **collapses** ("turns to dust") because its core claims depend on an integrated standpoint and method.

This is a powerful lens for the Schelling→Hegel handoff:

- If Schelling leaves transcendental idealism behind and the project is “handed over” to Hegel, that can be read (in this Kantian warning register) as an abandonment that forces a re-grounding, not a mere continuation.

Your extracted text also supports the general “system-or-aggregate” insistence (even if it doesn’t contain the exact “turns to dust” phrase). For example:

```
Transcendental philosophy is autonomy, that is, a reason that determinately
delineates its synthetic principles, scope, and limits, in a complete system.
```

### How this bears on the Kant–Fichte dispute

If this reading is right, it reframes the usual story.

Instead of:

- Kant = fixed critical architect; Fichte = external radicalizer,

you get:

- Kant’s own late work = pressure toward a higher systematic standpoint,
  where a “doctrine of science” name becomes intelligible.

This does not settle whether Kant “accepts” Fichte; it sharpens a different point:

- The Critiques might not be Kant’s last word on the system’s unity.

---

### Bridge to your “nondual science” lens

If your guiding theme is “nondual unity that must be genetic (self-constructing),” then Opus Postumum is interesting because:

- it can be read as Kant groping toward a standpoint where the world-system is not merely bounded by Ideas, but is organized from a higher unity.

That’s close to the kind of move that later idealists demand explicitly.

### Open slot (for your exact passage)

If you paste the lines you have in mind (German or English), this note can be tightened to your preferred formulation and anchored to the precise wording (e.g., how Kant states the mutual relation of God/World and where he calls it “Doctrine of Science”).
