    "    but not, as with those having the latter as their principle,\n",
    "    as their proper work.\n",
    "    Instead, it is a divine work in them,\n",

    "    as well as the resulting desire and pleasure.\n",
    "    Other people also exist besides themselves, and a sensible world.\n",
    "    Yet, they do so always only as an emanation of one divine life.\n",

    "    but not for his own sake;\n",
    "    instead, so that he maintains the moral law.\n",
    "    If they had no moral law, they would not need a God.\n",

    "    but only just so that they can be, or become, moral,\n",
    "    and they have a sensible world simply as a sphere for moral action.\n",
    "    Likewise, God is present for the legal standpoint,\n",
    "    but he exists only in order to manage the\n",
    "    higher police work that lies beyond the reach of human policing.\n",
    "    Legality also has a morality;\n",
    "    however, it coincides with outward integrity\n",
    "    in relation to others, and ends there.\n",
    "    Finally [there is] a sensible world,\n",
    "    for the purpose of civic industry.\n",
    "    Fourth, God surely has a place within the principle of sensibility,\n",
    "    if it is left to itself and does not become\n",
    "    unnaturally depraved through perverse speculation.\n",
    "    That is, God exists so that he can give us food in due season.\n",
    "    With this comes a certain morality,\n",
    "    namely to spread one's pleasures wisely,\n",
    "    that one always has something more to enjoy,\n",
    "    especially not to ruin things\n",
    "    with this God who provides.\n",
    "    Finally, there is also something analogous\n",
    "    to reason and spirituality\n",
    "    and that is also to enjoy these pleasures\n",
    "    in the right order and with prudence.\n",
