# Commentary on Yoga Sutra III.53: The Triadic Structure of Time and Consciousness

## The Sutra

**Sanskrit:** क्षण तत् क्रमयोः संयमात् विवेकजं ज्ञानम्

**Transliteration:** *Kṣaṇa krama-yoḥ saṁyamāt viveka-jaṁ jñānam*

**Translation:** "By performing samyama on kṣaṇa and krama, one attains knowledge born of discrimination (viveka-jam jñānam)."

## Triadic Logical Structure

### 1. Universal Level
**Kṣaṇa (The Principle - Beginning)**
- Represents the Universal aspect
- The Beginning of the Truth of Prajña
- Embodies Being itself
- Functions as the Principle in the triadic structure
- Correlates to the Absolute Unconditioned

### 2. Particular Level
**Krama (The Law - End)**
- Represents the Particular aspect
- The End in the Sequence of Mediation
- Manifests as the particulars of the Universal
- Encompasses both Absolute and Relative Unconditioned
- Functions as Law in the sequence

### 3. Singular Level
**Tat (The Singular Truth)**
- Represents the Singular aspect
- Serves as the Truth of both Dharana and Dhyana
- Unifies the Universal and Particular
- Embodies the concrete singular instance
- Mediates between Principle and Law

## The Structure of Mediation

### 1. The Beginning (Universal)
- **Kṣaṇa** as Principle
- Truth of Prajña
- Being in its universal aspect
- The Absolute foundation

### 2. The End (Particular)
- **Krama** as Law
- Sequence of Mediation
- Particularization of the Universal
- Both Absolute and Relative aspects

### 3. The Unification (Singular)
- **Tat** as Singular Truth
- Unity of Dharana and Dhyana
- Concrete realization
- Integration of Universal and Particular

## Philosophical Implications

### 1. Logic of the Universal
- **Principle (Kṣaṇa)**
  - Beginning of Truth
  - Universal aspect of Being
  - Foundation of all meditation
  - Source of Prajña

### 2. Logic of the Particular
- **Law (Krama)**
  - End sequence
  - Particularization process
  - Mediation of Universal
  - Absolute and Relative aspects unified

### 3. Logic of the Singular
- **Truth (Tat)**
  - Integration point
  - Unity of concentration and meditation
  - Concrete realization
  - Living synthesis

## Practical Application

### 1. Understanding the Triadic Structure
- Recognize the Universal (Kṣaṇa) as Principle
- Observe the Particular (Krama) as Law
- Experience the Singular (Tat) as integrating Truth

### 2. Meditation Practice
- Begin with the Universal Principle (Kṣaṇa)
- Move through the Particular sequence (Krama)
- Achieve Singular integration (Tat)

### 3. Integration Process
- Universal → Particular → Singular movement
- Recognition of each level's unique role
- Understanding of their necessary interconnection

## The Process of Realization

### 1. Universal Level (Kṣaṇa)
- Recognition of the Principle
- Connection with the Truth of Prajña
- Experience of Universal Being

### 2. Particular Level (Krama)
- Understanding of the Law
- Observation of sequential unfoldment
- Integration of Absolute and Relative

### 3. Singular Level (Tat)
- Realization of concrete Truth
- Unity of Dharana and Dhyana
- Living synthesis of Universal and Particular

## Conclusion

Yoga Sutra III.53 reveals a sophisticated triadic logical structure that moves from Universal through Particular to Singular. This movement is not merely theoretical but represents the actual process of meditation and realization:

- **Kṣaṇa** as the Universal Principle, representing the Beginning and the Truth of Prajña
- **Krama** as the Particular Law, embodying the End in the sequence of mediation
- **Tat** as the Singular Truth, unifying Dharana and Dhyana

This triadic structure provides both a theoretical framework and a practical guide for meditation and realization. The movement from Universal through Particular to Singular represents the complete path of understanding and integration.

The sutra thus reveals not just a practice but a complete logical structure for understanding the relationship between consciousness, time, and realization. Through proper understanding and application of this triadic structure, the practitioner can navigate the path from universal principle to singular realization.

*Note: This commentary emphasizes the precise triadic logical structure of Universal-Particular-Singular and the specific roles of Kṣaṇa (Principle/Beginning), Krama (Law/End), and Tat (Singular Truth) in the process of realization. It maintains the rigorous logical relationships while providing practical guidance for understanding and application.*
