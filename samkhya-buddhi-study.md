# Sāṅkhya-buddhi in BG Chapter 2: Establishment in Brahman-prajñā

## I. The Ground of Pure Self-Evidence

### A. Distinction from Īśvara
1. Key Marker in 2.17:
   - न कश्चित्कर्तुमर्हति (na kaścit kartum arhati)
   - "Not even God can destroy"
   - Beyond divine agency

2. Nature of Self-Evidence:
   - अप्रमेय (aprameya) - beyond proof
   - अधिगम्यते (adhigamyate) - self-evident
   - Prior to personal divine consciousness

### B. Pure Brahman-prajñā
1. Beyond Ownership:
   - No possession possible
   - Prior to "mine-ness"
   - Pure self-evidence

2. Original Synthetic Unity:
   - Prior to subject-object split
   - Beyond agency/ownership
   - Pure brahman-knowledge

## II. The Three Transformations

### A. Nirodha-pariṇāma
1. Transcendence of Sensibility:
   - सर्वदुःखानां हानिः (sarvaduḥkhānāṃ hāniḥ)
   - Giving up all disturbance
   - Leading to śānti

### B. Samādhi-pariṇāma
1. Beyond Objects:
   - सर्व-अर्थ transcendence
   - Moving toward एकाग्रता
   - Pure consciousness

### C. Ekāgratā-pariṇāma
1. Establishment in Prajñā:
   - बुद्धिः पर्यवतिष्ठते (buddhiḥ paryavatiṣṭhate)
   - Unity of concept-inference
   - Pure reason established

## III. From Pratyāhāra to Dhāraṇā

### A. Ground in Yoga-buddhi (2.38)
1. Initial Stability:
   - सुखदुःखे समे कृत्वा (sukhaduḥkhe same kṛtvā)
   - Balance in opposites
   - Foundation for transformation

### B. Progress Through Transformations
1. Through Pratyāhāra:
   - Withdrawal from sensibility
   - Moving beyond objects
   - Toward pure consciousness

2. Into Dhāraṇā:
   - एकाग्रता establishment
   - Unity of reason
   - Truth of prajñā

## IV. Philosophical Structure

### A. Pure Transcendental Method
1. Not Dialectical Development:
   - Direct establishment
   - Through self-evidence
   - Original synthetic unity

2. Beyond Personal Divine:
   - Prior to Īśvara
   - Pure brahman-knowledge
   - Absolute self-evidence

### B. Complete Ground
1. For Later Development:
   - Foundation established
   - Pure self-evidence shown
   - Prior to all derivation

2. Unity Achieved:
   - Through transformations
   - In pure prajñā
   - As brahman-knowledge

## V. Key Insights

1. The text clearly establishes prajñā as Brahman not Īśvara through:
   - Explicit markers ("not even God")
   - Three transformations
   - Pure self-evidence

2. This explains the progression:
   - From sensible withdrawal
   - Through object transcendence
   - To pure unity

3. The achievement is:
   - Establishment in pure prajñā
   - Beyond personal divine
   - Original synthetic unity

4. This grounds what follows by:
   - Establishing pure self-evidence
   - Prior to all derivation
   - As absolute foundation
