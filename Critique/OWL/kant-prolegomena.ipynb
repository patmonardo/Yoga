    "The \"Preamble on the Distinguishing Feature of All Metaphysical Cognition\" serves as an essential introduction to Kant's \"Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Come Forward as Science.\" In this section, Kant sets out to clarify the unique nature of metaphysical knowledge and its distinction from other forms of cognition. This groundwork is crucial for understanding the entire project of the Prolegomena, which aims to establish the possibility and outline the conditions of metaphysics as a science. Here's an exploration of the key points and implications of this preamble:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points of the Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Nature of Metaphysical Knowledge**: Kant begins by addressing the question of what makes metaphysical knowledge distinct from empirical science and mathematics. He identifies metaphysical cognition as dealing with concepts and principles that are not derived from experience, such as the concepts of time, space, causality, and necessity. This kind of knowledge seeks to extend beyond the limits of empirical inquiry, aiming to understand the conditions of possibility for experience itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Challenge of Metaphysical Cognition**: One of the central challenges that Kant highlights is the controversial status of metaphysical knowledge. Unlike mathematics and natural science, whose claims can be empirically verified or logically demonstrated, metaphysical propositions often seem speculative and are subject to dispute. Kant sees this as a problem of method and aims to establish a secure foundation for metaphysics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Synthetic A Priori Propositions**: Kant introduces the concept of synthetic a priori propositions as the key to unlocking the potential of metaphysics. These are propositions that are informative (synthetic) and yet knowable independently of experience (a priori). The possibility of such propositions underpins the scientific status of metaphysics, according to Kant, because they allow metaphysics to make substantive claims about the structure of reality without relying on empirical observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Aim of the Prolegomena**: Ultimately, the preamble sets the stage for the Prolegomena's main purpose: to explore whether metaphysics is possible as a science, and if so, how it can achieve a secure foundation. Kant seeks to demonstrate that metaphysical knowledge, properly understood, is both possible and necessary for a coherent understanding of both science and morality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Study\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding the Distinctions**: It's important for readers to grasp the distinctions Kant makes between different types of knowledge (empirical vs. a priori, analytic vs. synthetic) as these distinctions are foundational to his argument in the Prolegomena and his broader critical philosophy.\n",
    "- **The Role of Critique**: The Prolegomena can be seen as part of Kant's larger project of critique, aimed at examining the limits and conditions of human knowledge. Understanding this critical approach is key to engaging with Kant's philosophy.\n",
    "- **Engagement with Previous Metaphysics**: Kant's project involves a reevaluation of traditional metaphysical questions. Readers should be aware of the historical context of metaphysical inquiry, including the works of predecessors like Leibniz and Hume, to fully appreciate Kant's contributions.\n",
    "- **Relevance to Contemporary Philosophy**: The issues Kant raises about the possibility of metaphysical knowledge and its methods continue to be relevant in contemporary philosophical discussions. Considering the implications of Kant's arguments for current debates can enrich the study of the Prolegomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the \"Preamble on the Distinguishing Feature of All Metaphysical Cognition\" lays the foundational questions and challenges that Kant will address throughout the Prolegomena. It serves as an invitation to critically engage with the nature and limits of human knowledge, setting the stage for a profound exploration of metaphysical inquiry."

    "Fichte's approach to the Science of Knowing (Wissenschaftslehre) and his deliberate distinction from Kant's Critical Philosophy at the outset is both a foundational and strategic move. It reflects Fichte's intention to build upon and yet significantly diverge from Kantian premises. This move is not merely a critique but an expansion and a re-envisioning of the critical project, aiming to ground the entire structure of knowledge on the principles of self-consciousness. Your study, especially as it relates to editing your notebooks for a focused examination of Fichte in relation to Kant, seems poised to unearth and elucidate these nuanced philosophical transitions. Here are some suggestions and key areas of focus that might guide your exploration and editing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Fichte’s Differentia\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Consciousness as Foundational**: Fichte positions the I (the self or ego) and its self-assertion as the absolute starting point of philosophical inquiry. This contrasts with Kant, who, while emphasizing the importance of the subject in knowledge, does not make the subject itself the foundation of all reality. Highlight passages where Fichte elaborates on this foundational difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Active Nature of the Subject**: For Fichte, the I is not just a passive recipient of sensory data but actively structures its own experience and reality. This can be seen as an extension of Kant’s notion of the synthetic a priori, but with a more radical emphasis on the activity and autonomy of the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determination of the Boundaries of Science**: Reflecting on Fichte's assertion in §1 about the need to precisely determine the distinguishing features of a science, consider how Fichte seeks to delineate the boundaries of the Science of Knowing. This involves a critical examination of how knowledge is possible, what its limits are, and how it is fundamentally grounded in the I's self-determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing Your Notebooks with a Focus on Fichte’s Relation to Kant\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Comparisons and Contrasts**: As you go through your notes, specifically mark sections where Fichte directly addresses Kantian concepts (such as the distinctions between a priori and a posteriori knowledge, the nature of synthetic judgments, etc.) and how he proposes to move beyond them. This will help in creating a clear comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Passages Relating to Fichte**: Identify and annotate key passages where Fichte outlines his philosophical differentia from Kant. These passages will be crucial for understanding the evolution from Kant’s critical philosophy to Fichte’s foundational emphasis on self-consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thematic Organization**: Organize your notes thematically around core concepts such as self-consciousness, the nature of the subject, the active vs. passive role of the subject in knowledge, and the foundations of metaphysics. This will facilitate a structured discussion and comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Insights**: Wherever possible, include contextual insights into the philosophical and historical background that influenced Fichte’s thinking. Understanding the debates and ideas circulating at the time Fichte wrote can provide deeper insight into his motivations for distinguishing his work from Kant’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future Implications**: Consider the implications of Fichte’s Science of Knowing for later philosophical developments, especially in German Idealism (e.g., Schelling, Hegel). This broader perspective will enrich your study by situating Fichte within a larger philosophical narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a methodical approach to your study, focusing on these aspects, will not only clarify Fichte's philosophical innovations but also illuminate his critical engagement with Kant. This, in turn, will provide a rich foundation for understanding the progression of ideas that influenced the development of German Idealism and the enduring significance of Fichte’s work."

This approach not only honors Kant's meticulous style but also provides a structured foundation for understanding how Fichte diverges and builds upon Kant's ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"distinguishing feature\"\n",
    "- **Definition**: The unique characteristic that differentiates one body of knowledge (or science) from another.\n",
    "- **Kantian Context**: For Kant, the distinguishing features of various types of cognition (e.g., a priori vs. a posteriori, analytic vs. synthetic) are central to his critical philosophy. These distinctions help delineate the scope and limits of human understanding and the structure of metaphysical inquiry.\n",
    "- **Fichtean Extension**: Fichte’s emphasis on self-consciousness as the foundation of all knowledge can be seen as his \"distinguishing feature,\" setting his philosophy apart from Kant’s. This focus shifts the investigation from the nature of objects and their cognition to the active, generating role of the subject (the I).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"difference of the object\"\n",
    "- **Definition**: The differentiation based on what is being studied or known.\n",
    "- **Kantian Insight**: Kant differentiates between phenomena (objects as they appear to us) and noumena (things-in-themselves, which we cannot know directly). This distinction is crucial for understanding the limits of human cognition.\n",
    "- **Fichtean Perspective**: Fichte moves away from an object-centric view of knowledge to one that prioritizes the subjective processes that constitute the object for the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"source of cognition\"\n",
    "- **Definition**: The origin from which knowledge arises, such as sensory experience or rational thought.\n",
    "- **Kantian Division**: Kant divides knowledge into empirical (arising from experience) and a priori (independent of experience). This division is foundational to his epistemology.\n",
    "- **Fichtean Reinterpretation**: Fichte considers the self’s activity as the ultimate source of all cognition, arguing that the ego posits both itself and the non-ego (the object) through its own activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"type of cognition\"\n",
    "- **Definition**: The nature or mode of understanding, which can include empirical knowledge, rational knowledge, intuitive understanding, etc.\n",
    "- **Kantian Categorization**: Kant categorizes knowledge based on its relation to experience and logic (analytic vs. synthetic, a priori vs. a posteriori).\n",
    "- **Fichtean Approach**: Fichte focuses on the active, self-determining aspect of cognition, suggesting a type of knowledge that is both generated by and reflective of the self’s activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"several if not all of these things together\"\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: This phrase acknowledges the complexity and interrelatedness of factors that define a science. It suggests that the distinguishing feature of a science may not be reducible to a single criterion.\n",
    "- **Kantian Implication**: In Kant’s critical philosophy, the interplay between the object, source, and type of cognition is crucial for defining the boundaries and possibilities of metaphysical knowledge.\n",
    "- **Fichtean Implication**: Fichte’s system, while focusing on the activity of the self, also engages with these aspects, albeit in a radically redefined way that centers on the self’s creative capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes for the Study Guide with Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: This analysis highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach when studying Kant and Fichte. Understanding their philosophies requires engaging with epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical Vocabulary**: Building a critical vocabulary based on key terms and their nuanced meanings within Kantian and Fichtean philosophy is essential. This not only aids in comprehension but also in appreciating the subtleties of their arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Philosophical Evolution**: The transition from Kant to Fichte represents a significant evolution in German Idealism. Fichte's reorientation towards the subject's active role in constituting knowledge marks a departure from Kant’s more object-oriented framework, highlighting the dynamism of philosophical thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methodological Considerations**: Both Kant and Fichte emphasize the methodological underpinnings of philosophy. Understanding their approaches to defining the \"distinguishing feature\" of a science offers insights into their broader philosophical projects and the critical importance of methodology in philosophical inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contemporary Relevance**: The questions raised by Kant and Fichte about the sources, types, and objects of cognition remain relevant in contemporary philosophical discussions, especially in debates about the nature of consciousness, the structure of reality, and the limits of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "By delving into these key terms and phrases, your study guide will not only elucidate the foundational concepts of Kant and Fichte but also stimulate deeper reflection on the nature of philosophical inquiry itself."

Let's break down the key components for a deeper understanding and insights that could be added to your study guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"sources of metaphysical cognition\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Metaphysical cognition, unlike empirical sciences, must derive from sources beyond sensory experience. This distinction underlines the unique domain of metaphysics, which seeks to understand the principles that underlie and transcend empirical reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"cannot be empirical\"\n",
    "- **Insight**: By stating that the sources of metaphysics cannot be empirical, the passage underscores the Kantian notion that metaphysical knowledge must be founded on a priori principles—those that are universal and necessary, independent of empirical evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"principles of such cognition\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Includes both fundamental propositions and concepts. This indicates that metaphysics is built on a foundation that is both conceptual and propositional, emphasizing the role of pure reason in constructing its framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"must therefore never be taken from experience\"\n",
    "- **Insight**: This stipulation reinforces the distinction between metaphysical and empirical knowledge, highlighting the a priori nature of metaphysical cognition. It's a clear articulation of the Kantian view that true metaphysical insights cannot be derived from sensory experience but must originate from the inherent capacities of reason and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"not physical but metaphysical, i.e., lying beyond experience\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Distinguishes metaphysical knowledge from physical knowledge, emphasizing its concern with what lies beyond the empirical realm. This distinction is crucial for understanding the scope and ambition of metaphysical inquiry as it seeks to answer questions about the nature of reality, existence, and essence that are not answerable through empirical observation alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"neither outer experience... nor inner\"\n",
    "- **Insight**: Specifies that metaphysical knowledge is independent of both external sensory experience and internal psychological experience. This is a pivotal claim, as it sets metaphysical knowledge apart from the empirical sciences, including both physics and psychology, which rely on outer and inner experiences, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"cognition a priori, or from pure understanding and pure reason\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Affirms that the basis of metaphysical knowledge is a priori cognition, stemming from the faculties of understanding and reason in their purest forms. This emphasizes the role of innate structures of thought and conceptual analysis in metaphysics, as opposed to empirical or inductive reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes for the Study Guide with Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foundation of Metaphysics**: Highlight the importance of understanding the non-empirical, a priori foundation of metaphysical cognition as essential for engaging with both Kant's and Fichte's philosophies. This understanding is crucial for exploring the deeper questions of metaphysics that concern the nature of reality, causality, and the self.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methodological Implications**: Reflect on the methodological implications of metaphysical knowledge being grounded in pure understanding and reason. This approach requires a different set of tools than those used in empirical sciences—a focus on logical analysis, conceptual clarification, and argumentative rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distinction in Sources**: Emphasize the clear distinction between the sources of metaphysical and empirical cognition. This distinction is not only foundational for grasping the essence of metaphysical inquiry but also for understanding the critiques and developments that Fichte offers in relation to Kant's framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role of Pure Reason**: Discuss the role of pure reason in metaphysical inquiry, as highlighted in this passage. This discussion can lead to deeper explorations of the nature and limits of reason, a central theme in both Kant's and Fichte's philosophies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical Thinking and Metaphysics**: Encourage critical thinking about the claim that metaphysical principles cannot be derived from experience. This involves examining the arguments for and against this claim, as well as considering contemporary perspectives on the source and nature of metaphysical knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating these analyses and insights into your study guide, you'll provide a robust framework for understanding the foundational aspects of metaphysical cognition as conceived by Kant and further explored by Fichte. This will not only deepen the appreciation of their philosophical endeavors but also enhance the critical engagement with the core issues at the heart of metaphysical inquiry."

    "\n",
    "#### \"nothing to differentiate it from pure mathematics\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Both metaphysical cognition and pure mathematics are grounded in a priori knowledge, which could blur the lines between them if not for a crucial distinction. This remark points to the need for a clear differentiation based on the nature of their respective objects and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"pure philosophical cognition\"\n",
    "- **Insight**: Kant introduces the term \"pure philosophical cognition\" to distinguish the domain of metaphysics from that of mathematics. While both operate independently of empirical data, their goals, methods, and objects of study differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Critique of Pure Reason, pp. 712 f.\"\n",
    "- **Reference**: Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" elaborates on the distinctions between the uses of reason in mathematics and philosophy. This text is essential for understanding how Kant conceptualizes the boundaries and functions of different forms of a priori knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"distinction between these two types of use of reason\"\n",
    "- **Key Distinction**: The differentiation lies in the application and objectives of reason within each field. In mathematics, reason is applied to construct concepts and to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms in a strictly logical manner. In metaphysics, reason seeks to understand the conditions and structures underlying experience and existence itself, often engaging with concepts that are not amenable to mathematical formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes for the Study Guide with Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Pure Philosophical Cognition**: Emphasize the importance of grasping what Kant means by \"pure philosophical cognition\" as distinct from the empirical or the purely mathematical. This understanding is crucial for delving into metaphysics, which deals with the fundamental questions of existence, reality, and knowledge beyond what can be quantified or empirically verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Role of Reason in Metaphysics vs. Mathematics**: Discuss the different roles that reason plays in metaphysics and mathematics. While both rely on a priori principles, metaphysical inquiry aims at uncovering the conditions of possibility for knowledge and existence, whereas mathematics focuses on the construction and manipulation of abstract structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kant's Crucial Distinction**: Highlight Kant's effort to delineate the distinct domains of mathematics and philosophical cognition. Understanding this distinction is vital for appreciating the scope and limits of each discipline as outlined in the \"Critique of Pure Reason.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implications for Fichte’s Philosophy**: Reflect on how Fichte, building on Kant, may navigate these distinctions in his own philosophical system. Fichte's emphasis on the active, self-positing nature of the I or self-consciousness can be seen as an effort to further explore the domain of pure philosophical cognition, especially in terms of the foundational principles of knowledge and existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contemporary Relevance**: Consider the contemporary relevance of Kant's distinction between pure mathematics and pure philosophical cognition. In an age where the boundaries between disciplines are increasingly blurred, revisiting Kant's distinctions can provide valuable insights into the nature and limits of rational inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating these analyses and insights into your study guide, you will enrich the understanding of the unique nature of metaphysical cognition as distinct from mathematical reasoning.

    "\n",
    "#### \"judgments a priori\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Judgments a priori are those that are made independently of experience. In the context of metaphysics, these judgments are necessary because they aim to uncover the fundamental structures and conditions of reality that are not contingent on empirical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"origin... or... logical form\"\n",
    "- **Insight**: Kant suggests that judgments can originate from various sources and can be structured in different logical forms. However, these aspects are secondary to the content-based distinction that categorizes them as either analytic or synthetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"distinction... according to their content\"\n",
    "- **Key Point**: The crucial factor distinguishing analytic from synthetic judgments is their content and what they contribute to our knowledge. This distinction is essential for understanding the nature of metaphysical cognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"merely explicative\"\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Analytic judgments are characterized as explicative; they clarify or explicate the meaning of concepts without extending our knowledge beyond what is already contained in the subject of the judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"ampliative and augment the given cognition\"\n",
    "- **Insight**: Synthetic judgments, in contrast, are ampliative; they extend our knowledge by adding information not contained within the concepts being judged. This capacity to augment cognition is especially relevant to metaphysical inquiry, which seeks to expand our understanding of the nature of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"analytic judgments... synthetic\"\n",
    "- **Key Distinction**: This foundational distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is central to Kant's philosophy. Analytic judgments are tautological in nature, while synthetic judgments provide new knowledge and are crucial for the advancement of metaphysical cognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes for the Study Guide with Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Role of a Priori Judgments in Metaphysics**: Emphasize the necessity of a priori judgments in metaphysical cognition, as these are not reliant on empirical evidence but seek to establish the conditions and principles underlying empirical reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Analytic vs. Synthetic Judgments**: Clarify the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments, highlighting how this distinction is pivotal for Kant's critical project. Analytic judgments unpack what is already known, whereas synthetic judgments expand our understanding in significant ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance of Synthetic Judgments**: Discuss the special role of synthetic a priori judgments in metaphysical inquiry. These judgments are key to Kant's argument for how metaphysics can provide substantive knowledge about the world, beyond what is analytically contained within concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application to Fichte's Philosophy**: Reflect on how Fichte might engage with and build upon Kant's distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. Fichte's focus on the active nature of the self might be seen as an effort to explore the synthetic dimensions of self-consciousness and its role in generating knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contemporary Implications**: Consider the implications of Kant's distinction for contemporary philosophical and scientific debates. The distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments remains relevant for discussions about the nature of conceptual analysis, the structure of scientific theories, and the limits of knowledge.\n",

Kant reflects on the oversight of dogmatic philosophers who, by seeking the sources of metaphysical judgments solely within metaphysics rather than in the broader, pure laws of reason, failed to appreciate this fundamental division. This oversight led figures such as Wolf and Baumgarten to erroneously seek the foundation of inherently synthetic principles, like the principle of sufficient reason, within the principle of contradiction, which is analytic. Let's break down the key points and their implications for your study guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of the Analytic-Synthetic Division\n",

    "In this passage, Kant acknowledges John Locke's early hint at the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments within his \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\" Locke identified two sources of the connections in judgments: one based on identity or contradiction (analytic judgments) and the other on the existence of representations in a subject (synthetic judgments). However, Kant critiques Locke for the vagueness and lack of precision in his treatment of synthetic a priori cognition, suggesting that Locke's insights, while significant, were not sufficiently articulated to inspire further contemplation or systematic inquiry, even by thinkers like Hume. Kant emphasizes the importance of arriving at such distinctions through personal reflection, noting that once these principles are recognized in one's own thinking, they can be seen in the works of others, even if those authors were not explicitly aware of them.

    "In this passage, Kant poses a profound question regarding the possibility of metaphysics as a science. He imagines a scenario in which metaphysics could present itself as a conclusive, irrefutable body of knowledge, similar to how Euclid's works represent geometry. If such a definitive metaphysical science existed, it would render the question of its possibility moot, focusing instead on understanding its mechanisms and principles. However, Kant notes the unfortunate reality that reason has not achieved such clarity and consensus in metaphysics. Unlike geometry, which has Euclid's works as a canonical, definitive guide, metaphysics lacks a universally accepted, irrefutable text that could serve as the final word on its fundamental inquiries, such as the existence of a supreme being or the afterlife, based solely on pure reason.\n",

    "In this passage, Kant explores the historical context that led to the rise of skepticism, particularly in relation to metaphysics. He suggests that the repeated failures to establish metaphysics as a definitive science prompted a profound disillusionment, giving rise to skepticism—a mode of thinking where reason essentially turns against itself. This skepticism emerged not from a lack of inquiry into the natural world, but from introspective questioning of reason itself, which, unlike the empirical investigation of nature, relied on pre-existing, albeit limited, experiential knowledge. Metaphysics, according to Kant, remained a superficial layer of inquiry, constantly replenished yet never deeply understood or resolved, leading to a cycle of enthusiasm and disillusionment among philosophers.

He distinguishes among three types of propositions—analytic, synthetic a posteriori, and synthetic a priori—and explains that while the possibility of the first two types can be understood relatively easily, the latter poses a significant epistemological challenge. Analytic propositions are justified by the principle of contradiction, and synthetic a posteriori propositions are grounded in experience, which inherently involves synthesis of perceptions. The real puzzle for Kant lies in the synthetic a priori propositions, which cannot rely on the principle of contradiction for their justification and are not derived from experience.

The citation implies that just as the audience rejects what is unbelievable in art, so too should philosophers be wary of accepting claims in metaphysics that lack rigorous justification or that do not adequately address the fundamental question of how synthetic a priori knowledge is possible."

    "Kant outlines his approach to solving the problem of how synthetic a priori knowledge is possible by employing the analytic method. In this method, the existence of such knowledge is taken as a given, and the inquiry then moves backward from this premise to uncover the principles that make it possible. Kant identifies pure mathematics and pure natural science as the only two theoretical sciences capable of presenting objects in intuition and, potentially, containing a priori knowledge that can be verified through its correspondence with actual objects. This approach allows for an examination of a priori knowledge by starting from concrete instances where such knowledge is applied, thereby simplifying the task of tracing back to the foundational principles of its possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy contrasts with the synthetic method, where knowledge is built up from abstract concepts without direct reference to empirical instances.
