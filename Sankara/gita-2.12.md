## Philosophical Structure

### Triple Time Analysis
1. Past (अतीत)
   - न त्वेवाहं जातु नासम्
   - Negation of non-existence
   - Eternal presence revealed

2. Present (वर्तमान)

   - Through all apparent changes
   - Like space (वियदिव)

3. Future (भविष्यत्)
   - न चैव न भविष्यामः
   - Double negation important
   - Eternal continuation assured

### Key Technical Points

1. Space Analogy (वियदिव)
   - Unchanging through all changes
   - All-pervading nature
   - Beyond temporal sequence

2. Body vs Self Distinction
   - देहभेदानुवृत्त्या बहुवचनम्
   - Plurality only at body level
   - Unity of consciousness maintained

3. Triple Negation Structure
   - न त्वेव... न... न
   - Dissolves temporal limitations
   - Reveals eternal presence
