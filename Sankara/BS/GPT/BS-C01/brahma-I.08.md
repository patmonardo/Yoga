### **Section 1: Introduction and Sutra**
**Sanskrit:**
कुतश्च न प्रधानं सच्छब्दवाच्यम् ? —
हेयत्वावचनाच्च ॥ ८ ॥

**Transliteration:**
Kutaśca na pradhānaṁ sacchabdavācyam? —
Heyatvāvacanācca || 8 ||

**English Translation:**
Why is *Pradhāna* (the insentient principle) not denoted by the term *sat* (existence)?
Because it is not taught as something to be rejected (*heyatvam*). || 8 ||

### **Section 2: The Logical Argument on Rejection**
**Sanskrit:**
यद्यनात्मैव प्रधानं सच्छब्दवाच्यम् ‘स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि’ इतीहोपदिष्टं स्यात्; स तदुपदेशश्रवणादनात्मज्ञतया तन्निष्ठो मा भूदिति, मुख्यमात्मानमुपदिदिक्षु शास्त्रं तस्य हेयत्वं ब्रूयात्।

**Transliteration:**
Yadyanātmaiva pradhānaṁ sacchabdavācyam ‘sa ātmā tattvamasi’ itīhopadiṣṭaṁ syāt; sa tadupadeśaśravaṇādanātmajñatayā tanniṣṭho mā bhūditi, mukhyamātmānamupadidiśu śāstraṁ tasya heyatvaṁ brūyāt.

**English Translation:**
If *Pradhāna*, being non-self (*anātma*), were referred to as *sat* in the statement "Sa Ātmā Tattvamasi" ("That is the Self, You Are That"), the Śāstra (scripture) would direct the seeker to reject it as non-self. In its effort to teach the true Self, the Śāstra would indicate that *Pradhāna* is to be discarded.

### **Section 3: The Arundhatī Example**
**Sanskrit:**
यथारुन्धतीं दिदर्शयिषुस्तत्समीपस्थां स्थूलां ताराममुख्यां प्रथममरुन्धतीति ग्राहयित्वा, तां प्रत्याख्याय, पश्चादरुन्धतीमेव ग्राहयति; तद्वन्नायमात्मेति ब्रूयात्।

**Transliteration:**
Yathāruṇdhatīṁ didarśayiṣu statsamīpasthāṁ sthūlāṁ tārāmamukhyāṁ prathamamaruṇdhatīti grāhayitvā, tāṁ pratyākhyāya, paścādaruṇdhatīmeva grāhayati; tadvannāyamātmāmeti brūyāt.

**English Translation:**
Just as someone pointing to the star *Arundhatī* first identifies a nearby, gross, non-principal star as *Arundhatī*, only to later reject it and correctly show the true *Arundhatī*, similarly, the Śāstra would say, "This is not the Self" before revealing the true Self.

### **Section 4: The Absence of Rejection**
**Sanskrit:**
न चैवमवोचत्। सन्मात्रात्मावगतिनिष्ठैव हि षष्ठप्रपाठकपरिसमाप्तिर्दृश्यते।

**Transliteration:**
Na caivamavocat. Sanmātrātmāvagatinisṭhaiva hi ṣaṣṭhaprapāṭhakaparisamāptirdṛśyate.

**English Translation:**
However, the Śāstra does not adopt such a method. Instead, the sixth chapter concludes with the realization of the Self as pure *sat* (existence).

### **Section 5: Contradiction to the Śāstra's Declaration**
**Sanskrit:**
चशब्दः प्रतिज्ञाविरोधाभ्युच्चयप्रदर्शनार्थः। सत्यपि हेयत्ववचने प्रतिज्ञाविरोधः प्रसज्येत।

**Transliteration:**
Caśabdaḥ pratijñāvirodhābhyuccayapradarśanārthaḥ. Satyapi heyatvavacane pratijñāvirodhaḥ prasajyeta.

**English Translation:**
The particle *ca* in the sutra indicates the inclusion of contradictions. If the Śāstra had taught *Pradhāna* as something to be rejected, it would contradict its declaration that "by knowing the cause, everything is known."

---

### **Section 6: The Śruti Evidence**
**Sanskrit:**
कारणविज्ञानाद्धि सर्वं विज्ञातमिति प्रतिज्ञातम् — ‘उत तमादेशमप्राक्ष्यो येनाश्रुतꣳ श्रुतं भवत्यमतं मतमविज्ञातं विज्ञातमिति; कथं नु भगवः स आदेशो भवतीति’ (छा. उ. ६।१।३); ‘यथा सोम्यैकेन मृत्पिण्डेन सर्वं मृन्मयं विज्ञातं स्याद्वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयं मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम्’ (छा. उ. ६।१।४) ‘एवं सोम्य स आदेशो भवति’ (छा. उ. ६।१।६) इति वाक्योपक्रमे श्रवणात्।

**Transliteration:**
Kāraṇavijñānāddhi sarvaṁ vijñātamiti pratijñātam — ‘Uta tamādeśamaprākṣyo yenāśrutaṁ śrutaṁ bhavatyamataṁ matamavijñātaṁ vijñātamiti; kathaṁ nu bhagavaḥ sa ādeśo bhavatīti’ (Chā. U. 6.1.3); ‘Yathā somyaikena mṛtpinḍena sarvaṁ mṛnmayaṁ vijñātaṁ syādvācārambhaṇaṁ vikāro nāmadheyaṁ mṛttiketyeva satyam’ (Chā. U. 6.1.4) ‘Evaṁ somya sa ādeśo bhavati’ (Chā. U. 6.1.6) iti vākyopakrame śravaṇāt.

**English Translation:**
It has been declared: "By knowing the cause, everything is known." The Śruti (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.3-6) explains this with examples such as knowing all clay objects by knowing clay.

### **Section 7: Logical Conclusion**
**Sanskrit:**
न च सच्छब्दवाच्ये प्रधाने भोग्यवर्गकारणे हेयत्वेनाहेयत्वेन वा विज्ञाते भोक्तृवर्गो विज्ञातो भवति, अप्रधानविकारत्वाद्भोक्तृवर्गस्य। तस्मान्न प्रधानं सच्छब्दवाच्यम् ॥ ८ ॥

**Transliteration:**
Na ca sacchabdavācye pradhāne bhogyavargakāraṇe heyatvenāheyatvena vā vijñāte bhoktṛvargo vijñāto bhavati, apradhānavikāratvādbhoktṛvargasya. Tasmānna pradhānaṁ sacchabdavācyam. || 8 ||

**English Translation:**
If *Pradhāna* were the referent of *sat* and the cause of objects of enjoyment (*bhogya*), knowing it would not reveal the enjoyer (*bhoktṛ*), as the enjoyer is not a transformation of *Pradhāna*. Therefore, *Pradhāna* is not the entity referred to as *sat*.

### Complete Analysis of Sutra 8: "हेयत्वावचनाच्च"

The sutra refutes the claim that *Pradhāna* is the entity denoted by the term *sat* (existence) in Vedānta texts. Below is an analysis of all the sections in the context of Śaṅkara's commentary.

---

### **Section 1: Introduction and Sutra**
**Key Idea:**
The sutra begins by addressing the question: "Why is *Pradhāna* not referred to by the term *sat*?" It provides a succinct answer: because the Śruti does not mention *Pradhāna* as something to be rejected (*heyatva*).

**Analysis:**
The Śruti aims to reveal the ultimate Self (*Ātman*) through the term *sat*. If *Pradhāna* were implied, it would contradict the goal of Vedānta, which seeks to establish the non-rejectable nature of the Self as the ultimate reality. Śaṅkara emphasizes that the Śruti does not direct the seeker to discard *Pradhāna* before realizing the Self, further confirming that *Pradhāna* cannot be the referent of *sat*.

---

### **Section 2: The Logical Argument on Rejection**
**Key Idea:**
If *Pradhāna* were identified as *sat*, the scripture would direct the seeker to reject it as non-self (*anātman*) before realizing the true Self.

**Analysis:**
Śaṅkara explains that Vedānta does not treat the realization of *Ātman* like discarding a proximate object to point to a distant one, as in the Arundhatī example (discussed in the next section). If *Pradhāna* were *anātman*, the scripture would make this clear to avoid confusion for the seeker.

---

### **Section 3: The Arundhatī Example**
**Key Idea:**
The Śruti does not use an indirect teaching method (like the Arundhatī example) to denote *sat*.

**Analysis:**
The Arundhatī example illustrates a stepwise method of teaching: pointing to an intermediate object (a gross star) before leading to the final object (the subtle star Arundhatī). Śaṅkara notes that the Śruti does not follow this pattern for *sat* or the Self. The scriptures directly reveal the Self without any intermediary, confirming that *Pradhāna* is not implied.

---

### **Section 4: The Absence of Rejection**
**Key Idea:**
Vedānta does not direct the seeker to reject anything prior to the realization of *sat*.

**Analysis:**
The conclusion of the sixth chapter of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad highlights the realization of the Self as pure *sat*. There is no indication that the seeker must first discard *Pradhāna*. This supports the claim that *Pradhāna* is not referred to as *sat*.

---

### **Section 5: Contradiction to the Śāstra's Declaration**
**Key Idea:**
Identifying *Pradhāna* as *sat* would contradict the Vedāntic teaching.

**Analysis:**
The Śruti declares that by knowing the cause (*sat*), everything is known. If *Pradhāna*, which is merely the material cause (*bhogya-varga-kāraṇa*), were considered *sat*, this declaration would fail, as knowing *Pradhāna* would not reveal the enjoyer (*bhoktṛ*).

---

### **Section 6: The Śruti Evidence**
**Key Idea:**
Śruti examples confirm that *sat* refers to a unified, all-encompassing reality.

**Analysis:**
The Chāndogya Upaniṣad uses examples like clay and its products to illustrate that knowing the cause (clay) leads to knowledge of all its effects (pots, jars, etc.). However, *Pradhāna* cannot fulfill this role because it is not the substratum of the enjoyer (*bhoktṛ*), nor can it explain the ultimate unity of all existence.

---

### **Section 7: Logical Conclusion**
**Key Idea:**
*Pradhāna* cannot be the referent of *sat* because it does not satisfy the conditions of Vedāntic teachings.

**Analysis:**
The enjoyer (*bhoktṛ*) and the objects of enjoyment (*bhogya*) cannot both arise from *Pradhāna*. The Śruti’s declaration that the cause is non-rejectable (*aheyam*) and leads to the realization of everything further invalidates the claim that *Pradhāna* is *sat*. Therefore, *Pradhāna* is excluded as the referent of *sat*.

---

### Summary of the Sutra's Argument
1. *Pradhāna* cannot be *sat* because it is not taught as something to be rejected before realizing the Self.
2. Vedānta does not follow the indirect teaching method seen in the Arundhatī example.
3. The Śruti emphasizes the direct realization of *sat* as the Self, leaving no room for intermediary entities like *Pradhāna*.
4. Identifying *Pradhāna* as *sat* would contradict the Upaniṣadic declaration of the Self as the cause and essence of all.
5. The logical framework and the Śruti examples confirm that *sat* refers to a non-rejectable, unified, conscious reality, not the insentient *Pradhāna*.

This sutra solidifies the Vedāntic rejection of *Pradhāna* as the ultimate cause, paving the way for deeper discussions of the Self as *sat*.
