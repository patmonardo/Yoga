<p><strong>Key Sanskrit Excerpt:</strong> &gt; <strong>“साङ्ख्याः प्रधानं त्रिगुणमचेतनं स्वतन्त्रं जगतः कारणमिति मन्यमाना आहुः…”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> - Śaṅkara sets the stage for a debate between Vedānta and Sāṅkhya. - <strong>Sāṅkhya’s Viewpoint:</strong> - The world originates from <em>Pradhāna</em> (unmanifest matter), which is independent, unconscious, and constituted of three guṇas (sattva, rajas, tamas). - Vedāntic statements referring to Brahman as the cause of creation can be interpreted as referring to <em>Pradhāna</em>. - <em>Pradhāna</em> is claimed to possess “omniscience” in an indirect sense through its association with the <em>sattva</em> guṇa, which is the basis of knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objections Raised by Sāṅkhyans:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Pradhāna</em> is capable of transformation and can thus serve as a material cause (like clay for pots).</li>
<li>Brahman, as a non-composite, singular entity, cannot act as a material cause.</li>
<li>Brahman, being devoid of a body and sensory organs, cannot possess direct knowledge or omniscience.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Śaṅkara’s Preliminary Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Pradhāna</em> interpretation fails to align with Vedāntic teachings, which consistently describe Brahman as conscious and omniscient, not unconscious.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Īkṣate (Seeing):</strong>

<li>The Upaniṣads describe Brahman as the cause of creation through conscious deliberation (<em>īkṣate</em> - “It saw” or “It willed”).</li>
<li>Example from <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em>: <em>“Sa aikṣata—tadātmānam akuruta”</em> (“It saw, and it created itself”).</li>

<ul>
<li>Śruti texts explicitly refer to a conscious entity, not an unconscious principle like <em>Pradhāna</em>.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Consciousness as a Defining Attribute:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brahman’s ability to “see” (<em>īkṣate</em>) reflects deliberate, conscious activity.</li>
<li>This conscious aspect is irreconcilable with <em>Pradhāna</em>, which is inherently unconscious (<em>acetana</em>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scriptural Specificity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Upaniṣads explicitly use terms like <em>Brahman</em> or <em>Ātman</em>, which denote consciousness, not a vague material cause.</li>
<li><em>Pradhāna</em> is not even implicitly supported by the Śruti.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Causation and Deliberation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The act of creation as described in Vedānta involves intentionality and knowledge, which only a conscious entity can possess.</li>
<li><em>Pradhāna</em>, being inert, cannot engage in intentional deliberation or creation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Sāṅkhya’s Omniscience Claim:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Pradhāna</em> cannot be “omniscient” merely by association with <em>sattva</em>. Omniscience requires a self-aware entity, which <em>Pradhāna</em> lacks.</li>

<p>Śaṅkara opens his critique by outright rejecting the Sāṅkhya concept of <em>Pradhāna</em> as the cause of the universe. His primary argument hinges on the fact that <em>Pradhāna</em> is not supported by the Śruti (<em>aśabdam</em> - “unscriptural”) and is therefore inadmissible within the framework of Vedānta.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Rejection of Pradhāna:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara unequivocally states that <em>Pradhāna</em> cannot be the universal cause as it is an unconscious entity (<em>acetana</em>).</li>
<li>Vedāntic texts describe the cause of the universe as conscious and deliberate, attributes <em>Pradhāna</em> lacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aśabdam - Unsanctioned by Śruti:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara highlights that <em>Pradhāna</em> does not find any mention or endorsement in the authoritative texts of Vedānta (the Śruti).</li>
<li>This directly disqualifies it as a valid concept within Vedāntic philosophy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scriptural Authority in Vedānta:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara emphasizes that Vedāntic doctrines must be rooted in Śruti.</li>
<li>Any concept or principle that deviates from Śruti, such as <em>Pradhāna</em>, is inadmissible.</li>

<li><strong>Primacy of Consciousness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vedānta establishes consciousness as the fundamental basis of reality and causation, whereas Sāṅkhya’s <em>Pradhāna</em> is inert and unconscious.</li>
<li>The conscious nature of the cause is essential for intentional creation, which <em>Pradhāna</em> cannot provide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Authority of Śruti:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara reinforces the idea that Śruti is the ultimate pramāṇa (source of valid knowledge) in Vedānta.</li>
<li>Philosophical speculations, like those of the Sāṅkhyas, are secondary and cannot override scriptural authority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vedāntic Exclusivity:</strong>

<p>In this section, Śaṅkara begins his scriptural defense against the Sāṅkhya view by emphasizing the concept of <em>īkṣaṇa</em> (seeing or willing) as described in the Upaniṣads. This <em>īkṣaṇa</em> signifies deliberate, conscious activity, which aligns with Brahman as the ultimate cause of the universe and directly opposes the inert, unconscious <em>Pradhāna</em> of Sāṅkhya.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-points-of-analysis-1"><strong>Key Points of Analysis</strong></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Scriptural Affirmation of Consciousness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara highlights the act of “seeing” (<em>īkṣaṇa</em>), explicitly mentioned in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em>:
<ul>
<li><em>“Tad aikṣata, bahu syām prajāyeya”</em> (“It saw, let me become many, let me procreate”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This indicates that the cause of the universe possesses consciousness and intentionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Context of the Universe’s Creation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> describes the pre-creation state as <em>sat</em> (existence) and establishes it as the substratum of all names and forms (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>).</li>
<li>The process of creation begins with <em>īkṣaṇa</em>—a deliberate act of seeing and willing by Brahman, the conscious cause.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deliberation as Evidence of Omniscience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The act of <em>īkṣaṇa</em> suggests omniscience, as creation is based on precise knowledge and intention.</li>
<li>This refutes the Sāṅkhya claim that an unconscious <em>Pradhāna</em> could function as the cause of the universe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Contrast with Pradhāna:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Pradhāna</em> is inert and devoid of agency, rendering it incapable of performing a deliberate action like <em>īkṣaṇa</em>.</li>
<li>Brahman’s consciousness is necessary for the creation of a purposeful and orderly universe.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="philosophical-implications-2"><strong>Philosophical Implications</strong></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Causation Requires Consciousness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deliberation (<em>īkṣaṇa</em>) implies a conscious and intelligent cause, ruling out unconscious principles like <em>Pradhāna</em>.</li>
<li>This supports the Vedāntic view of Brahman as the material and efficient cause of the universe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Authority of Śruti:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara uses direct scriptural references to establish that Vedānta unequivocally describes a conscious creator.</li>
<li>Any interpretation that conflicts with the Śruti (such as <em>Pradhāna</em>) is dismissed as invalid.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intentionality in Creation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The act of <em>īkṣaṇa</em> signifies that creation is not random or mechanical but intentional and purposeful, aligning with Brahman’s omniscience and omnipotence.</li>

<section id="conclusion-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-1"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Section 2 further dismantles the Sāṅkhya argument by demonstrating that the Upaniṣads explicitly describe a conscious and intentional creator. Śaṅkara effectively establishes that <em>Pradhāna</em> is incompatible with the Vedāntic framework of creation as deliberate and purposeful.</p>

Śaṅkara also draws upon additional scriptural references to reinforce this interpretation and to highlight Brahman as the sole conscious cause of creation.</p>

<section id="key-points-of-analysis-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-points-of-analysis-2"><strong>Key Points of Analysis</strong></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pre-Creation State:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The universe, before differentiation into <em>nāma-rūpa</em> (names and forms), is described as <em>sat</em> (pure existence).</li>
<li>This <em>sat</em> is identified as Brahman, the ultimate reality, which serves as the material and efficient cause of the universe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Deliberation in Creation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara underscores that creation is preceded by an act of deliberate will (<em>īkṣaṇa</em>), as seen in:
<ul>
<li><em>“Tad aikṣata bahu syām prajāyeya”</em> – “It saw, let me become many, let me procreate.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This conscious act differentiates Brahman from <em>Pradhāna</em>, which is inert and incapable of intention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scriptural Confirmation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Aitareya Upaniṣad</em> is cited:
<ul>
<li><em>“Ātmā vā idam eka evāgra āsīt. Na anyat kiñcana miṣat.”</em> (“The self alone existed in the beginning, nothing else whatsoever moved.”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This affirms Brahman as the singular, conscious reality prior to creation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nature of Transformation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara interprets the act of creation as a transformation of <em>sat</em> into the manifest universe.</li>
<li>The undifferentiated reality becomes differentiated through the intentionality of Brahman, further disproving the idea of an inert cause like <em>Pradhāna</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Consciousness as a Prerequisite for Causation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The act of creation (<em>īkṣaṇa</em>) necessitates a conscious entity, rejecting the unconscious nature of <em>Pradhāna</em>.</li>
<li>Brahman, being self-aware and omniscient, fulfills this requirement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Non-Random Creation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The process of creation described in the Upaniṣads reflects order, deliberation, and purpose, aligning with Brahman’s omniscient and omnipotent nature.</li>

<section id="conclusion-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Section 3 reinforces Śaṅkara’s argument by demonstrating how the Upaniṣads consistently describe Brahman as the conscious substratum of the universe.

<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara explains that <em>īkṣateḥ</em> is used in its verbal sense, indicating an action of seeing or deliberation.</li>
<li>It is analogous to terms like <em>yajate</em> (performs a sacrifice), which describe active processes, not just nominal or abstract concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Refutation of Non-Intentional Interpretation:</strong>

<li>Śaṅkara directly challenges this by stating that in the state of <em>guṇa-sāmya</em>, all three <em>guṇas</em> are in balance, and none, including <em>sattva</em>, can dominate to produce knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Equilibrium of <em>Guṇas</em> in <em>Pradhāna</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the unmanifest state of <em>Pradhāna</em>, the three <em>guṇas</em>—<em>sattva</em> (knowledge), <em>rajas</em> (activity), and <em>tamas</em> (inertia)—exist in perfect balance, preventing the manifestation of any functional property.</li>

<li><strong>Analogy to Fire and Iron:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sāṅkhya suggests that <em>Pradhāna’s</em> omniscience can be explained through analogy, such as iron gaining the ability to burn due to contact with fire.</li>
<li>Śaṅkara rejects this analogy, arguing that even if <em>Pradhāna</em> were to act as an instrument, there must still be an external conscious principle (akin to fire) imparting the capacity to know.

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Incompatibility with Vedānta:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara outright rejects the notion that <em>Pradhāna</em> is a legitimate cause of the universe. The lack of any mention or support for <em>Pradhāna</em> in the Vedas renders it incompatible with Vedāntic teachings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Argument from Scriptural Authority (<em>śabda-pramāṇa</em>):</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Pradhāna</em> is described as <em>aśabda</em> (not mentioned in the Vedas), which eliminates it from consideration as the ultimate cause. In Vedānta, scriptural testimony is the highest authority for metaphysical truths, particularly regarding causation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dependency on <em>īksitṛtvam</em> (Seeing/Knowledge):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara emphasizes that any proposed cause must align with the Upaniṣadic descriptions of <em>īksitṛtvam</em> (intentionality or knowledge). The Upaniṣads repeatedly attribute this characteristic to Brahman, not to an inert principle like <em>Pradhāna</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Incompatibility of Inertness with Knowledge:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Pradhāna</em> is unconscious (<em>acetana</em>), and as such, it cannot possess the capacity for intention (<em>īksitṛtvam</em>), which is a defining characteristic of the cause of creation as per the Vedic texts.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Scriptural Exclusivity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara asserts that Vedāntic cosmology is rooted in the Vedas, and any theory unsupported by scriptural authority—no matter how logically constructed—cannot be accepted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Causality and Consciousness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate cause, according to Vedānta, must be conscious and intentional. This directly challenges the Sāṅkhya view, which postulates an inert, unconscious principle as the ultimate cause.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Establishing Brahman as the Cause:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By refuting <em>Pradhāna</em> on the grounds of <em>aśabdatva</em> and <em>īksitṛtvam</em>, Śaṅkara strengthens the case for Brahman as the conscious, omniscient, and scripturally endorsed cause of the universe.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Brahman’s Omniscience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara affirms that Brahman’s knowledge is eternal, direct, and self-sufficient. Unlike embodied beings who require senses or mind to perceive, Brahman’s knowledge is intrinsic to its nature and does not depend on external instruments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nature of Knowledge in Creation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <em>īksitṛtvam</em> (seeing or knowing) attributed to Brahman in the Upaniṣads refers to the deliberate intention behind creation. Brahman’s knowledge of names and forms (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>) before their manifestation is described as intuitive and self-established.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Undifferentiated Names and Forms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Before creation, names and forms exist in an unmanifested, indeterminate state (<em>tattva-anyatva-abhyām-anirvacanīya</em>). Brahman, through its omniscience, comprehends these and brings them into manifestation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Comparison with Yogins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara briefly mentions that even yogins, through meditative disciplines, can achieve knowledge of past and future objects. If this is possible for limited beings like yogins, it is far more natural for Brahman, the eternal, omniscient cause of all.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>No Need for External Aids:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara highlights that unlike embodied beings who require instruments for perception, Brahman does not rely on organs or external aids. Brahman’s knowledge is inherent and eternal, making it uniquely qualified as the cause of the universe.</li>

<li><strong>Refinement of <em>īksitṛtvam</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brahman’s <em>īksitṛtvam</em> is not dependent on material interaction but arises from its nature as pure consciousness. This establishes Brahman’s capacity for intentional creation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vedāntic Causality:</strong>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Inert Nature of <em>Pradhāna</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara underscores that <em>Pradhāna</em> is inherently unconscious (<em>acetana</em>). Knowledge or omniscience (<em>sarvajñatva</em>) cannot arise in something devoid of consciousness, regardless of the dominance of sattva.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of Sattva-Driven Knowledge in Equilibrium:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Sāṅkhya doctrine posits that the three guṇas are in perfect equilibrium during the <em>Pradhāna</em> state. Śaṅkara argues that under such conditions, no functional activity, including the production of knowledge through sattva, is possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dependence on Conscious Witness (<em>sākṣitva</em>):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sāṅkhyas suggest that the knowledge attributed to <em>Pradhāna</em> is due to a witnessing entity (<em>sākṣin</em>), such as puruṣa. Śaṅkara refutes this by asserting that the conscious witness itself must be acknowledged as the cause of knowledge, not inert <em>Pradhāna</em>. This undermines the Sāṅkhya claim that <em>Pradhāna</em> is omniscient.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Analogies with Yogins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sāṅkhyas argue that just as yogins achieve omniscience through the refinement of sattva, so does <em>Pradhāna</em>. Śaṅkara rejects this by noting that yogins are conscious beings and thus fundamentally different from inert <em>Pradhāna</em>. Consciousness is a prerequisite for omniscience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brahman as the True Omniscient Cause:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If a conscious witness (<em>sākṣin</em>) is required to attribute omniscience to <em>Pradhāna</em>, Śaṅkara asserts that the witness itself—Brahman—should be acknowledged as the ultimate cause of the universe.</li>

<li><strong>Invalidity of Sāṅkhya’s Analogies:</strong>

<li><strong>Sāṅkhya’s Proposed Dependency on a Witness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sāṅkhyas propose that <em>Pradhāna</em> may acquire the quality of deliberation or knowledge through the presence of a conscious witness (<em>sākṣin</em>), akin to how an iron ball acquires the property of burning when heated by fire.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Śaṅkara’s Counterargument:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara argues that if <em>Pradhāna’s</em> <em>īksitṛtvam</em> is dependent on an external conscious principle, then that conscious principle—Brahman—must itself be acknowledged as the ultimate cause.</li>
<li>The analogy of the iron ball acquiring heat from fire does not hold because the active property of burning ultimately belongs to fire, not the iron ball. Similarly, the deliberative power cannot be attributed to inert <em>Pradhāna</em> but must rest with the conscious Brahman.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement of Brahman’s Primacy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara emphasizes that Brahman, being inherently conscious and omniscient, requires no external aid to deliberate or act. In contrast, <em>Pradhāna</em> lacks intrinsic consciousness and cannot independently serve as a cause.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rejecting Sāṅkhya’s Attribution of Omniscience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara dismantles the Sāṅkhya assertion that <em>Pradhāna</em> can exhibit omniscience (<em>sarvajñatva</em>) by showing that this would be a derived property and not intrinsic to its nature. Such derived qualities only strengthen Brahman’s position as the ultimate cause.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consciousness as Primary:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara underscores that causation inherently requires agency, which is a feature of consciousness. This principle invalidates Sāṅkhya’s reliance on an inert entity like <em>Pradhāna</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Sāṅkhya’s Objection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Sāṅkhyas claim that Brahman, being eternally endowed with knowledge, cannot have deliberate knowledge of specific objects because this would imply dependence on external stimuli or actions, negating its independence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Śaṅkara’s Refutation of Non-Agency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara questions the logical basis of this objection: how can eternal knowledge (<em>nitya-jñāna</em>) diminish Brahman’s omniscience? He argues that Brahman’s eternal knowledge does not require external interaction to become aware of objects—it inherently encompasses all knowledge at all times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Misconception of Anitya-Jñāna:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara points out that attributing impermanence (<em>anitya-jñāna</em>) to Brahman, as Sāṅkhyas suggest, would lead to contradictions. If Brahman’s knowledge were intermittent, there would be times when Brahman is not omniscient, which violates its definition as <em>sarvajña</em> (all-knowing).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Eternal Knowledge Implies Omniscience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara emphasizes that the very nature of eternal knowledge ensures omniscience. Brahman’s knowledge is not like human knowledge, which depends on perception, inference, or interaction. Instead, Brahman’s eternal consciousness illuminates all objects simultaneously without requiring a sequential process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Freedom and Agency in Eternal Knowledge:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brahman’s omniscience does not imply mechanical determinism or lack of freedom. Instead, its eternal knowledge operates independently of external conditions or limitations, underscoring its ultimate supremacy.</li>

<li><strong>Refuting Sequential Knowledge:</strong>

<li><strong>Sāṅkhya’s Argument:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sāṅkhyas claim that Brahman, without a body, mind, or senses, cannot perform cognitive acts such as deliberation (<em>īkṣaṇa</em>) or knowledge acquisition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Śaṅkara’s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara asserts that Brahman does not rely on external instruments for knowledge. Unlike samsārins, whose knowledge is mediated by sensory and mental faculties, Brahman’s knowledge is direct, independent, and eternal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Illusory Attribution of Samsāric Qualities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara explains that the perception of samsāric attributes in Brahman arises from the association with <em>upādhis</em> (limiting adjuncts). Just as space appears divided by pots and other objects but remains indivisible, Brahman appears as a samsāric entity due to ignorance (<em>avidyā</em>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analogy of Space and Pots:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara uses the analogy of space and pots to illustrate how the association with <em>upādhis</em> creates the illusion of division or limitation. Similarly, Brahman, associated with body-mind complexes, seems samsāric but remains unaffected and indivisible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scriptural Support for Brahman’s Independence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara cites Upaniṣadic verses to emphasize Brahman’s independent nature:
<ul>
<li><em>“न तस्य कार्यं करणं च विद्यते … परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च”</em> (श्वे. उ. ६ । ८): Brahman’s knowledge and actions are innate and do not depend on external instruments.</li>
<li><em>“अपाणिपादो जवनो ग्रहीता पश्यत्यचक्षुः स शृणोत्यकर्णः”</em> (श्वे. उ. ३ । १९): Brahman perceives and acts without physical organs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reaffirming Brahman’s Non-Dependency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unlike samsārins, who depend on sensory and cognitive tools for knowledge and action, Brahman’s omniscience arises naturally from its essence. Ignorance (<em>avidyā</em>) causes people to falsely attribute samsāric dependency to Brahman.</li>

<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara cites Upaniṣadic passages like <em>“Tadaikṣata bahu syāṁ prajāyeya”</em> (Chā. Up. 6.2.3) to highlight that creation arises from an intelligent principle capable of deliberation. This excludes the inert Pradhāna of Sāṅkhya philosophy.</li>

<li><strong>Rejection of Pradhāna as the Cause:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Scriptural Basis:</strong> Pradhāna is not mentioned in authoritative scriptures (<em>aśabdam</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Incapability for Deliberation:</strong> An unconscious entity like Pradhāna cannot engage in purposeful acts such as creation.</li>
<li><strong>Dependence on External Sākṣin:</strong> If Pradhāna’s activity is attributed to a witnessing consciousness, then that consciousness—Brahman—becomes the true cause.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brahman as an Independent Cause:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brahman is described as omniscient and omnipotent (<em>sarvajña, sarvaśakti</em>), qualities derived from its essential nature rather than external factors like a body or mind.</li>
<li>Brahman’s knowledge and power are eternal, unconditioned, and not mediated by instruments, unlike human cognition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Illusory Attribution of Samsāric Characteristics to Brahman:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara addresses misconceptions arising from associating Brahman with limiting adjuncts (<em>upādhis</em>). Just as space appears divided by pots, Brahman appears samsāric due to ignorance (<em>avidyā</em>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Independent Omniscience of Brahman:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brahman’s omniscience is independent and eternal, unlike samsāric beings whose knowledge is mediated by body and mind. Śaṅkara uses scriptural support (e.g., <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em>) to affirm that Brahman acts without dependency on instruments.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Vedāntic Supremacy Over Sāṅkhya:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Śaṅkara underscores that Vedāntic Brahman, as a sentient and self-sufficient cause, is logically and scripturally superior to the inert, non-deliberative Pradhāna.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resolution of Apparent Paradoxes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brahman’s deliberation (<em>īkṣaṇa</em>) before creation does not imply samsāric qualities because it operates beyond bodily constraints.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advaita Perspective:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Misconceptions about Brahman’s dependence arise due to <em>avidyā</em>. True knowledge dispels this ignorance, revealing Brahman as the only reality beyond creation, maintenance, and dissolution.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-significance"><strong>Concluding Significance</strong></h3>
<p>Sutra 5 firmly establishes Brahman as the sole intelligent cause of the universe, refuting Pradhāna’s claim to causality. Śaṅkara’s exhaustive commentary sets the stage for further debates with other schools while affirming the Vedāntic view of an omniscient, independent Brahman as the foundation of all existence.</p>
<p>Would you like to proceed to Sutra 6 or revisit any key arguments?</p>
