##### Sanskrit
**Sutra:**
`नेतरोऽनुपपत्तेः ॥ १६ ॥`

**Bhāṣya:**
`इतश्चानन्दमयः पर एवात्मा, नेतरः; इतर ईश्वरादन्यः संसारी जीव इत्यर्थः । न जीव आनन्दमयशब्देनाभिधीयते । कस्मात् ? अनुपपत्तेः । आनन्दमयं हि प्रकृत्य श्रूयते — ‘सोऽकामयत । बहु स्यां प्रजायेयेति । स तपोऽतप्यत । स तपस्तप्त्वा । इदꣳ सर्वमसृजत । यदिदं किञ्च’ (तै. उ. २ । ६ । १) इति । तत्र प्राक्शरीराद्युत्पत्तेरभिध्यानम् , सृज्यमानानां च विकाराणां स्रष्टुरव्यतिरेकः, सर्वविकारसृष्टिश्च न परस्मादात्मनोऽन्यत्रोपपद्यते ॥ १६ ॥`

##### Transliteration
**Sutra:**
`Netaro’nupapatteḥ || 16 ||`

`Itaścānandamayaḥ para evātmā, netaraḥ; itara īśvarādanyaḥ saṃsārī jīva ityarthaḥ. Na jīva ānandamayaśabdenābhidhīyate. Kasmāt? Anupapatteḥ. Ānandamayaṃ hi prakṛtya śrūyate—‘So’kāmayata. Bahu syāṃ prajāyeyeti. Sa tapo’tapyata. Sa tapastaptvā. Idaṅ sarvamasṛjata. Yadidaṃ kiñca’ (Tai. U. 2.6.1) iti.

#### II. **Translation**

##### Sutra
"It (Ānandamaya) is not the other (Jīva), because it would be illogical."

##### Bhāṣya
Further, **Ānandamaya is indeed the Supreme Self (Para Ātman)**, not the other (Jīva, the transmigrating individual self).
- **Jīva is not referred to by the term Ānandamaya.**

**Why?**
- Because such an interpretation would be **illogical (anupapatti)**.

The Upaniṣad clearly describes Ānandamaya as:
- **“He (Brahman) desired: May I become many; may I be born.”**
- **“He performed austerity, and having performed austerity, He created all this—whatever exists.”** (Tait. Up. 2.6.1).

Thus, the **meditation and creative activity** described here cannot pertain to the individual Jīva, but only to the Supreme Self (Brahman):
1. **Before the creation of the body (prāk śarīra),** meditation on creation is described.
2. The **non-difference between the Creator (sraṣṭṛ) and creation (vikāras)** is affirmed.
3. The creation of all modifications (vikāras) is possible only when attributed to the Supreme Self, not to any entity other than Brahman.

#### III. **Breaking Down Key Moments**

##### 1. **Rejection of Jīva as Ānandamaya**
   - The transmigrating Jīva, bound by karma and ignorance, cannot be equated with Ānandamaya.
   - **Reason:** The creative and causal attributes described in the Upaniṣad (e.g., meditation, creation) do not logically apply to the Jīva.

##### 2. **Scriptural Evidence Supporting Brahman**
   - **“So’kāmayata”:** Brahman’s desire to create reflects its self-determination, an attribute of the Supreme, not the limited Jīva.
   - **Creation Sequence:** Brahman’s meditation (tapas) and creation of the universe align with its status as the universal cause.

##### 3. **Non-Difference Between Creator and Creation**
   - **Non-duality (Advaita):** The Upaniṣad establishes the unity of the Creator and creation.
   - Modifications (vikāras) like space, beings, and bodies arise **within Brahman**, emphasizing its immanence.

##### 4. **Illogical Attribution to Jīva**
   - Jīva, as an individual entity conditioned by body and mind, lacks the capacity to initiate or sustain creation.
   - Creation’s scope and universality make Brahman the only logical candidate for Ānandamaya.

---

#### IV. **Philosophical Analysis**

##### A. **Brahman as Ānandamaya**
   - The attributes of **desire, meditation, and creation** firmly place Ānandamaya as Brahman.
   - This aligns with Vedānta’s assertion of Brahman as **both the material and efficient cause** of the universe.

##### B. **Non-Duality and Immanence**
   - The Upaniṣad’s teaching highlights Brahman’s **immanence in creation**, reinforcing its unity with all modifications (vikāras).
   - Jīva, being a derivative and limited manifestation, cannot assume the role of Creator.

##### C. **Pedagogical Clarity**
   - Vedānta’s progression eliminates misinterpretation by clearly distinguishing the attributes of the Jīva from those of Brahman.

---

#### V. **Comparative Insights**

##### 1. **Fichte and the Creative Self**
   - Fichte’s **Absolute I** parallels Brahman as the source of creation, engaging in self-determination to manifest the world.

##### 2. **Hegel and the Unity of Creator and Created**
   - Hegel’s dialectic resolves the distinction between the Creator and creation, aligning with Vedānta’s assertion of **non-difference (Advaita)** between Brahman and the universe.

---

#### VI. **Conclusion of Sutra I.16**

1. **Illogical Attribution to Jīva:**
   - The description of Ānandamaya as the Creator eliminates the possibility of its identification with the limited Jīva.

2. **Brahman as Supreme Creator:**
   - The creative attributes and the unity between Creator and creation affirm Brahman’s identity as Ānandamaya.

3. **Vedānta’s Consistency:**
   - This sutra reinforces Vedānta’s systematic progression toward recognizing Brahman as the ultimate, self-luminous, and blissful reality.
