#### II. **Translation**

##### Sutra
"And in this, it (scripture) teaches his union with that."

##### Bhāṣya
Further, the term **Ānandamaya** cannot refer to either **Pradhāna (the insentient primordial matter)** or **Jīva (the individual transmigrating self).**

Why?
- Because the **Upaniṣad** teaches the union (yoga) of the awakened individual (pratibuddha Jīva) with the **Ānandamaya**, which is none other than the Supreme Self (Paramātman).

This union, described as **tadātmanā yoga (identity with that), tadbhāvāpatti (becoming that), or mukti (liberation)**, is affirmed by scripture:
- **“When one finds security in this invisible, bodiless, indefinable, and foundationless reality, then one attains freedom from fear. But when one sees even the slightest separation in this, fear arises.”** (Tait. Up. 2.7.1).

The teaching is as follows:
1. **When one perceives even a small separation** between oneself and the Ānandamaya (Supreme Self), one remains bound by the fear of transmigration (saṃsāra-bhaya).
2. **When one abides in uninterrupted identity** with the Ānandamaya, one is freed from this fear.

This realization is possible only through the acceptance of the **Supreme Self (Paramātman)** as Ānandamaya.
- It cannot occur through Pradhāna (insentient matter) or Jīva (limited individual self).

**Conclusion:**
- Thus, Ānandamaya is firmly established as the Supreme Self (Paramātman).

#### III. **Breaking Down Key Moments**

##### 1. **Union with Ānandamaya**
   - The Upaniṣad teaches that liberation arises from recognizing one’s **identity (tadātmanā yoga)** with the Ānandamaya, not from identifying with Pradhāna or Jīva.
   - Liberation is the result of realizing **non-duality (Advaita)** with the Supreme Self.

##### 2. **Fear from Perceived Separation**
   - **Separation (antara):** The perception of duality between oneself and Ānandamaya leads to fear and continued transmigration.
   - **Non-separation (tādātmya):** Abiding in oneness with the Ānandamaya removes fear and results in liberation.

##### 3. **Paramātman as Ānandamaya**
   - Liberation is possible only through union with the **Supreme Self (Paramātman)**, which is described as **invisible, bodiless, and foundationless**.
   - Neither Pradhāna (insentient) nor Jīva (limited and bound) can fulfill this role.

---

#### IV. **Philosophical Analysis**

##### A. **Supreme Self as the Foundation of Liberation**
   - The Upaniṣadic teaching emphasizes that liberation arises from realizing the Supreme Self (Paramātman) as **non-different from oneself.**

##### B. **Fear as a Marker of Duality**
   - Fear (bhaya) is a result of perceiving duality.
   - True fearlessness (abhaya) is attained only when one recognizes one’s identity with the Supreme Self, the Ānandamaya.

##### C. **Distinction from Pradhāna and Jīva**
   - **Pradhāna (Sāṅkhya):** As insentient, it lacks the capacity to facilitate liberation.
   - **Jīva (Individual Self):** Limited by ignorance and individuality, it cannot represent the ultimate state of Ānandamaya.

---

#### V. **Comparative Insights**

##### 1. **Hegel’s Absolute Spirit**
   - The union of the individual with the Ānandamaya mirrors Hegel’s progression toward Absolute Spirit, where individuality is subsumed into universal self-consciousness.

##### 2. **Kant’s Noumenon**
   - The Supreme Self as **invisible, bodiless, and indefinable** aligns with Kant’s concept of the **noumenon**, the ultimate reality beyond empirical perception.

---

#### VI. **Conclusion of Sutra I.19**

1. **Union as Liberation:**
   - The Upaniṣadic teaching affirms liberation through oneness with the Ānandamaya, the Supreme Self.

2. **Fearlessness as Non-Duality:**
   - Perception of duality leads to fear, while non-duality ensures freedom and liberation.

3. **Ānandamaya is Paramātman:**
   - The term **Ānandamaya** refers exclusively to the Supreme Self, not to Pradhāna or Jīva.
