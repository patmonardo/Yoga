#### II. **Translation**

##### Sutra
"And because of desire, there is no need for inference."

##### Bhāṣya
In the context of **Ānandamaya**, the Upaniṣad declares:
- **“He (Brahman) desired: May I become many; may I be born.”** (Tait. Up. 2.6.1).

This **indication of desire (kāma)** excludes the possibility of the inert **Pradhāna** (the insentient principle postulated by Sāṅkhya) being either **Ānandamaya** or its cause.
- Even though the inert Pradhāna was previously refuted in Sutra I.1.5 (**“Īkṣaternāśabdam” – because of seeing, it cannot be the unmanifested word**), it is reexamined here due to its contextual relevance.

The repetition serves to **clarify and elaborate the general flow of arguments (gatisāmānya)** by emphasizing that Pradhāna lacks the **capacity for intentionality or creative desire**.

---

#### III. **Breaking Down Key Moments**

##### 1. **Assertion of Desire (Kāma) in Brahman**
   - The Upaniṣad describes Brahman as **desiring** creation, indicating **conscious intentionality**.
   - This characteristic of **agency (kāmayitṛtva)** inherently excludes the **insentient Pradhāna**, which lacks consciousness and the capacity to desire or act.

##### 2. **Refutation of Pradhāna as Cause**
   - Sāṅkhya posits Pradhāna (the inert primordial matter) as the root cause of the universe.
   - This is dismissed because:
     - Pradhāna is insentient and incapable of agency.
     - Creative desire implies a sentient, conscious being, which aligns with Brahman, not Pradhāna.

##### 3. **Reiteration of Previous Refutation (I.1.5)**
   - Pradhāna was previously rejected on the basis that the Upaniṣads describe **Brahman as seeing or contemplating (īkṣate)**, an act requiring consciousness.
   - Here, the additional element of **desire** reinforces that the cause of the universe must be sentient.

##### 4. **Contextual Relevance**
   - Although Pradhāna has already been refuted, its dismissal is repeated here to align with the **logical flow (gatisāmānya)** of arguments in the context of **Ānandamaya**.

---

#### IV. **Philosophical Implications**

##### A. **Brahman as Conscious Cause**
   - The sutra emphasizes Brahman’s **conscious nature**, contrasting it with the **inert Pradhāna** of Sāṅkhya.
   - Desire (kāma) underscores the intentionality and purposiveness of creation, a hallmark of Brahman’s agency.

##### B. **Incompatibility of Pradhāna**
   - Pradhāna’s insentience makes it an unsuitable candidate for being either **Ānandamaya** or the cause of the universe.
   - The refutation strengthens Vedānta’s commitment to **non-dual consciousness (Advaita)** as the ultimate reality.

##### C. **Repetition as Pedagogy**
   - The repeated refutation of Pradhāna demonstrates Vedānta’s methodological rigor, ensuring clarity in distinguishing Brahman from competing metaphysical models.

---

#### V. **Comparative Insights**

##### 1. **Hegel’s Creative Spirit**
   - Hegel’s **Absolute Spirit** mirrors Brahman’s creative intentionality, progressing from abstract self-awareness to concrete manifestation in the world.
   - The insentient Pradhāna corresponds to an abstract, inert substance that lacks the dynamic agency required for true creation.

##### 2. **Kant’s Teleology**
   - Kant’s emphasis on purposiveness in nature resonates with Brahman’s **desire-driven creation**, rejecting inert causality as sufficient to explain the universe.

---

#### VI. **Conclusion of Sutra I.18**

1. **Desire as Defining Agency:**
   - The Upaniṣadic declaration of Brahman’s **desire (kāma)** affirms its conscious nature and excludes Pradhāna as either **Ānandamaya** or its cause.

2. **Conscious Cause vs. Inert Matter:**
   - Brahman’s agency as the sentient cause is juxtaposed with the insentience of Pradhāna, reinforcing the non-dual framework of Vedānta.

3. **Methodological Rigor:**
   - The repetition of Pradhāna’s refutation demonstrates Vedānta’s commitment to a comprehensive and logical presentation of Brahman’s nature.
