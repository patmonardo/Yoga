`इतश्च प्राचुर्यार्थे मयट्; यस्मादानन्दहेतुत्वं ब्रह्मणो व्यपदिशति श्रुतिः — ‘एष ह्येवानन्दयाति’ इति — आनन्दयतीत्यर्थः । यो ह्यन्यानानन्दयति स प्रचुरानन्द इति प्रसिद्धं भवति; यथा लोके योऽन्येषां धनिकत्वमापादयति स प्रचुरधन इति गम्यते, तद्वत् । तस्मात्प्राचुर्यार्थेऽपि मयटः सम्भवादानन्दमयः पर एवात्मा ॥ १४ ॥`

#### II. **Translation**

##### Sutra
"And because of the scriptural declaration that it (Brahman) is the cause of bliss."

##### Bhāṣya
Further, the suffix **‘mayaṭ’** (in Ānandamaya) signifies **abundance (prācura)** because **Brahman is declared as the cause of bliss (ānanda)** in the scriptures:
- **“Eṣa hyevānandayāti” (Tait. Up. 2.7.1):** "It is this that causes bliss."

This means Brahman bestows bliss on others.
- In the world, a person who causes wealth in others is recognized as **abundant in wealth (pracura-dhana)**. Similarly, Brahman, as the cause of others' bliss, is **abundant in bliss (pracura-ānanda)**.

Thus, the possibility of **‘mayaṭ’** signifying abundance supports the interpretation of **Ānandamaya as Brahman**, the Supreme Self (Para Ātman).

#### III. **Key Points in the Bhāṣya**

##### 1. **Abundance vs. Modification**
   - The **mayaṭ suffix** in **Ānandamaya** does not imply modification (vikāra) but abundance (prācura), as established in Sutra I.13.
   - The scriptural context reinforces that **Ānandamaya signifies Brahman’s infinite bliss**, not a derived or limited bliss.

##### 2. **Scriptural Authority**
   - **Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.7.1:** "It is this (Brahman) that causes bliss (ānandayati)."
     - Brahman is recognized as the **source and cause of all bliss**, affirming its supreme, abundant nature.

##### 3. **Practical Analogy**
   - Just as a wealthy person (pracura-dhana) bestows wealth on others, Brahman (pracura-ānanda) causes bliss in all beings.
   - This analogy emphasizes Brahman’s nature as **self-complete** (pūrṇa) and **infinite in bliss**.

##### 4. **Conclusion**
   - The suffix **‘mayaṭ’** in **Ānandamaya** is appropriately interpreted as **abundance**.
   - Therefore, **Ānandamaya is Brahman**, the Supreme Self, not a secondary or conditioned entity.

#### IV. **Philosophical Implications**

##### A. **Nature of Brahman as Bliss (Ānanda)**
   - Brahman is the **ultimate source and cause** of all joy.
   - This role as the originator of bliss reflects Brahman’s **self-sufficient and infinite nature**.

##### B. **Teaching through Analogy**
   - Vedānta often employs worldly analogies (e.g., wealth bestowing wealth) to illustrate Brahman’s transcendental qualities.
   - Such methods guide aspirants from the known (empirical experiences) to the unknown (absolute reality).

##### C. **Abundance (Prācura) as Vedānta’s Hermeneutic**
   - The abundance interpretation resolves doubts regarding Brahman’s association with bliss, affirming that **Ānandamaya reflects the infinite fullness of Brahman**.

---

#### V. **Comparative Insights**

##### 1. **Fichte and Hegel: The Source of Bliss**
   - **Fichte:** Bliss arises from the **realization of unity** between the individual self and the infinite.
   - **Hegel:** The progression to Absolute Spirit culminates in self-awareness of the infinite, paralleling Brahman as the source of bliss.

##### 2. **Brahman as Absolute Cause**
   - Brahman’s role as the **source of bliss** aligns with the **Hegelian Absolute**, where the finite derives its reality from the infinite.

---

#### VI. **Conclusion of Sutra I.14**

1. **Resolution of Doubts:**
   - The suffix "mayaṭ" affirms **abundance**, not modification.
   - Brahman’s identity as the **cause of bliss** supports Ānandamaya as the Supreme Self.

2. **Philosophical Synthesis:**
   - Brahman is **self-complete (pūrṇa)** and the **infinite source** of all joy, integrating abundance with transcendence.

3. **Pedagogical Clarity:**
   - Vedānta’s use of worldly analogies provides a clear pathway for aspirants to grasp Brahman’s infinite, blissful nature.
