#### B. Technical Standards
1. Sanskrit terms format:
   ```markdown
   Sanskrit_term (transliteration): English
     - Further explanation on new line if needed
   ```

2. Systematic progression:
   - From text to analysis
   - From technical to philosophical
   - From particular to universal

#### C. Progressive Development
1. Update artifacts systematically:
   - As understanding deepens
   - As connections emerge
