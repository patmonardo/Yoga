#### **Translation**

**“Because of the scriptural teaching of distinction, the inner Being is different from the individual self (jīva).”**

- **Support from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (3.7.9):**
   - **“He who dwells in the sun, but is distinct from the sun; whom the sun does not know; whose body is the sun; who controls the sun from within—He is the inner Self, the immortal ruler.”**
- This passage demonstrates that the **Supreme Lord (Paramātman)** is distinct from both:
   - The physical entity (āditya).
   - The individual consciousness (vijñāna-ātmā, associated with the sun).

Thus, the **inner Being (antar-yāmī)**, described as dwelling within the sun (āditya), must be the **Supreme Lord**, not the individual self (jīva). The same logic applies to the Person described as “inside the eye” in earlier sections.

### **Śaṅkara’s Explanation**

1. **Teaching of Distinction (Bhinnatva Vyapadeśa)**
   - The Upaniṣadic passage explicitly states that the **inner ruler (antar-yāmī)** is distinct from:
     - The sun itself (āditya).
     - The jīva, or the individual self associated with the sun.
   - The sun (āditya) and the jīva do not know the inner ruler, who controls them from within.

2. **Support for the Supreme Lord (Paramātman)**
   - Since the inner ruler (antar-yāmī) is beyond the sun and the jīva, and exercises supreme control over them, it must be the **Supreme Lord**.
   - The description of the inner Being aligns with the **omniscience, omnipotence, and immortality** of the Supreme Lord.

3. **Shruti Parallels**
   - The description in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad matches the descriptions in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, indicating the same Supreme Lord is referred to in both cases.

4. **Reaffirmation of the Teaching**
   - The Being described as dwelling "inside the sun" and "inside the eye" in earlier sections is none other than the **Paramātman**, as supported by the **consistency of scriptural statements (śruti-sāmānya)**.

### **Conclusion of Sutra 21**

- **Establishment of the Supreme Lord:**
   The inner Being described in relation to both the cosmic (sun) and individual (eye) realms is definitively identified as the **Supreme Lord (Paramātman)**.

- **Key Distinction:**
   The Paramātman is distinct from both the physical elements (āditya, the sun) and the individual selves (jīvas) associated with them.

- **Philosophical Implication:**
   The teaching reinforces the Advaitic understanding of Brahman as the ultimate substratum and controller of all existence, transcending both the macrocosmic and microcosmic realms.
