### **Introduction: Scriptural Reference to Ākāśa**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
इदमामनन्ति ‘अस्य लोकस्य का गतिरित्याकाश इति होवाच सर्वाणि ह वा इमानि भूतान्याकाशादेव समुत्पद्यन्त आकाशं प्रत्यस्तं यन्त्याकाशो ह्येवैभ्यो ज्यायानाकाशः परायणम्’ (छा. उ. १ । ९ । १) इति ।

#### **Transliteration**:
Idam āmananti ‘Asya lokasya kā gatir ity ākāśa iti hovāca sarvāṇi ha vā imāni bhūtāny ākāśād eva samutpadyanta ākāśaṃ pratyastaṃ yanty ākāśo hyevaibhyo jyāyān ākāśaḥ parāyaṇam’ (Chā. U. 1.9.1) iti.

#### **Translation**:
This is stated in the scriptures:
“What is the ultimate refuge of this world?” He replied, “It is Ākāśa. All these beings are born from Ākāśa alone, they dissolve into Ākāśa, and Ākāśa is indeed greater and the ultimate refuge.” (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.9.1)

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Core Teaching**:
   - The Chāndogya Upaniṣad refers to "Ākāśa" as the **source**, **sustainer**, and **final refuge** of all beings. This verse establishes Ākāśa as the causal principle behind all existence.

2. **Key Words**:
   - **Ākāśa**: Translated as "space" or "ether," but its meaning varies based on context. In Vedānta, it can signify either **elemental space (bhūtākāśa)** or **Brahman**, depending on the associated indicators.
   - **Jyāyān**: "Greater." Indicates the ultimate superiority of Ākāśa over all other entities.
   - **Parāyaṇam**: "Final refuge." Suggests that Ākāśa is the ultimate destination of all beings, pointing to its causal and sustaining nature.

3. **Relevance of the Quotation**:
   - This Upaniṣadic passage forms the foundation of the discussion in this sutra. The term "Ākāśa" is being analyzed to determine whether it refers to **Brahman** or the **elemental space**.

4. **Framing the Debate**:
   - The Upaniṣadic text provides **indicative marks (liṅga)** suggesting that Ākāśa may be Brahman, as it serves as the origin and dissolution point for all beings.
   - However, the word "Ākāśa" is also commonly used to denote the physical element of space, leading to ambiguity.

5. **Context in Vedānta**:
   - Vedānta prioritizes identifying the ultimate cause, which is always **Brahman**. If Ākāśa here is interpreted as elemental space, it would contradict Vedāntic principles that attribute the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of all beings to Brahman.

---

### **Key Takeaways for Further Analysis**:
1. The quotation provides a clear starting point for the debate: Is **Ākāśa** Brahman or something else?
2. Indicators like "greater" and "final refuge" (jyāyān and parāyaṇam) favor an interpretation of Ākāśa as Brahman.
3. Further arguments will explore why Ākāśa cannot be reduced to elemental space and must instead signify the supreme reality.

### **The Doubt (Saṃśaya)**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
तत्र संशयः — किमाकाशशब्देन परं ब्रह्माभिधीयते, उत भूताकाशमिति ।

#### **Transliteration**:
Tatra saṃśayaḥ — kim ākāśaśabdena paraṃ brahmābhidhīyate, uta bhūtākāśam iti.

#### **Translation**:
Here arises the doubt: Does the term "Ākāśa" refer to the **Supreme Brahman** or to **elemental space (bhūtākāśa)**?

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Core Doubt**:
   - The term **Ākāśa** is used in the Upaniṣadic passage referenced in the Introduction. However, the context does not explicitly clarify whether this Ākāśa is **Brahman**, the ultimate reality, or **elemental space**, the physical medium that pervades the universe.

2. **Sources of Ambiguity**:
   - **Dual Usage**:
     - The term "Ākāśa" is commonly used in two ways:
       - As **elemental space** (bhūtākāśa) in worldly and scriptural contexts.
       - As **Brahman**, especially in philosophical contexts where Ākāśa is described with extraordinary attributes.
     - Example: In Taittirīya Upaniṣad (2.7.1), Ākāśa is referred to as a locus of bliss, hinting at Brahman.
   - **Indicative Marks**:
     - The indicators (liṅga) in the text—such as Ākāśa being "greater" and the "final refuge"—could apply to either Brahman or bhūtākāśa depending on interpretation.

3. **Significance of the Doubt**:
   - **Vedāntic Priority**: Identifying the correct referent of Ākāśa is crucial because the text is discussing the ultimate cause of all beings. In Vedānta, this role belongs solely to Brahman.
   - **Philosophical Implications**: If Ākāśa is interpreted as **bhūtākāśa**, the passage might be considered to describe a subordinate cause in a cosmological chain. If interpreted as **Brahman**, it aligns with the non-dual principle of Vedānta.

4. **Contextual Factors**:
   - The Upaniṣadic context (Chāndogya 1.9.1) describes Ākāśa as the origin, dissolution, and ultimate refuge. These attributes are commonly associated with **Brahman**, but the word "Ākāśa" often denotes physical space in everyday usage.

---

### **Key Takeaways for Further Analysis**:
1. The doubt establishes the need for a systematic examination of the context and indicative marks in the scripture to resolve the ambiguity.
2. The next sections will analyze the **basis of doubt** and provide arguments for and against both interpretations.

Would you like to proceed to the next section (**Basis of Doubt: Usage in Different Contexts**) for further analysis?

### **Basis of Doubt: Usage in Different Contexts**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
कुतः संशयः ? उभयत्र प्रयोगदर्शनात् । भूतविशेषे तावत्सुप्रसिद्धो लोकवेदयोराकाशशब्दः । ब्रह्मण्यपि क्वचित्प्रयुज्यमानो दृश्यते, यत्र वाक्यशेषवशादसाधारणगुणश्रवणाद्वा निर्धारितं ब्रह्म भवति — यथा ‘यदेष आकाश आनन्दो न स्यात्’ (तै. उ. २ । ७ । १) इति, ‘आकाशो वै नाम नामरूपयोर्निर्वहिता ते यदन्तरा तद्ब्रह्म’ (छा. उ. ८ । १४ । १) इति चैवमादौ । अतः संशयः ।

#### **Transliteration**:
Kutaḥ saṃśayaḥ? Ubhayatra prayoga darśanāt. Bhūtaviśeṣe tāvat suprasiddho loka vedayoḥ ākāśaśabdaḥ. Brahmaṇy api kvacit prayujyamāno dṛśyate, yatra vākyaśeṣavaśād asādhāraṇaguṇaśravaṇād vā nirdhāritaṃ brahma bhavati — yathā ‘Yadeṣa ākāśa ānando na syāt’ (Tai. U. 2.7.1) iti, ‘Ākāśo vai nāma nāmarūpayor nirvahitā te yad antarā tad brahma’ (Chā. U. 8.14.1) iti ca evamādau. Ataḥ saṃśayaḥ.

#### **Translation**:
Why does the doubt arise?
Because the word "Ākāśa" is used in both contexts:
1. **As elemental space (bhūtākāśa)**: This is the well-known meaning in both worldly and Vedic usage.
2. **As Brahman**: In some contexts, the term refers to Brahman, as seen in passages like:
   - *"If this Ākāśa were not blissful…"* (Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.7.1).
   - *"Ākāśa is the support of name and form; that which lies beyond is Brahman"* (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.14.1).

Hence, there is doubt.

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Dual Usage of "Ākāśa"**:
   - **Common Usage**:
     - In both ordinary life and Vedic rituals, "Ākāśa" usually refers to the **elemental space** (bhūtākāśa).
     - This is the pervasive physical medium that allows for sound and motion, making it a familiar concept.
   - **Philosophical Usage**:
     - In certain Upaniṣadic contexts, "Ākāśa" transcends its ordinary meaning and refers to **Brahman**, characterized by unique attributes (asādhāraṇa-guṇa).
     - Examples:
       - **Taittirīya Upaniṣad (2.7.1)**: Suggests that Ākāśa is the locus of bliss (ānanda), which aligns with Brahman.
       - **Chāndogya Upaniṣad (8.14.1)**: Describes Ākāśa as the substratum of name and form, pointing to a reality beyond the physical.

---

2. **Indicative Marks (Liṅga)**:
   - The doubt stems from observing **liṅgas**—contextual hints or attributes that suggest whether a term refers to Brahman or something else.
   - For example:
     - If "Ākāśa" is described as the origin and dissolution of all beings, it aligns with Brahman.
     - If it merely refers to the medium of physical existence, it aligns with bhūtākāśa.

---

3. **Upaniṣadic Examples Supporting Brahman**:
   - In certain passages, **Ākāśa** is explicitly identified with Brahman:
     - *"Ākāśa is the support of name and form; what lies beyond is Brahman"* (Chāndogya 8.14.1).
     - *"If this Ākāśa were not blissful…"* (Taittirīya 2.7.1) ties bliss (ānanda) to Ākāśa, a hallmark of Brahman.

---

4. **Root of the Doubt**:
   - **Familiarity vs. Philosophy**:
     - Bhūtākāśa is the more familiar, readily understood meaning of "Ākāśa."
     - However, the presence of extraordinary attributes (e.g., bliss, substratum of all existence) in the context suggests Brahman.
   - **Dual Contexts Create Ambiguity**:
     - Both meanings are supported by scriptural usage, making the interpretation dependent on context and indicative marks.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. The dual usage of "Ākāśa" creates ambiguity, necessitating a careful examination of the context.
2. Passages with extraordinary attributes favor interpreting Ākāśa as Brahman.
3. The next sections will evaluate arguments for and against interpreting Ākāśa as **bhūtākāśa** or **Brahman**.

### **Initial Argument for Bhūtākāśa**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
किं पुनरत्र युक्तम् ? भूताकाशमिति । कुतः ? तद्धि प्रसिद्धतरेण प्रयोगेण शीघ्रं बुद्धिमारोहति । न चायमाकाशशब्द उभयोः साधारणः शक्यो विज्ञातुम्, अनेकार्थत्वप्रसङ्गात् । तस्माद्ब्रह्मणि गौण आकाशशब्दो भवितुमर्हति । विभुत्वादिभिर्हि बहुभिर्धर्मैः सदृशमाकाशेन ब्रह्म भवति । न च मुख्यसम्भवे गौणोऽर्थो ग्रहणमर्हति । सम्भवति चेह मुख्यस्यैवाकाशस्य ग्रहणम् ।

#### **Transliteration**:
Kiṃ punar atra yuktam? Bhūtākāśam iti. Kutaḥ? Taddhi prasiddhatareṇa prayogeṇa śīghraṃ buddhim ārohati. Na cāyam ākāśaśabda ubhayoḥ sādhāraṇaḥ śakyo vijñātum, anekārthatva-prasaṅgāt. Tasmād brahmaṇi gauṇa ākāśaśabdo bhavitum arhati. Vibhutvādibhir hi bahubhir dharmaiḥ sadṛśam ākāśena brahma bhavati. Na ca mukhya-sambhave gauṇo'rtho grahaṇam arhati. Sambhavati ceha mukhyasyaivākāśasya grahaṇam.

#### **Translation**:
What is reasonable here? That the term "Ākāśa" refers to **elemental space (bhūtākāśa)**. Why?
1. Because it is the more familiar usage and is quickly understood by the mind.
2. The word "Ākāśa" cannot be commonly applied to both Brahman and space without causing confusion due to multiple meanings.
3. Therefore, the term is more appropriately interpreted as referring to **space** (bhūtākāśa).
4. Brahman may be described metaphorically (gauṇa) as resembling space due to shared attributes like pervasiveness (vibhutva).
5. However, when a primary meaning (mukhya artha) is possible, a secondary metaphorical meaning (gauṇa artha) should not be accepted.
6. In this context, the primary meaning of "Ākāśa" as elemental space is applicable.

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Familiarity and Common Usage**:
   - The term "Ākāśa" is widely recognized and understood in its ordinary sense as elemental space.
   - This familiarity leads to an intuitive understanding that does not require deeper philosophical reasoning.

2. **Avoiding Ambiguity**:
   - If "Ākāśa" were interpreted to mean both **elemental space** and **Brahman**, it would lead to confusion (anekārthatva).
   - To maintain clarity, the word should retain its more direct, commonly understood meaning—bhūtākāśa.

3. **Brahman as Metaphor (Gauṇa)**:
   - Brahman could be metaphorically referred to as "Ākāśa" because it shares certain attributes with space:
     - **Vibhutva**: All-pervasiveness.
     - **Subtlety**: Like space, Brahman is not tangible or confined.
   - However, the Bhāṣya argues that a metaphorical interpretation is only valid when the primary meaning is impossible. Here, "Ākāśa" as elemental space is viable.

4. **Primary vs. Metaphorical Meaning**:
   - The principle of **mukhya artha vs. gauṇa artha** dictates that the primary meaning should always be preferred if it fits the context.
   - Since "Ākāśa" as elemental space makes sense in this passage, there is no need to adopt the metaphorical interpretation of Brahman.

5. **Argument's Strength**:
   - This initial reasoning strongly favors interpreting "Ākāśa" as **bhūtākāśa**, given its widespread familiarity and the absence of any immediate contradiction.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. The argument rests on **familiarity**, **clarity**, and **contextual fit** to establish "Ākāśa" as elemental space.
2. Brahman is presented as a secondary, metaphorical interpretation, which is dismissed in favor of the primary meaning.
3. The next section will counter this argument by examining **contextual indicators** that support interpreting Ākāśa as Brahman.

### **Refutation of Bhūtākāśa Based on Context**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
ननु भूताकाशपरिग्रहे वाक्यशेषो नोपपद्यते — ‘सर्वाणि ह वा इमानि भूतान्याकाशादेव समुत्पद्यन्ते’ इत्यादिः नैष दोषः, भूताकाशस्यापि वाय्वादिक्रमेण कारणत्वोपपत्तेः । विज्ञायते हि — ‘तस्माद्वा एतस्मादात्मन आकाशः सम्भूत आकाशाद्वायुर्वायोरग्निः’ (तै. उ. २ । १ । १) इत्यादि । ज्यायस्त्वपरायणत्वे अपि भूतान्तरापेक्षयोपपद्येते भूताकाशस्यापि । तस्मादाकाशशब्देन भूताकाशस्य ग्रहणमित्येवं प्राप्ते ब्रूमः — ‘आकाशस्तल्लिङ्गात्’ ।

#### **Transliteration**:
Nanu bhūtākāśa parigrahe vākyaseṣo nopapadyate — ‘Sarvāṇi ha vā imāni bhūtāny ākāśād eva samutpadyante’ ityādiḥ naiṣa doṣaḥ, bhūtākāśasya api vāyvādikrameṇa kāraṇatvopapatteḥ. Vijñāyate hi — ‘Tasmād vā etasmād ātmana ākāśaḥ sambhūta ākāśād vāyur vāyor agniḥ’ (Tai. U. 2.1.1) ityādi. Jyāyastvapārāyaṇatve api bhūtāntarāpekṣayā upapadyete bhūtākāśasya api. Tasmād ākāśaśabdena bhūtākāśasya grahaṇam ity evaṃ prāpte brūmaḥ — ‘Ākāśas talliṅgāt.’

#### **Translation**:
If "Ākāśa" is interpreted as **elemental space (bhūtākāśa)**, the context (vākyaseṣa) does not align. For example:
*"All these beings are born from Ākāśa"* (Chāndogya 1.9.1).
However, this issue is dismissed by proponents of bhūtākāśa, who argue that elemental space can also be a cause, as illustrated by:
*"From this Self arose Ākāśa, from Ākāśa air, from air fire..."* (Taittirīya 2.1.1).
Even the descriptions of Ākāśa as "greater" (jyāyān) and "the ultimate refuge" (parāyaṇam) could apply to bhūtākāśa when compared to other elements like air or fire.

Thus, the interpretation of Ākāśa as **elemental space** seems reasonable.
However, we say:
*"Ākāśa refers to Brahman because of the indicative marks (liṅga)."*

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Contextual Misalignment**:
   - The **vākyaseṣa** (remainder of the passage) creates tension if Ākāśa is interpreted as elemental space:
     - The claim that "all beings originate from Ākāśa" aligns more naturally with Brahman as the ultimate cause, rather than elemental space.
     - Elemental space (bhūtākāśa) is a derivative cause in Vedānta’s cosmology, not the ultimate one.

2. **Rebuttal from Bhūtākāśa Proponents**:
   - Proponents of the elemental space interpretation argue that bhūtākāśa can be a valid causal entity:
     - Taittirīya Upaniṣad (2.1.1) explicitly describes the sequence: Brahman → Ākāśa → Air → Fire. This suggests that elemental space can act as a medium in creation.
     - Comparisons of greatness (jyāyān) and finality (parāyaṇam) could still apply to bhūtākāśa relative to other elements, like air or fire.

3. **Counterargument for Brahman**:
   - Despite these points, the ultimate cause in Vedānta is always **Brahman**, not a derivative element like space.
   - Indicative marks (liṅga) such as "greater" and "final refuge" (jyāyān and parāyaṇam) point directly to Brahman, as these qualities are absolute and not comparative.

4. **Indicative Marks (Liṅga)**:
   - The Bhāṣya emphasizes that the attributes described in the passage:
     - The **origin of all beings**.
     - The **dissolution of all beings**.
     - The **ultimate refuge**.
     - These are traditionally and contextually associated with **Brahman**, not elemental space.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. The interpretation of Ākāśa as bhūtākāśa is refuted by pointing to the contextual indicators (liṅga) that align more naturally with Brahman.
2. The qualities of origin, greatness, and finality are better suited to Brahman than to elemental space.
3. This sets up the positive argument for interpreting Ākāśa as **Brahman**, which will be elaborated further in subsequent sections.

### **Support for Brahman as Ākāśa**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
‘आकाशं प्रत्यस्तं यन्ति’ इति ब्रह्मलिङ्गम्, ‘आकाशो ह्येवैभ्यो ज्यायानाकाशः परायणम्’ इति च ज्यायस्त्वपरायणत्वे । ज्यायस्त्वं ह्यनापेक्षिकं परमात्मन्येवैकस्मिन्नाम्नातम् — ‘ज्यायान्पृथिव्या ज्यायानन्तरिक्षाज्ज्यायान्दिवो ज्यायानेभ्यो लोकेभ्यः’ (छा. उ. ३ । १४ । ३) इति । तथा परायणत्वमपि परमकारणत्वात्परमात्मन्येव उपपन्नतरम् । श्रुतिश्च — ‘विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्म रातिर्दातुः परायणम्’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ९ । २८) इति ।

#### **Transliteration**:
‘Ākāśaṃ pratyastaṃ yanti’ iti brahmaliṅgam, ‘Ākāśo hyevaibhyo jyāyān ākāśaḥ parāyaṇam’ iti ca jyāyastvaparāyaṇatve. Jyāyastvaṃ hy anāpekṣikaṃ paramātmany evaikasminn āmnātam — ‘Jyāyān pṛthivyā jyāyān antarīkṣāj jyāyān divo jyāyān ebhyo lokebhyaḥ’ (Chā. U. 3.14.3) iti. Tathā parāyaṇatvam api paramakāraṇatvāt paramātmany eva upapannataram. Śrutiś ca — ‘Vijñānam ānandaṃ brahma rātir dātuḥ parāyaṇam’ (Bṛ. U. 3.9.28) iti.

#### **Translation**:
The statement *“all beings dissolve into Ākāśa”* serves as an **indicative mark (liṅga)** of Brahman. Similarly, the phrases *“Ākāśa is greater”* and *“Ākāśa is the ultimate refuge”* support Brahman.
- **Greatness (jyāyastva)**: This quality is absolute and is only attributed to the Supreme Self (Paramātman) in scriptures such as:
  *“Greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven, and greater than all these worlds”* (Chā. U. 3.14.3).
- **Ultimate refuge (parāyaṇatva)**: As the ultimate cause of everything, only Brahman can be described as the supreme refuge. This is affirmed in:
  *“Brahman is knowledge and bliss, and the refuge of the giver”* (Bṛ. U. 3.9.28).

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Indicative Marks (Liṅga)**:
   - The Bhāṣya emphasizes the **liṅgas** in the scriptural context that point to **Brahman**:
     - **Dissolution into Ākāśa**: All beings return to Ākāśa, indicating that it is the ultimate substratum.
     - **Greatness (Jyāyastva)**: Absolute greatness is a hallmark of Brahman, not of any finite entity like elemental space.
     - **Ultimate refuge (Parāyaṇatva)**: Only Brahman, the supreme cause, can be the final refuge of all beings.

2. **Scriptural Evidence for Greatness**:
   - Chāndogya Upaniṣad (3.14.3): Describes Brahman as surpassing all elements and worlds, reinforcing its status as the ultimate entity.
   - Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (3.9.28): Identifies Brahman as both bliss and the ultimate refuge, aligning with the qualities attributed to Ākāśa in the context.

3. **Brahman vs. Bhūtākāśa**:
   - **Absolute vs. Relative Greatness**:
     - Elemental space (bhūtākāśa) might appear "greater" than certain other elements (e.g., air or fire), but this greatness is relative.
     - Brahman’s greatness, by contrast, is absolute and independent of any comparison or context (anāpekṣika).
   - **Role as Ultimate Refuge**:
     - Bhūtākāśa cannot serve as the final refuge because it is itself dependent on Brahman as its cause. Brahman, being the ultimate cause, is the true refuge.

4. **Infinitude (Anantya)**:
   - Brahman is infinite, encompassing all beings and transcending limitations. This aligns with descriptions of Ākāśa as infinite in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (1.9.2).

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. The **indicative marks** in the scripture—such as dissolution, greatness, and refuge—are better suited to **Brahman** than to elemental space (bhūtākāśa).
2. The absoluteness of Brahman’s attributes sets it apart from any finite or dependent entity like elemental space.
3. This section establishes a strong case for interpreting **Ākāśa** in this context as referring to **Brahman**.

Would you like to proceed to **Brahman as Infinite and its Refutation of Bhūtākāśa**?
### **Brahman as Infinite and Refutation of Bhūtākāśa**

---

#### **Sanskrit**:
अपि चान्तवत्त्वदोषेण शालावत्यस्य पक्षं निन्दित्वा, अनन्तं किञ्चिद्वक्तुकामेन जैवलिनाकाशः परिगृहीतः । तं चाकाशमुद्गीथे सम्पाद्योपसंहरति — ‘स एष परोवरीयानुद्गीथः स एषोऽनन्तः’ (छा. उ. १ । ९ । २) इति । तच्चानन्त्यं ब्रह्मलिङ्गम् ।

#### **Transliteration**:
Api ca antavattvadoṣeṇa śālāvatyasya pakṣaṃ ninditvā, anantaṃ kiñcid vaktukāmena jaivalinākāśaḥ parigṛhītaḥ. Taṃ cākāśam udgīthe sampādya upasaṃharati — ‘Sa eṣa parovarīyān udgīthaḥ sa eṣo’nantaḥ’ (Chā. U. 1.9.2) iti. Tac cānantyaṃ brahmaliṅgam.

#### **Translation**:
Furthermore, the flaw of finitude (antavattva) in the interpretation of space (bhūtākāśa) is criticized in the Śālāvatya doctrine. To emphasize infinitude (anantya), Jaivalin Ākāśa is adopted. This Ākāśa, presented as part of the Udgītha meditation, is ultimately concluded to be **infinite**:
*"This is the supreme and greatest Udgītha. This is infinite."* (Chā. U. 1.9.2).
This infinitude serves as an **indicative mark (liṅga)** of Brahman.

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Finitude (Antavattva) of Bhūtākāśa**:
   - The Bhāṣya critiques the view that Ākāśa refers to elemental space because:
     - Bhūtākāśa is **finite** (antavat).
     - As a dependent entity within creation, elemental space cannot possess the quality of **infinitude** required for Brahman.

2. **Infinitude (Anantya) as a Mark of Brahman**:
   - The scripture explicitly describes Ākāśa as **infinite** (ananta), which is a defining attribute of Brahman.
   - Infinitude implies independence, all-pervasiveness, and transcendence—all qualities uniquely associated with Brahman in Vedānta.

3. **Rejection of Śālāvatya’s Doctrine**:
   - The Śālāvatya view, which likely identifies Ākāśa with a finite entity, is rejected due to its inability to account for the infinite nature described in the text.
   - The Jaivalin interpretation, aligning Ākāśa with Brahman, emphasizes its infinite and supreme nature.

4. **Chāndogya Upaniṣad (1.9.2)**:
   - The Ākāśa mentioned in the context of the **Udgītha meditation** is described as:
     - **Supreme (parovarīyān)**: The highest among entities.
     - **Infinite (ananta)**: Beyond limitation, a quality unique to Brahman.
   - This passage strengthens the argument for Brahman as the intended meaning of Ākāśa.

5. **Brahman vs. Bhūtākāśa**:
   - **Bhūtākāśa**:
     - Limited in scope and role within creation.
     - Cannot serve as the infinite substratum or ultimate cause.
   - **Brahman**:
     - Infinite and all-encompassing.
     - Solely capable of being the ultimate reality described in the Upaniṣads.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. **Infinitude (anantya)** is a definitive attribute of Brahman and disqualifies Bhūtākāśa as the intended meaning of Ākāśa in this context.
2. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad explicitly describes Ākāśa as infinite, which cannot apply to elemental space.
3. This section firmly establishes **Brahman** as the true referent of Ākāśa by negating the possibility of Bhūtākāśa based on its finitude.

#### **Sanskrit**:
तस्मादाकाशशब्दं ब्रह्मेति सिद्धम् ॥ २२ ॥

#### **Transliteration**:
Tasmād ākāśaśabdaṃ brahma iti siddham. || 22 ||

#### **Translation**:
Thus, it is established that the term "Ākāśa" refers to **Brahman**.

---

### **Analysis**

1. **Resolution of Doubt**:
   - The debate regarding whether Ākāśa refers to **elemental space (bhūtākāśa)** or **Brahman** is conclusively resolved.
   - Indicative marks (liṅga) from the scriptural context favor the interpretation of Ākāśa as **Brahman**.

2. **Key Arguments Supporting Brahman**:
   - **Indicative Marks (Liṅga)**:
     - Brahman is described as the **origin, sustenance, and dissolution** of all beings in the scripture.
     - Attributes like **greatness (jyāyastva)** and **ultimate refuge (parāyaṇatva)** align exclusively with Brahman.
   - **Infinitude (Anantya)**:
     - The quality of being infinite, as explicitly stated in the context of Ākāśa, is a defining characteristic of Brahman, not of finite entities like elemental space.
   - **Contextual Alignment**:
     - The Upaniṣadic passage situates Ākāśa as the ultimate substratum, which aligns only with the role of Brahman in Vedānta.

3. **Rejection of Bhūtākāśa**:
   - **Finitude**: Bhūtākāśa is finite and cannot fulfill the scriptural description of being infinite and the ultimate cause.
   - **Dependent Nature**: As a derived element, bhūtākāśa cannot serve as the ultimate substratum or refuge.

4. **Alignment with Vedānta**:
   - Vedānta consistently identifies Brahman as the ultimate cause of creation, dissolution, and sustenance.
   - By interpreting Ākāśa as Brahman, this passage aligns seamlessly with the larger philosophical framework of Vedānta.

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. The term "Ākāśa" in the context of **Sutra I.22** refers to **Brahman**, the infinite and ultimate reality.
2. Indicative marks (liṅga), such as infinitude, greatness, and being the ultimate refuge, confirm Brahman as the referent.
3. This conclusion strengthens the Vedāntic teaching of Brahman as the sole cause and substratum of all existence.

### **Summary of Sutra I.22: Ākāśa as Brahman**

---

#### **Sutra**:
आकाशस्तल्लिङ्गात् ॥ २२ ॥
**Transliteration**:
Ākāśas talliṅgāt. || 22 ||
**Translation**:
The word "Ākāśa" refers to Brahman because of indicative marks (liṅga).

### **Key Points of the Discussion**

#### **1. The Doubt (Saṃśaya)**:
Does the term "Ākāśa" refer to **Brahman**, the Supreme Reality, or **elemental space (bhūtākāśa)**?
- This doubt arises because "Ākāśa" is used in both senses in scriptural and worldly contexts.

---

#### **2. Arguments for Bhūtākāśa**:
- **Familiarity**: "Ākāśa" is commonly understood as elemental space, making it the more natural interpretation.
- **Primary Meaning (Mukhya)**: The primary meaning of "Ākāśa" as space should be preferred unless context demands otherwise.
- **Metaphorical Use (Gauṇa)**: Brahman could be metaphorically likened to Ākāśa due to shared attributes like pervasiveness.

---

#### **3. Refutation of Bhūtākāśa**:
- **Indicative Marks (Liṅga)**:
  - Scriptural context describes Ākāśa as:
    - **The origin and dissolution of all beings**.
    - **Greater than all entities** (jyāyastva).
    - **The ultimate refuge** (parāyaṇatva).
  These attributes align with Brahman, not elemental space.
- **Finitude**: Bhūtākāśa is finite, while the Upaniṣads describe Ākāśa as infinite (ananta), a definitive quality of Brahman.
- **Dependent Nature**: Bhūtākāśa is a derivative element, dependent on Brahman as its cause, and cannot be the ultimate substratum.

---

#### **4. Support for Brahman**:
- **Greatness (Jyāyastva)**: Scriptures like Chāndogya Upaniṣad (3.14.3) describe Brahman as greater than all elements and worlds.
- **Ultimate Refuge (Parāyaṇatva)**: Brahman is the final refuge and substratum for all beings, as stated in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (3.9.28).
- **Infinitude (Anantya)**: The infinitude attributed to Ākāśa in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (1.9.2) is a hallmark of Brahman.

---

#### **5. Conclusion**:
- The term "Ākāśa" in this context refers to **Brahman**, as established by:
  - Indicative marks (liṅga) in the scripture.
  - Attributes like infinitude, greatness, and being the ultimate refuge.
- Elemental space (bhūtākāśa) is disqualified due to its finitude and dependent nature.

---

### **Philosophical Significance**:
1. **Consistency in Vedānta**:
   This interpretation aligns with the central Vedāntic teaching of Brahman as the sole cause and substratum of all existence.
2. **Role of Indicative Marks**:
   Indicative marks (liṅga) play a critical role in distinguishing between Brahman and derived entities like space.
3. **Reinforcement of Non-Duality**:
   By interpreting Ākāśa as Brahman, the scripture emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality, where Brahman alone is the ultimate principle.
