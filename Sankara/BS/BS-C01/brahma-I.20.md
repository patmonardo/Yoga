#### **Translation**

This is what is taught in the Upaniṣad:
1. **Within the Sun**:
   - **“There is a golden Person within the sun, seen as golden-bearded, golden-haired, golden from head to toe, even to the nails”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.6.6).
2. **Within the Eye**:
   - **“There is a Person within the eye, seen as having the same form as the one within the sun. The name of the one within the sun is ‘He who rises.’ This one rises above all sins for those who know him as such”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.6.7).

3. The text continues to describe the same entity in both **cosmic (āditya)** and **individual (akṣi)** contexts:
   - **“This is the same Person seen within the sun and within the eye”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.7.5).

---

### **Doubt Raised (Saṃśaya)**

The doubt arises:
- **What is the nature of this Person described as “inside”?**
   - **Option 1: A conditioned being (saṃsārī)**:
     - Is this a being who has attained greatness through karma and knowledge, residing within the sun (āditya) and the eye (akṣi) as an object of meditation (upāsya)?
   - **Option 2: The Supreme Lord (Paramātmā)**:
     - Or is this an eternally perfect entity, the all-pervading Supreme Lord, revealed in these forms for meditative purposes?

---

### **Analysis of the Doubt**

1. **Scriptural Context: The Upaniṣadic Descriptions**
   - The **golden Person within the sun and the eye** is described with attributes of form (golden beard, golden hair, etc.).
   - The **parallel descriptions** (āditya and akṣi) suggest a connection between the macrocosmic and microcosmic dimensions.

2. **Initial Confusion: Conditioned vs. Absolute**
   - The text describes attributes like form, location, and relational characteristics (e.g., removing sins), which can lead to two interpretations:
     - **Conditioned Being**: A being exalted through actions and worship, residing in these locations.
     - **Supreme Lord**: The unconditioned Paramātmā presented in forms for the purpose of meditation.

3. **Key Issues in the Doubt**
   - **Form (Rūpavattva)**: Can the Supreme Lord, described elsewhere as formless and beyond qualities, have a form like this?
   - **Dependence (Ādhāra)**: Does describing the Person as "inside" the sun or the eye imply dependence, which contradicts the independence of the Supreme Lord?
   - **Limited Power (Maryādā)**: Are the roles and powers described restricted to specific domains, which would conflict with the infinite dominion of the Supreme Lord?

---

### **Purpose of the Doubt**

Śaṅkara raises this doubt to prepare the ground for distinguishing between:
1. **Apparent descriptions** meant for meditation (upāsanā).
2. The **true nature of the Supreme Lord** as transcendent and beyond all limitations.

This sets the stage for the subsequent refutation of the **pūrvapakṣa** (preliminary conclusion) that the entity described is a conditioned being.

---

Would you like to proceed to **Section 2**, where the pūrvapakṣa argues that this Being is conditioned and saṃsārī based on form, dependence, and limited power?

#### **Translation**

Let us first consider the **prima facie conclusion (pūrvapakṣa)**:
- The Being described in the sun and the eye is a **conditioned being (saṃsārī)**, not the Supreme Lord (Paramātman).

**Why is this so?**

1. **Presence of Form (Rūpavattva)**
   - The **golden Person** is described with **attributes of form**:
     - **In the sun**: "Golden beard, golden hair, and entirely golden."
     - **In the eye**: The same form is transferred: "The form of the one in the sun is the form of the one in the eye."
   - This cannot refer to the formless Paramātman, as the **Kaṭha Upaniṣad** declares:
     - **“It is soundless, touchless, formless, and imperishable”** (Kaṭha Up. 1.3.15).

2. **Dependence on a Substratum (Ādhāra)**
   - The Being is described as **"inside the sun and the eye."**
   - A Supreme Lord who is self-established and all-pervading cannot have a substratum (ādhāra).
   - As the Chāndogya Upaniṣad declares:
     - **“Where is this Lord established? In His own majesty”** (Chāndogya Up. 7.24.1).
     - **“Like space, He is omnipresent and eternal”** (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.6.3.2).

3. **Limited Dominion (Maryāda)**
   - The Being’s dominion is described as **restricted to specific realms**:
     - **In the sun**: It governs the celestial realms and the desires of gods.
       - **“He governs the outer worlds and fulfills the desires of the gods”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.6.8).
     - **In the eye**: It governs the terrestrial realms and the desires of humans.
       - **“He governs the inner worlds and fulfills the desires of humans”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.7.6).
   - Such **restricted power** is incompatible with the limitless dominion of the Supreme Lord, who is declared in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad as:
     - **“The ruler of all beings, the protector of all beings, the bridge ensuring the non-disintegration of the worlds”** (Bṛhad. Up. 4.4.22).

---

#### **Analysis of the Pūrvapakṣa**

The pūrvapakṣa concludes that the Being described cannot be the Supreme Lord because:

1. **Form (Rūpavattva):**
   - The description of physical attributes like "golden beard" and "golden hair" aligns with a conditioned being, not the formless Paramātman.

2. **Dependence (Ādhāra):**
   - The references to "inside the sun" and "inside the eye" imply dependence, which contradicts the self-established and omnipresent nature of the Supreme Lord.

3. **Limited Dominion (Maryāda):**
   - The described powers are circumscribed to particular domains (celestial and terrestrial), unlike the Supreme Lord’s all-encompassing sovereignty.

---

### **Purpose of the Pūrvapakṣa**

This prima facie conclusion sets up the **basis for Śaṅkara’s refutation**. By articulating the arguments against the Supreme Lord’s identification with the Being described, Śaṅkara prepares to demonstrate how these objections are resolved through proper interpretation of the Upaniṣadic teaching.

Would you like to proceed to **Section 3**, where Śaṅkara refutes this interpretation and establishes the Being as the Supreme Lord?

### **Section 3: Refutation of the Pūrvapakṣa**

#### **Text**
> **तस्मान्नाक्ष्यादित्ययोरन्तः परमेश्वर इत्येवं प्राप्ते ब्रूमः — अन्तरस्तद्धर्मोपदेशात् इति।**
> ‘य एषोऽन्तरादित्ये’, ‘य एषोऽन्तरक्षिणि’ इति च श्रूयमाणः पुरुषः परमेश्वर एव, न संसारी।
> **कुतः? तद्धर्मोपदेशात्।**
> तस्य हि परमेश्वरस्य धर्मा इहोपदिष्टाः।
> तद्यथा — ‘तस्योदिति नाम’ इति श्रावयित्वा अस्यादित्यपुरुषस्य नाम ‘स एष सर्वेभ्यः पाप्मभ्य उदितः’ इति सर्वपाप्मापगमेन निर्वक्ति।

---

#### **Translation**

Thus, even though it appears from the prima facie reasoning that the entity described within the **sun (āditya)** and the **eye (akṣi)** is not the Supreme Lord (Paramātman), we declare:
- **"The Being inside is indeed the Supreme Lord, not a conditioned being."**

---

### **Reason for the Refutation**
The **Being inside the sun and the eye is the Supreme Lord** because **divine attributes (dharmas)** belonging to the Paramātman are specifically taught here.

1. **Removal of All Sins**
   - The text states that the Being inside the sun has the name **“He who rises” (uditi)** and removes all sins:
     - **“He has risen above all sins and removes all sins for those who know Him”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.6.7).
   - The same attribute is transferred to the Being inside the eye:
     - **“The name of the one inside is the same as the name of the one outside.”**
   - The removal of all sins is explicitly ascribed to the Paramātman in other Upaniṣadic teachings:
     - **“The Self is free from all sins”** (Chāndogya Up. 8.7.1).

2. **Universality of the Supreme Lord’s Attributes**
   - The Being is described as being identical with Ṛk, Sāma, and all sacred texts:
     - **“This is Ṛk, this is Sāma, this is Brahman”** (Chāndogya Up. 1.7.5).
   - Such universality aligns only with the Supreme Lord, who is the cause of everything and the essence of all.

---

### **Key Refutations of the Pūrvapakṣa**

#### 1. **Objection: Form (Rūpavattva)**
   - The golden form (beard, hair, etc.) described in the Upaniṣad is **māyā-based**, manifested by the Lord for the sake of aiding meditation (upāsanā).
   - Scriptural support for such māyā-based forms:
     - **“This form you see, Nārada, is created by My māyā”** (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva 12.339.45).
   - The Lord’s true nature remains formless and beyond sensory grasp.

#### 2. **Objection: Dependence (Ādhāra)**
   - The mention of the Lord being “inside the sun” or “inside the eye” is pedagogical, intended to aid seekers in focusing their meditation.
   - The Supreme Lord, like space (ākāśa), is all-pervading and independent:
     - **“He is established in His own majesty”** (Chāndogya Up. 7.24.1).
     - **“He is all-pervasive and eternal”** (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.6.3.2).

#### 3. **Objection: Limited Dominion (Maryāda)**
   - The texts describing the Lord’s governance of celestial (āditya) and terrestrial (akṣi) realms are context-specific and intended for meditative purposes.
   - The Supreme Lord’s true sovereignty is limitless, as stated in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad:
     - **“He is the Lord of all beings, the protector of all beings.”**

---

### **Resolution**

The objections regarding form, dependence, and limited dominion do not hold when interpreted properly:
1. The descriptions of form and location are meant for **meditation (upāsanā)** and not to be taken literally.
2. The Being described is the **Supreme Lord** (Paramātman), as evidenced by the divine attributes taught in the Upaniṣads.
3. The Upaniṣadic progression guides seekers to recognize the Lord’s true, formless, and all-encompassing nature.

Would you like to proceed to **Section 4**, where Śaṅkara reconciles the descriptions of form and formlessness in detail?

### **Section 4: Reconciling Form and Formlessness**

#### **Text**
> **तथा चाक्षुषे पुरुषे ‘सैव ऋक् तत्साम तदुक्थं तद्यजुस्तद्ब्रह्म’ इति ऋक्सामाद्यात्मकतां निर्धारयति।**
> **सा च परमेश्वरस्योपपद्यते, सर्वकारणत्वात्सर्वात्मकत्वोपपत्तेः।**

---

#### **Translation**

1. **Attributes of Ṛk, Sāma, and Brahman**
   - The Person described in the **eye (akṣi)** is declared to be:
     - **“Ṛk, Sāma, Uktha, Yajus, and Brahman itself.”**
   - This identity aligns perfectly with the **Supreme Lord (Paramātman)** because:
     - He is the **cause of everything (sarva-kāraṇatva)** and the **essence of all (sarvātmakatva)**.

2. **Resolution of the Objection to Form (Rūpavattva)**
   - It was objected that the golden form (golden beard, hair, etc.) attributed to this Being does not align with the formless nature of the Supreme Lord. Śaṅkara responds:
     - The Supreme Lord can assume **māyā-created forms** at His will to aid seekers in meditation and realization.
     - As stated in the Mahābhārata (Śānti Parva):
       - **“This form you see, Nārada, is created by My māyā.”**

---

### **Key Points in the Reconciliation**

1. **The Supreme Lord Encompasses Both Form and Formlessness**
   - **True Nature**: The Paramātman is formless (nirguṇa), as established in Upaniṣadic statements like:
     - **“Soundless, touchless, formless, and imperishable”** (Kaṭha Up. 1.3.15).
   - **Manifest Forms**: For the sake of upāsanā (meditation) and uplifting seekers, the Lord manifests in forms created through māyā.

2. **Māyā as a Pedagogical Tool**
   - Māyā-based forms, such as the **golden Person in the sun and the eye**, are intended to help practitioners focus their minds on the Paramātman.
   - These forms are not the ultimate reality but serve as **conceptual aids** for spiritual practice.

3. **Supreme Lord’s All-Encompassing Nature**
   - The identification of the Being with Ṛk, Sāma, and other sacred texts emphasizes the Lord’s **essence of all existence**.
   - This aligns with the Supreme Lord’s status as the **cause of everything** and the substratum of all creation.

---

### **Reconciliation Summary**

Śaṅkara resolves the apparent contradiction between form and formlessness by highlighting the duality of the Supreme Lord’s manifestation:
1. **As Nirguṇa (Formless):** The ultimate reality, beyond attributes and relationships.
2. **As Saguṇa (With Form):** Māyā-based forms used for meditative purposes, helping seekers transcend conditioned realities to realize the unconditioned.

Would you like to proceed to **Section 5**, where Śaṅkara addresses objections regarding dependence (ādhāra) and limited dominion (maryādā)?
### **Section 5: Addressing Dependence and Limited Dominion**

---

#### **Text**
> **यदप्याधारश्रवणान्न परमेश्वर इति, अत्रोच्यते — स्वमहिमप्रतिष्ठस्याप्याधारविशेषोपदेश उपासनार्थो भविष्यति।**
> **सर्वगतत्वाद्ब्रह्मणो व्योमवत्सर्वान्तरत्वोपपत्तेः।**

> **तस्मात्परमेश्वर एवाक्ष्यादित्ययोरन्तरुपदिश्यते।**

---

#### **Translation**

Śaṅkara addresses the objections regarding the dependence of the Being described and its limited dominion:

1. **Objection 1: Dependence (Ādhāra)**
   - **Objection**: The Being is described as being "inside the sun" or "inside the eye," which implies it is dependent on these locations.
   - **Śaṅkara’s Response**:
     - Such descriptions are meant **only for the purpose of meditation (upāsanā)** and do not reflect actual dependence.
     - Even the Supreme Lord, who is **self-established in His own glory (svamahimni pratiṣṭhita)**, is described in relation to specific locations to help seekers conceptualize and meditate on Him.

2. **Objection 2: Limited Dominion (Maryādā)**
   - **Objection**: The Being’s dominion appears restricted to certain realms:
     - **In the sun (āditya):** Governing the gods and celestial realms.
     - **In the eye (akṣi):** Governing humans and terrestrial realms.
   - **Śaṅkara’s Response**:
     - These descriptions of limited power reflect the **distinction between ādhyātma (individual level)** and **ādhidevatā (cosmic level)** meditations.
     - They are meant to guide seekers in worship and do not limit the Supreme Lord’s **true, unlimited sovereignty**.

3. **Ultimate Nature of Brahman**
   - The Supreme Lord is **all-pervading like space (ākāśa)**, supporting everything and existing within all beings (sarvāntratva).
   - The descriptions of location and dominion serve pedagogical purposes and do not contradict Brahman’s **infinite and independent nature**.

---

### **Key Points in the Resolution**

1. **Ādhāra (Substratum) Descriptions Are Pedagogical**
   - When the Supreme Lord is described as being "inside the sun" or "inside the eye," this is not literal but intended to **aid meditation** by providing a tangible focus for worship.
   - The Supreme Lord is self-established and needs no substratum.

2. **Apparent Limitations Reflect Meditative Contexts**
   - The distinctions between **ādhyātma (individual level)** and **ādhidevatā (cosmic level)** pertain to **specific meditative practices**, not to Brahman’s intrinsic nature.
   - The true sovereignty of Brahman is infinite, as described in other Upaniṣadic passages:
     - **“He is the Lord of all beings, the ruler and protector of all worlds”** (Bṛhad. Up. 4.4.22).

3. **Brahman’s All-Pervasiveness**
   - Brahman is compared to space, existing everywhere and within everything.
   - Its presence in specific locations (e.g., the sun, the eye) is part of its all-encompassing nature, not a limitation.

---

### **Resolution Summary**

Śaṅkara firmly establishes that:
1. Descriptions of dependence (ādhāra) and limited dominion (maryādā) are for meditative purposes and not literal truths about Brahman’s nature.
2. Brahman remains the **infinite, self-established, all-pervading reality**, with specific meditations serving as tools for realization.
3. These objections are resolved when viewed through the lens of **upāsanā (worship-oriented practice)** rather than ontological descriptions.

---

Would you like to proceed to **Section 6**, where Śaṅkara concludes by integrating these insights and reaffirming the Supreme Lord as "The Being Inside"?
### **Section 6: Śaṅkara’s Conclusion – The Supreme Lord as “The Being Inside”**

---

#### **Text**
> **तस्मात्परमेश्वर एवाक्ष्यादित्ययोरन्तरुपदिश्यते।**

---

#### **Translation**

Thus, it is concluded:
- The Being described as "inside the sun" (āditya) and "inside the eye" (akṣi) is none other than the **Supreme Lord (Paramātman)**.

---

### **Summary of Śaṅkara’s Conclusion**

Śaṅkara integrates his refutations and reconciliations to establish the following key points:

1. **Identity of the Being**
   - The Being described in the sun and the eye is not a conditioned being (saṃsārī) but the **Supreme Lord (Paramātman)**.
   - This is supported by:
     - The attribution of divine characteristics like removing sins and universal sovereignty.
     - The essence of Ṛk, Sāma, and Brahman being ascribed to this Being.

2. **Meditative Purpose of Scriptural Descriptions**
   - The descriptions of form (golden features), location (inside the sun and the eye), and limited dominion are pedagogical, designed to aid seekers in meditative focus (upāsanā).
   - These descriptions do not limit or condition the Supreme Lord, who is infinite and formless in essence.

3. **Brahman’s True Nature**
   - Brahman remains **nirguṇa (formless)** and independent, yet assumes **māyā-based forms** to facilitate realization.
   - Its all-pervasiveness (sarvāntratva) ensures its presence in both the macrocosm (āditya) and the microcosm (akṣi).

4. **Alignment with Upaniṣadic Teachings**
   - This interpretation aligns with the broader Upaniṣadic assertions of Brahman as:
     - **The substratum of all creation** (sarva-kāraṇatva).
     - **All-encompassing and infinite** (ananta).
     - **Beyond all conceptualizations** (neti neti).

---

### **Final Resolution**

Śaṅkara’s conclusion reaffirms the Supreme Lord as the true "Being Inside," transcending conditioned interpretations. He preserves the integrity of Advaita Vedānta by:
1. Distinguishing between Brahman’s essential formlessness and its manifest forms for meditative purposes.
2. Clarifying the pedagogical intent of descriptions that might appear contradictory or limited.
3. Establishing that the Paramātman alone is the ultimate reality present within both the cosmic and individual realms.
