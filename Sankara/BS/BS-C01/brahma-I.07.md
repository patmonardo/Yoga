### **Section 1: Introduction and Challenge to the Ātma as Pradhāna Argument**

#### **Text**
**अथोच्येत** — अचेतनेऽपि प्रधाने भवत्यात्मशब्दः, आत्मनः सर्वार्थकारित्वात्; यथा राज्ञः सर्वार्थकारिणि भृत्ये भवत्यात्मशब्दः ‘ममात्मा भद्रसेनः’ इति । प्रधानं हि पुरुषस्यात्मनो भोगापवर्गौ कुर्वदुपकरोति, राज्ञ इव भृत्यः सन्धिविग्रहादिषु वर्तमानः । अथवैक एवात्मशब्दश्चेतनाचेतनविषयो भविष्यति, ‘भूतात्मा’ ‘इन्द्रियात्मा’ इति च प्रयोगदर्शनात्; यथैक एव ज्योतिःशब्दः क्रतुज्वलनविषयः ।

#### **Explanation**
This section begins with the Sāṅkhya objection: the **term "Ātma"** can appropriately apply to Pradhāna despite its unconscious nature. The reasoning is as follows:

1. **Figurative Usage of Ātma:** Just as a king may refer to a servant (Bhadraseṇa) as "his self" due to their instrumental role in achieving royal purposes (e.g., diplomacy or war), Pradhāna serves as a means for the conscious Self (Puruṣa) to achieve **bhoga (enjoyment)** and **apavarga (liberation)**. Therefore, Pradhāna can also be called Ātma.

2. **Shared Application to Conscious and Unconscious:** The term **"Ātma"** is used both for conscious entities (e.g., the Self) and unconscious ones (e.g., **Bhūtātma, Indriyātma**). This linguistic flexibility is analogous to the word **"Jyoti"** (light), which can refer to fire or ritual light. Hence, Pradhāna can also bear the term Ātma.

---

#### **Key Argument**
The Sāṅkhyans justify their claim based on **functional utility** and **linguistic precedent**, arguing that Pradhāna’s role in facilitating Puruṣa's experience validates its identification as Ātma.

### **Section 2: The Refutation Begins – Ātma’s Incompatibility with Pradhāna**

#### **Text**
**तत्र कुत एतदात्मशब्दादीक्षतेरगौणत्वमित्यत उत्तरं पठति — तन्निष्ठस्य मोक्षोपदेशात् ॥ ७ ॥**

**न प्रधानमचेतनमात्मशब्दालम्बनं भवितुमर्हति । ‘स आत्मा’ इति प्रकृतं सदणिमानमादाय, ‘तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो’ इति चेतनस्य श्वेतकेतोर्मोक्षयितव्यस्य तन्निष्ठामुपदिश्य, ‘आचार्यवान्पुरुषो वेद तस्य तावदेव चिरं यावन्न विमोक्ष्येऽथ सम्पत्स्ये’ (छा. उ. ६ । १४ । २) इति मोक्षोपदेशात् ।**

---

#### **Explanation**
The Vedāntin replies with **Sūtra 7**: **“Tannishṭhasya Mokṣopadeśāt”** (The term Ātma applies to the conscious entity because it is the subject of liberation as taught in scripture).

1. **Primary Argument from the Scriptures:**
   - The **Chāndogya Upaniṣad (6.14.2)** teaches liberation (**mokṣa**) through knowledge of Ātma. For instance, the teaching **"Tat Tvam Asi"** addresses the conscious Śvetaketu, emphasizing that Ātma is both the essence of the universe and the means of liberation.
   - Liberation pertains to a **conscious being** (Puruṣa) capable of understanding and realization, not to an unconscious entity like Pradhāna.

2. **Contradiction in Identifying Pradhāna as Ātma:**
   - If Ātma, as Pradhāna, were unconscious, the **Upaniṣads’ teaching would be invalid**, leading to confusion for seekers (mumuṣu). A scripture advocating such an erroneous identification would fail its purpose of guiding individuals toward liberation and would be deemed **unreliable (apramāṇa)**.

---

#### **Key Argument**
The **scriptural context and intent (mokṣa-opadeśa)** clearly affirm that Ātma refers to a **conscious entity**, aligning with Śvetaketu’s inquiry. This excludes unconscious Pradhāna from being identified as Ātma.

### **Section 3: Logical Fallacy in Identifying Ātma with Pradhāna**

#### **Text**
**यदि ह्यचेतनं प्रधानं सच्छब्दवाच्यम् ‘तत् असि’ इति ग्राहयेत् मुमुक्षुं चेतनं सन्तमचेतनोऽसीति, तदा विपरीतवादि शास्त्रं पुरुषस्यानर्थायेत्यप्रमाणं स्यात् । न तु निर्दोषं शास्त्रमप्रमाणं कल्पयितुं युक्तम् ।**

---

#### **Explanation**
The Vedāntin argues against interpreting **Pradhāna as Ātma**, stating:

1. **Scriptural Integrity and Reliability:**
   - If **Pradhāna**, an unconscious entity, were equated with Ātma, then the teaching **"Tat Tvam Asi"** would mean **"You are an unconscious entity."**
   - Such an interpretation is **absurd** and goes against the intent of the scriptures, which are reliable guides to **truth and liberation**.
   - An unreliable scripture, giving rise to false conclusions, cannot serve its purpose as a valid pramāṇa (means of knowledge).

2. **Adverse Consequences for the Seeker (Mumukṣu):**
   - Teaching a seeker (**mumukṣu**) that they are unconscious (identifying Ātma with Pradhāna) would lead to **misguidance**, preventing realization of their true conscious nature.
   - This would ultimately result in **anartha** (harm) instead of mokṣa, defeating the very purpose of the Upaniṣads.

---

#### **Key Argument**
The **Upaniṣads’ central goal** is to lead seekers to liberation by revealing their **true nature (conscious Ātma)**. Associating Ātma with an unconscious entity like Pradhāna is both **logically untenable** and undermines the validity of scriptural teachings.

### **Section 4: Misinterpretation of Śāstra and Ātma’s True Nature**

#### **Text**
**यदि चाज्ञस्य सतो मुमुक्षोरचेतनमनात्मानमात्मेत्युपदिशेत्प्रमाणभूतं शास्त्रम् , स श्रद्दधानतया अन्धगोलाङ्गूलन्यायेन तदात्मदृष्टिं न परित्यजेत् , तद्व्यतिरिक्तं चात्मानं न प्रतिपद्येत । तथा सति पुरुषार्थाद्विहन्येत, अनर्थं च ऋच्छेत् ।**

---

#### **Explanation**
1. **Hypothetical Situation: Misleading Śāstra:**
   - If the Śāstra, regarded as a valid means of knowledge, incorrectly teaches the seeker (**mumukṣu**) to identify the unconscious Pradhāna as Ātma, the seeker would **accept this teaching blindly**.
   - Like the **blind following the blind (Andha-Golaṅgūla-Nyāya)**, the seeker would remain entrenched in the false view, failing to understand their true conscious nature.

2. **Consequence of False Teaching:**
   - The seeker would neither attain the true Ātma nor relinquish the wrong identification with Pradhāna.
   - This would result in:
     - **Loss of ultimate human purpose (puruṣārtha)**: Liberation (mokṣa) would remain unachieved.
     - **Anartha (harm)**: The seeker would perpetuate ignorance, suffering, and bondage.

---

#### **Key Argument**
The Śāstra cannot mislead seekers by identifying Ātma with unconscious Pradhāna because such an error:
- Undermines the fundamental reliability of Śāstra as a **pramāṇa**.
- Hinders liberation, the very purpose of scriptural teachings.

### **Section 5: Proper Scriptural Instruction and Ātma’s Nature**

#### **Text**
**तस्माद्यथा स्वर्गाद्यर्थिनोऽग्निहोत्रादिसाधनं यथाभूतमुपदिशति, तथा मुमुक्षोरपि ‘स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो’ इति यथाभूतमेवात्मानमुपदिशतीति युक्तम् । एवं च सति तप्तपरशुग्रहणमोक्षदृष्टान्तेन सत्याभिसन्धस्य मोक्षोपदेश उपपद्यते । अन्यथा ह्यमुख्ये सदात्मतत्त्वोपदेशे, ‘अहमुक्थमस्मीति विद्यात्’ (ऐ. आ. २ । १ । २ । ६) इतिवत्सम्पन्मात्रमिदमनित्यफलं स्यात् । तत्र मोक्षोपदेशो नोपपद्येत ।**

---

#### **Explanation**
1. **Correct Scriptural Methodology:**
   - Just as Śāstra correctly prescribes specific actions (e.g., **Agnihotra**) for those desiring heavenly realms (svarga), it must accurately teach the **true nature of Ātma** to seekers of liberation (**mumukṣus**).
   - Example: The Chāndogya Upaniṣad’s teaching to Śvetaketu: **“Sa Ātmā Tat Tvam Asi”** (That Ātma is you) delivers the true nature of the self.

2. **Use of Analogy for Mokṣa:**
   - Teaching liberation is valid and meaningful when the **truth about Ātma** is communicated sincerely, as shown by the **example of grasping a hot axe (taptaparaśu-dṛṣṭānta)**.
   - This represents the seeker’s firm conviction in the truth of the Śāstra and the resultant liberation.

3. **Invalidity of Misleading Instruction:**
   - If Śāstra taught an **incorrect or symbolic identity** of Ātma (e.g., identifying with Pradhāna), the outcome would be transient or ineffective, akin to symbolic rituals like “I am Uktha” from Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
   - Liberation is **eternal** and cannot result from instructions about temporary realities.

4. **Key Argument:**
   - Śāstra must teach Ātma **as it truly is** (Yathābhūta) for the teaching to align with the ultimate goal of liberation. Misleading teachings would invalidate the purpose of Śāstra and lead to **ephemeral, non-liberating results**.

### **Section 6: Rejection of Gauṇa and Universal Applications**

#### **Text**
**तस्मान्न सदणिमन्यात्मशब्दस्य गौणत्वम् । भृत्ये तु स्वामिभृत्यभेदस्य प्रत्यक्षत्वादुपपन्नो गौण आत्मशब्दः ‘ममात्मा भद्रसेनः’ इति । अपि च क्वचिद्गौणः शब्दो दृष्ट इति नैतावता शब्दप्रमाणकेऽर्थे गौणीकल्पना न्याय्या, सर्वत्रानाश्वासप्रसङ्गात् । यत्तूक्तं चेतनाचेतनयोः साधारण आत्मशब्दः, क्रतुज्वलनयोरिव ज्योतिःशब्द इति, तन्न । अनेकार्थत्वस्यान्याय्यत्वात् ।**

---

#### **Explanation**

1. **Rejection of Gauṇa Ātma Usage for Brahman:**
   - The **term “Ātma”** (Self) cannot be considered symbolic (**Gauṇa**) when referring to **Brahman**.
   - For instance, the term **“Mamatmā Bhadraseṇaḥ”** (myself is Bhadraseṇa) uses the word "Ātma" metaphorically because the **difference between master and servant** is evident. This metaphor does not apply to Brahman, as no such relational difference exists.

2. **Improper Gauṇa Application Across Contexts:**
   - Just because metaphorical usage is observed in some contexts does not mean it is justified to impose a **metaphorical or symbolic interpretation** universally.
   - Śāstra, as the source of **authoritative knowledge**, must rely on **literal meanings** for its validity. Introducing metaphorical interpretations arbitrarily would lead to **unreliability across scriptural texts**.

3. **Criticism of Universal Application of Ātma:**
   - The argument that “Ātma” applies universally to both sentient (**Cetanā**) and insentient (**Acetanā**) entities, akin to how **“Jyoti”** refers to both ritualistic fire and ordinary flames, is rejected.
   - Such **polysemic interpretations** (multiple meanings) are not valid when applied inconsistently across contexts, particularly in **authoritative scriptural usage**.

4. **Key Takeaway:**
   - **Ātma** retains its **primary meaning** of the **conscious self** and does not symbolically extend to inanimate entities like Pradhāna. The selective metaphorical application of such terms introduces inconsistencies and undermines the credibility of Śāstra.

### **Section 7: Clarification of Ātma in Context and the Rejection of Pradhāna**

---

#### **Text**
**तस्माच्चेतनविषय एव मुख्य आत्मशब्दश्चेतनत्वोपचाराद्भूतादिषु प्रयुज्यते — ‘भूतात्मा’ ‘इन्द्रियात्मा’ इति च । साधारणत्वेऽप्यात्मशब्दस्य न प्रकरणमुपपदं वा किञ्चिन्निश्चायकमन्तरेणान्यतरवृत्तिता निर्धारयितुं शक्यते । न चात्राचेतनस्य निश्चायकं किञ्चित्कारणमस्ति । प्रकृतं तु सदीक्षितृ, सन्निहितश्च चेतनः श्वेतकेतुः । न हि चेतनस्य श्वेतकेतोरचेतन आत्मा सम्भवतीत्यवोचाम । तस्माच्चेतनविषय इहात्मशब्द इति निश्चीयते ।**

---

#### **Explanation**

1. **Ātma is Primarily Conscious:**
   - The term **“Ātma”** (Self) primarily refers to a **conscious entity** and applies secondarily (metaphorically) to **insentient entities** like the **elements (Bhūta)** or **senses (Indriya)** only in contexts where their connection to consciousness is implied.
   - Examples like **“Bhūtātmā”** (Self of elements) and **“Indriyātmā”** (Self of senses) are cases where **insentient entities** are referred to as Ātma only because of their association with a conscious principle.

2. **Need for Contextual Support:**
   - Even if **Ātma** is occasionally used for insentient entities, it requires a **clear context (Prakaraṇa)** or **semantic justification (Upapada)** for such usage.
   - Without such context, it is inappropriate to assume **Ātma** applies universally, especially to **insentient Pradhāna**.

3. **Contextual Clarity in the Scriptural Example:**
   - In the scriptural narrative being discussed, **“Sadeva somya idam agra āsīt”** refers to **“Sat”** (Existence) as the cause, and **“Tattvamasi”** identifies the conscious individual (Śvetaketu) as non-different from Sat.
   - The **Śvetaketu example** explicitly connects **Ātma** to a **sentient, conscious self**, confirming that it cannot refer to an insentient Pradhāna.

4. **Key Takeaway:**
   - The **primary subject of Ātma** in this context is the conscious principle. The claim that **Pradhāna**, being insentient, could be Ātma is logically untenable and contextually unsupported.
