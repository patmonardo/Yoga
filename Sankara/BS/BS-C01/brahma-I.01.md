## **Section 1: Definition and Nature of Adhyāsa**

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> युष्मदस्मत्प्रत्ययगोचरयोर्विषयविषयिणोस्तमःप्रकाशवद्विरुद्धस्वभावयोरितरेतरभावानुपपत्तौ सिद्धायाम्, तद्धर्माणामपि सुतरामितरेतरभावानुपपत्तिः — इत्यतः अस्मत्प्रत्ययगोचरे विषयिणि चिदात्मके युष्मत्प्रत्ययगोचरस्य विषयस्य तद्धर्माणां चाध्यासः तद्विपर्ययेण विषयिणस्तद्धर्माणां च विषयेऽध्यासो मिथ्येति भवितुं युक्तम्।

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Yuṣmad-asmat-pratyaya-gocarayor-viṣaya-viṣayiṇos-tamaḥ-prakāśavad-viruddha-svabhāvayor-itaretara-bhāvānupapattau siddhāyām, taddharmāṇām-api sutarām-itaretara-bhāvānupapattiḥ—ityataḥ asmat-pratyaya-gocare viṣayiṇi cidātmake yuṣmad-pratyaya-gocarasya viṣayasya taddharmāṇāṃ ca adhyāsaḥ tadviparyayeṇa viṣayiṇas-taddharmāṇāṃ ca viṣaye’dhyāso mithyeti bhavituṃ yuktam.

#### **Translation:**
> The subject (viṣayī) and the object (viṣaya), which are apprehended through the notions of "I" (asmat) and "you" (yuṣmad) respectively, are inherently opposed in nature—like darkness and light—and cannot be mutually present. Their respective attributes are, therefore, also incapable of being mutually interrelated. Thus, the superimposition (adhyāsa) of the attributes of the object (yuṣmad) upon the subject (asmat), which is the conscious self (cidātman), and conversely, the superimposition of the attributes of the subject upon the object, is logically false (mithyā).

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Adhyāsa (अध्यास):**
   - Transliteration: Adhyāsa
   - Meaning: Superimposition; the erroneous attribution of properties from one entity to another.
   - Context: Fundamental ignorance where attributes of the non-self are imposed upon the self and vice versa.

2. **Yuṣmad (युष्मत्):**
   - Transliteration: Yuṣmad
   - Meaning: Refers to "you" or the object.
   - Context: Denotes the external, inert, or objective field of perception.

3. **Asmat (अस्मत्):**
   - Transliteration: Asmat
   - Meaning: Refers to "I" or the subject.
   - Context: Represents the conscious self or perceiving subject.

4. **Cidātman (चिदात्मन्):**
   - Transliteration: Cidātman
   - Meaning: The conscious self.
   - Context: The self as the substratum of awareness, distinct from inert objects.

5. **Mithyā (मिथ्या):**
   - Transliteration: Mithyā
   - Meaning: Falsehood or error.
   - Context: Denotes the unreality of superimposition; an apparent truth born of ignorance.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - The subject and object are inherently distinct and opposite in nature, like light and darkness. This distinction is fundamental and establishes that they cannot share attributes or mutually exist in each other’s domain.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - How can such superimposition occur if the subject and object are entirely distinct? Doesn't their opposition prevent any interaction?

3. **Resolution:**
   - The superimposition occurs due to ignorance (avidyā), which creates the illusion of mutual imposition. While logically untenable, this misapprehension underlies all worldly interactions and notions of "I" and "mine."

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - The concept of adhyāsa is central to Advaita. Ignorance (avidyā) leads to the apparent identification of the self with the non-self, resulting in bondage. The conscious self is distinct from objects but appears intertwined due to superimposition.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - Similar to Kant's notion of synthetic a priori judgments, adhyāsa reflects the interplay of subject and object as an apparent conflation driven by ignorance, not by their true natures.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 1:**
Śaṅkara defines **adhyāsa** as the mutual superimposition of attributes between the subject (self) and the object (non-self). This error, driven by ignorance, forms the basis of all empirical interactions and misperceptions in the world. Understanding and dissolving this adhyāsa is the first step in realizing the non-dual self.

## **Section 2: Philosophical Objection and Śaṅkara’s Response**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> आह — कोऽयमध्यासो नामेति। उच्यते — स्मृतिरूपः परत्र पूर्वदृष्टावभासः। तं केचित् अन्यत्रान्यधर्माध्यास इति वदन्ति। केचित्तु यत्र यदध्यासः तद्विवेकाग्रहणिबन्धनो भ्रम इति। अन्ये तु यत्र यदध्यासः तस्यैव विपरीतधर्मत्वकल्पनामाचक्षते। सर्वथापि तु अन्यस्यान्यधर्मावभासतां न व्यभिचरति। तथा च लोकेऽनुभवः — शुक्तिका हि रजतवदवभासते, एकश्चन्द्रः सद्वितीयवदिति।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Āha — ko’yam adhyāso nāmeti? Ucyate — smṛtirūpaḥ paratra pūrvadṛṣṭāvabhāsaḥ. Taṃ kecit anyatrānyadharmādhyāsa iti vadanti. Kecittu yatra yadadhyāsaḥ tadvivekāgrahaṇibandhano bhrama iti. Anye tu yatra yadadhyāsaḥ tasyaiva viparītadharmatvakalpanām ācakṣate. Sarvathāpi tu anyasyānyadharmāvabhāsatāṃ na vyabhicarati. Tathā ca loke’nubhavaḥ — śuktikā hi rajatavadavabhāsate, ekaścandraḥ sadvitīyavaditi.

---

#### **Translation:**
> The question is raised: “What is this superimposition (adhyāsa)?” It is answered: Superimposition is the appearance of something previously perceived (or remembered) in a different location. Some say that it is the imposition of the properties of one thing upon another. Others describe it as a delusion (bhrama) caused by the failure to distinguish (viveka) between two things. Yet others state that it involves imagining the properties of one thing to be entirely opposite to its true nature. In any case, it invariably involves the attribution of the qualities of one thing to another. This is corroborated by common experience, as when nacre appears as silver or the single moon appears as double.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Smṛtirūpaḥ (स्मृतिरूपः):**
   - Transliteration: Smṛtirūpaḥ
   - Meaning: Of the nature of memory.
   - Context: Adhyāsa involves memory-based cognition, where a previous experience influences the perception of a different context.

2. **Vivekāgrahaṇa (विवेकाग्रहण):**
   - Transliteration: Vivekāgrahaṇa
   - Meaning: Failure to distinguish.
   - Context: Ignorance of the distinctness of subject and object leads to superimposition.

3. **Bhrama (भ्रम):**
   - Transliteration: Bhrama
   - Meaning: Delusion or misapprehension.
   - Context: The error arising from ignorance, manifesting as adhyāsa.

4. **Śuktikā-Rajata (शुक्तिका-रजत):**
   - Transliteration: Śuktikā-Rajata
   - Meaning: Nacre-silver.
   - Context: A classical example of superimposition where nacre is mistaken for silver.

5. **Ekacandra-Dvitīya (एकचन्द्र-द्वितीय):**
   - Transliteration: Ekacandra-Dvitīya
   - Meaning: Single moon-double moon.
   - Context: Another common example where the single moon is perceived as two due to defective vision.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Adhyāsa is identified as the appearance of something in a context where it does not belong. This may involve imposing properties, failure to distinguish, or imagining opposing attributes.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - Adhyāsa is questioned for its basis. How can something already perceived or remembered appear erroneously in a different context? Isn’t this an illogical conflation?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara resolves this by pointing to common experiential errors like nacre-silver and double moon, illustrating how superimposition naturally occurs under ignorance. These examples show that such misattributions are neither rare nor baseless but arise from the fundamental inability to distinguish reality from appearances.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - Adhyāsa explains the illusion of duality. The individual self (jīva) mistakenly attributes qualities of the inert world (prakṛti) to itself, perpetuating ignorance. This section establishes the mechanism by which the error of individuality arises.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - The failure of *viveka* (discernment) aligns with the Kantian failure to distinguish between phenomena (appearances) and noumena (things-in-themselves). This parallels Śaṅkara’s view where appearances dominate until true knowledge dispels ignorance.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 2:**
Śaṅkara systematically defines **adhyāsa** as the erroneous superimposition caused by ignorance. By providing relatable examples (nacre-silver, double moon), he bridges abstract philosophical ideas with tangible experiences, preparing the ground for deeper arguments. This section reinforces the centrality of ignorance in perpetuating the illusion of duality.

## **Section 3: Examples and Illustrations of Adhyāsa**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> सर्वथापि तु अन्यस्यान्यधर्मावभासतां न व्यभिचरति। तथा च लोकेऽनुभवः — शुक्तिका हि रजतवदवभासते, एकश्चन्द्रः सद्वितीयवदिति।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Sarvathāpi tu anyasyānyadharmāvabhāsatāṃ na vyabhicarati. Tathā ca loke’nubhavaḥ — śuktikā hi rajatavadavabhāsate, ekaścandraḥ sadvitīyavaditi.

---

#### **Translation:**
> In all cases, superimposition invariably involves the appearance of the attributes of one thing upon another. This is corroborated by common experience: nacre appears as silver, and a single moon appears as double.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Śuktikā (शुक्तिका):**
   - Transliteration: Śuktikā
   - Meaning: Nacre (mother-of-pearl).
   - Context: Used as an example of superimposition where nacre is mistaken for silver.

2. **Rajatavad (रजतवत्):**
   - Transliteration: Rajatavad
   - Meaning: Appearing as silver.
   - Context: The mistaken identification of nacre as silver illustrates how superimposition occurs in perception.

3. **Ekaścandra (एकश्चन्द्र):**
   - Transliteration: Ekaścandra
   - Meaning: Single moon.
   - Context: The moon, though singular, may appear as two due to defective vision or conditions, serving as an example of misperception.

4. **Dvitīya (द्वितीय):**
   - Transliteration: Dvitīya
   - Meaning: Double or second.
   - Context: Refers to the erroneous perception of two moons instead of one.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Adhyāsa is supported by observable phenomena where attributes of one object are erroneously perceived in another, as in the nacre-silver example or the double-moon illusion.

2. **Illustrative Examples:**
   - **Nacre-Silver:** Nacre is perceived as silver due to a combination of distance, lighting, and preconceived notions, exemplifying how ignorance leads to misattribution.
   - **Double Moon:** The moon appears as two because of visual impairment or distortions, showing how perception is subject to error.

3. **Philosophical Implication:**
   - These examples serve to demonstrate the universality and inevitability of superimposition in human experience. Śaṅkara uses these relatable errors to underline the deeper philosophical error of confusing the self with the non-self.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - The examples reinforce the pervasive nature of adhyāsa, showing how even mundane perceptions are affected by ignorance. The misidentification of the self (ātman) with the body-mind complex (anātman) is rooted in the same mechanism as nacre-silver or double-moon errors.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - These examples echo Kant’s notion of *apperception*, where the synthesis of sensory data and prior concepts can lead to errors in understanding. The nacre-silver and double-moon examples illustrate how appearances are mistaken for reality.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 3:**
Śaṅkara illustrates adhyāsa with relatable examples to ground the concept in experience. By showing how nacre is mistaken for silver and the moon for double, he builds a bridge from everyday perception errors to the more profound error of self-identification with the non-self.

---

## **Section 4: Adhyāsa and the Self**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> कथं पुनः प्रत्यगात्मन्यविषये अध्यासो विषयतद्धर्माणाम्?
सर्वो हि पुरोऽवस्थित एव विषये विषयान्तरमध्यस्यति; युष्मत्प्रत्ययापेतस्य च प्रत्यगात्मनः अविषयत्वं ब्रवीषि।
उच्यते — न तावदयमेकान्तेनाविषयः, अस्मत्प्रत्ययविषयत्वात् अपरोक्षत्वाच्च प्रत्यगात्मप्रसिद्धेः।
न चायमस्ति नियमः — पुरोऽवस्थित एव विषये विषयान्तरमध्यसितव्यमिति।
अप्रत्यक्षेऽपि ह्याकाशे बालाः तलमलिनतादि अध्यस्यन्ति।
एवमविरुद्धः प्रत्यगात्मन्यपि अनात्माध्यासः।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Kathaṃ punaḥ pratyagātmanyaviṣaye adhyāso viṣaya-taddharmāṇām?
Sarvo hi puro'vasthita eva viṣaye viṣayāntaram adhyasyati; yuṣmat-pratyayāpetasya ca pratyagātmanaḥ aviṣayatvaṃ bravīṣi.
Ucyate — na tāvadayam ekāntena aviṣayaḥ, asmat-pratyaya-viṣayatvāt aparokṣatvācca pratyagātma-prasiddheḥ.
Na cāyam asti niyamaḥ — puro'vasthita eva viṣaye viṣayāntaram adhyasitavyam iti.
Apratyakṣe'pi hyākāśe bālāḥ talamalinatādi adhyasyanti.
Evam aviruddhaḥ pratyagātmany api anātmādhyāsaḥ.

---

#### **Translation:**
> How, then, can there be superimposition of the qualities of the object (viṣaya) and its attributes upon the inner self (pratyagātmā), which is not an object of perception?
It is observed that superimposition occurs only with objects that are directly present to perception. Furthermore, you claim that the inner self, being devoid of the "you" concept (yuṣmat-pratyaya), cannot be an object.
To this, it is answered: The inner self is not entirely beyond the scope of perception, for it is directly experienced as "I" (asmat-pratyaya) and is well-known as immediate and self-evident.
Moreover, there is no rule that superimposition occurs only on directly perceived objects. Even children, for instance, superimpose features like dirt or clouds upon the sky, which is not a directly perceived object.
Thus, it is not contradictory that the non-self (anātman) is superimposed upon the inner self (pratyagātmā).

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Pratyagātmā (प्रत्यगात्मा):**
   - Transliteration: Pratyagātmā
   - Meaning: Inner self.
   - Context: The self that is immediate and self-luminous, distinct from objects.

2. **Aviṣaya (अविषय):**
   - Transliteration: Aviṣaya
   - Meaning: Non-object.
   - Context: Refers to the self as being beyond objectification or external perception.

3. **Asmat-Pratyaya (अस्मत्प्रत्यय):**
   - Transliteration: Asmat-Pratyaya
   - Meaning: Notion of "I."
   - Context: Indicates the immediate awareness of the self as a subject.

4. **Apratyakṣa (अप्रत्यक्ष):**
   - Transliteration: Apratyakṣa
   - Meaning: Non-perceptible or not directly visible.
   - Context: Used to describe the sky in the example where dirt is superimposed by children.

5. **Anātman (अनात्मन्):**
   - Transliteration: Anātman
   - Meaning: Non-self.
   - Context: Refers to objects and their attributes mistakenly imposed upon the self.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Superimposition of object-like attributes (viṣaya-dharmas) onto the self (pratyagātmā) is not invalid simply because the self is not an object of direct perception. The self is immediate and evident through direct experience.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - Superimposition can occur only with objects of direct perception (like nacre or the moon). Since the self (pratyagātmā) is not an object, how can the attributes of the non-self be imposed upon it?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara refutes this by showing that superimposition does not require direct perceptibility. The example of children superimposing dirt on the sky illustrates how even subtle or non-directly perceived entities can serve as substrates for superimposition. Similarly, the self, being self-evident, can be a locus of adhyāsa.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - This section deepens the understanding of adhyāsa by showing how the self (ātman) becomes the locus of imposed attributes due to ignorance. The apparent duality between subject (ātman) and object (anātman) is perpetuated by this superimposition.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - The self-evidence of the subject (asmat-pratyaya) mirrors Kant's *apperception*, where the "I" is the foundation of all perception and thought. The imposition of external qualities upon this self aligns with the interplay of phenomena and noumena.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 4:**
Śaṅkara establishes that the self, though not an object of external perception, is immediate and self-evident, making it a valid locus for the superimposition of non-self attributes. He uses logical examples (e.g., the sky) to dismantle objections and reaffirms the role of ignorance in creating the illusion of self-object duality.

---

## **Section 5: Practical Implications of Adhyāsa**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> तमेतमेवंलक्षणमध्यासं पण्डिता अविद्येति मन्यन्ते। तद्विवेकेन च वस्तुस्वरूपावधारणं विद्यामाहुः।
तत्रैवं सति, यत्र यदध्यासः, तत्कृतेन दोषेण गुणेन वा अणुमात्रेणापि स न सम्बध्यते।
तमेतमविद्याख्यमात्मानात्मनोरितरेतराध्यासं पुरस्कृत्य सर्वे प्रमाणप्रमेयव्यवहारा लौकिका वैदिकाश्च प्रवृत्ताः।
सर्वाणि च शास्त्राणि विधिप्रतिषेधमोक्षपराणि।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Tametam evaṃlakṣaṇam adhyāsaṃ paṇḍitā avidyeti manyante. Tadvivekena ca vastusvarūpāvadhāraṇaṃ vidyām āhuḥ.
Tatra evaṃ sati, yatra yad adhyāsaḥ, tatkṛtena doṣeṇa guṇena vā aṇumātreṇa api sa na sambadhyate.
Tametam avidyākhyam ātmānātmanor itaretarādhyāsaṃ puraskṛtya sarve pramāṇa-prameya-vyavahārā laukikā vaidikāś ca pravṛttāḥ.
Sarvāṇi ca śāstrāṇi vidhi-pratiṣedha-mokṣaparāṇi.

---

#### **Translation:**
> This superimposition (adhyāsa), characterized as described, is regarded by the wise as ignorance (avidyā). Its opposite, the discrimination (viveka) of the true nature of reality, is called knowledge (vidyā).
When this is understood, the self is not affected even in the slightest by the merits or defects resulting from the superimposition.
Based on this mutual superimposition of the self (ātman) and non-self (anātman), known as ignorance (avidyā), all worldly and scriptural transactions concerning means of knowledge (pramāṇa) and objects of knowledge (prameya) proceed.
Indeed, all scriptures concerned with injunctions, prohibitions, and liberation are rooted in this superimposition.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Avidyā (अविद्या):**
   - Transliteration: Avidyā
   - Meaning: Ignorance; the root cause of misperception.
   - Context: The mistaken identification of the self with the non-self is termed avidyā.

2. **Vidyā (विद्या):**
   - Transliteration: Vidyā
   - Meaning: Knowledge or true understanding.
   - Context: The discrimination (viveka) of the real (self) from the unreal (non-self) leads to liberation.

3. **Pramāṇa (प्रमाण):**
   - Transliteration: Pramāṇa
   - Meaning: Means of knowledge.
   - Context: The tools or instruments used for acquiring knowledge, such as perception or inference.

4. **Prameya (प्रमेय):**
   - Transliteration: Prameya
   - Meaning: Object of knowledge.
   - Context: The entities or truths to be known through pramāṇas.

5. **Vidhi-Pratiṣedha (विधि-प्रतिषेध):**
   - Transliteration: Vidhi-Pratiṣedha
   - Meaning: Injunctions and prohibitions.
   - Context: Scriptural commands concerning what is to be done (vidhi) and avoided (pratiṣedha).

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Adhyāsa (superimposition) is the root cause of ignorance (avidyā), which underpins all worldly and scriptural interactions. Liberation (mokṣa) lies in transcending this ignorance through knowledge (vidyā).

2. **Practical Implication:**
   - All human activity, both mundane and spiritual, is predicated upon adhyāsa. This includes:
     - Worldly interactions (laukika vyavahāra).
     - Scriptural practices (vaidika vyavahāra), such as following injunctions and prohibitions.

3. **Liberation (Mokṣa):**
   - The self, being distinct and unaffected by the non-self, remains untouched by the consequences of superimposition. Discrimination (viveka) between the real (self) and unreal (non-self) leads to liberation.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - Adhyāsa is the foundational concept that explains how ignorance leads to bondage and how knowledge liberates. All scriptural practices aim to dissolve this superimposition, revealing the self's true nature.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - The interplay of pramāṇa (means of knowledge) and prameya (objects of knowledge) mirrors the Kantian synthesis of perception and concepts. Just as Kant posits a necessary but erroneous framework for empirical knowledge, Śaṅkara attributes all empirical and scriptural activity to adhyāsa.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 5:**
Śaṅkara identifies adhyāsa as the basis of ignorance and, consequently, all worldly and scriptural activity. The self, however, remains untouched by this error, and liberation is achieved through the realization of its true nature. This section bridges theoretical concepts with practical implications, emphasizing the universality of adhyāsa and its transcendence through knowledge.

---

## **Section 6: Resolution Through Knowledge**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> तमेतमविद्याख्यमात्मानात्मनोरितरेतराध्यासं पुरस्कृत्य सर्वे प्रमाणप्रमेयव्यवहारा लौकिका वैदिकाश्च प्रवृत्ताः।
अस्यानर्थहेतोः प्रहाणाय आत्मैकत्वविद्याप्रतिपत्तये सर्वे वेदान्ता आरभ्यन्ते।
यथा चायमर्थः सर्वेषां वेदान्तानाम्, तथा वयमस्यां शारीरकमीमांसायां प्रदर्शयिष्यामः।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Tametam avidyākhyam ātmānātmanor itaretarādhyāsaṃ puraskṛtya sarve pramāṇa-prameya-vyavahārā laukikā vaidikāś ca pravṛttāḥ.
Asyānartha-hetoḥ prahāṇāya ātmaikatva-vidyā-pratipattaye sarve vedāntā ārabhyante.
Yathā cāyam arthaḥ sarveṣāṃ vedāntānām, tathā vayam asyāṃ śārīrakamīmāṃsāyāṃ pradarśayiṣyāmaḥ.

---

#### **Translation:**
> Based on this mutual superimposition (adhyāsa) of the self (ātman) and the non-self (anātman), known as ignorance (avidyā), all worldly and scriptural transactions (pramāṇa-prameya vyavahāra) proceed.
To eliminate this cause of misfortune, and to establish the knowledge of the oneness of the self (ātmaikatva-vidyā), all Vedāntic scriptures are undertaken.
The purport of all Vedāntas is the same, and we will demonstrate this in the present inquiry into the nature of the embodied self (Śārīraka Mīmāṃsā).

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Ātmā (आत्मा):**
   - Transliteration: Ātmā
   - Meaning: The self.
   - Context: Refers to the true, non-dual essence of existence.

2. **Avidyā (अविद्या):**
   - Transliteration: Avidyā
   - Meaning: Ignorance.
   - Context: The mutual superimposition of self and non-self, causing bondage.

3. **Ātmaikatva-vidyā (आत्मैकत्वविद्या):**
   - Transliteration: Ātmaikatva-vidyā
   - Meaning: Knowledge of the oneness of the self.
   - Context: The realization that the individual self and the ultimate reality are one.

4. **Śārīraka Mīmāṃsā (शारीरकमिमांसा):**
   - Transliteration: Śārīraka Mīmāṃsā
   - Meaning: Inquiry into the embodied self.
   - Context: Refers to the Brahma Sutra, as it deals with the nature of the individual self and ultimate reality.

5. **Vedānta (वेदान्त):**
   - Transliteration: Vedānta
   - Meaning: The end of the Vedas; Upaniṣadic teachings.
   - Context: The corpus of teachings aimed at realizing the ultimate truth.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Ignorance (avidyā) is the root cause of all duality and suffering. The solution lies in the realization of the self's non-duality (ātmaikatva-vidyā), which dispels ignorance.

2. **Scriptural Aim:**
   - The Vedāntas, including the Brahma Sutra, aim to reveal the unity of the self and reality. Śaṅkara highlights that all Vedāntic teachings converge on this ultimate truth.

3. **Process of Resolution:**
   - Through systematic inquiry (mīmāṃsā), one discerns the self from the non-self and understands the illusory nature of superimposition. This leads to liberation (mokṣa).

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - The ultimate purpose of all spiritual practice is to transcend ignorance through the realization of ātmaikatva (oneness of the self). This is achieved by studying Vedāntic scriptures, reflecting on their teachings, and meditating upon the self.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - The elimination of ignorance parallels the Kantian idea of moving beyond appearances (phenomena) to grasp the noumenon (thing-in-itself). Similarly, Śaṅkara emphasizes moving beyond the illusion of duality to realize the underlying unity.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 6:**
Śaṅkara concludes that the mutual superimposition of self and non-self (adhyāsa), rooted in ignorance, drives all worldly and scriptural activities. The Vedāntas aim to dispel this ignorance by revealing the non-dual nature of the self. The Brahma Sutra serves as a systematic inquiry into this truth, demonstrating that liberation lies in the realization of ātmaikatva.

## **Analysis Plan for Sutra I.1.1 and Śaṅkara’s Bhāṣya**

The sutra and commentary for **Brahma Sutra I.1.1 (Jijñāsādhikaraṇam)** is dense and layered with philosophical significance. To effectively analyze it, we will proceed section-by-section as follows:

---

### **Proposed Sections:**

#### **Section 1: The Meaning of the Sutra**
- **Text:**
  "अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा ॥"
  Discuss the literal and philosophical meaning of the sutra, focusing on:
  - The role of **atha** (अथ) and **ataḥ** (अतः).
  - Why the inquiry into Brahman (Brahmajijñāsā) is necessary.
  - Śaṅkara's distinction between Brahmajijñāsā and other inquiries (e.g., Dharmājijñāsā).

#### **Section 2: Prerequisites for Brahmajijñāsā**
- Śaṅkara's elaboration on the qualifications required for the inquiry:
  - **Nityānitya-vastu-viveka** (discrimination between the eternal and the transient).
  - **Ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhoga-vairāgya** (dispassion toward enjoyment in this world and beyond).
  - **Śama, dama, etc.** (mental discipline and ethical qualities).
  - **Mumukṣutva** (desire for liberation).

#### **Section 3: Purpose and Scope of Brahmajijñāsā**
- Why the inquiry into Brahman is distinct from inquiries into other topics.
- Śaṅkara’s argument for Brahman as the ultimate purpose of life, compared to dharma, which is concerned with transient results.

#### **Section 4: Nature of Brahman**
- Śaṅkara's definition of Brahman, referencing the second sutra:
  "जन्माद्यस्य यतः" (Janmādyasya yataḥ).
- Dismissal of alternative meanings of the word "Brahman," emphasizing its root (bṛh, "to expand") and attributes like omniscience and omnipotence.

#### **Section 5: Common Misconceptions About Brahman**
- Śaṅkara addresses various erroneous views:
  - Materialists (Lokāyatikas) equate the self with the body.
  - Others identify the self with the senses, mind, or momentary consciousness.
  - Śaṅkara refutes these with scriptural support and reasoning.

#### **Section 6: The Need for Inquiry**
- Śaṅkara explains the necessity of systematic inquiry due to conflicting views about the nature of Brahman:
  - Without inquiry, misunderstanding could lead to incorrect practices and hinder liberation.
  - Emphasis on Vedāntic scriptures and reasoning aligned with them as tools for inquiry.

## **Section 1: The Meaning of the Sutra**

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा ॥

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Athāto brahmajijñāsā.

---

#### **Translation:**
> Now, therefore, the inquiry into Brahman.

---

#### **Śaṅkara’s Commentary Highlights:**
1. **Atha (अथ):**
   - Śaṅkara interprets "atha" as indicating a beginning or sequence:
     - **Sequence (ānantaratva):** The inquiry into Brahman follows preparation, such as the study of Vedānta and the cultivation of the requisite qualifications.
     - It is **not** an injunction (adhikāra), as Brahmajijñāsā does not depend on external qualifications like ritual studies.

2. **Ataḥ (अतः):**
   - Indicates causality or reason:
     - The inquiry into Brahman arises from the recognition of the transitory nature of worldly enjoyments and the desire for liberation.
     - Supported by scriptural statements like "ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम्" (The knower of Brahman attains the Supreme).

3. **Brahmajijñāsā (ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा):**
   - Śaṅkara defines this as the desire to know Brahman, which is distinct from knowing dharma or other subjects:
     - **Dharma:** Concerned with ritual actions and their results (transient outcomes).
     - **Brahman:** Leads to eternal liberation and is not dependent on action.

4. **Scriptural Support for Inquiry:**
   - Śruti passages emphasize Brahman as the ultimate purpose:
     - "यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते" (From which all beings are born).
     - "तद्विजिज्ञासस्व" (That is to be inquired into).

---

#### **Key Terms Analysis:**
1. **Jijñāsā (जिज्ञासा):**
   - Transliteration: Jijñāsā
   - Meaning: Desire to know.
   - Context: Refers to the inquiry into Brahman, driven by the recognition of ignorance and the desire for liberation.

2. **Brahman (ब्रह्मन्):**
   - Transliteration: Brahman
   - Meaning: The ultimate reality, characterized by omniscience and omnipotence.
   - Context: Defined in the next sutra as "the source of all creation" (janmādyasya yataḥ).

3. **Atha (अथ):**
   - Transliteration: Atha
   - Meaning: Now; marks a beginning.
   - Context: Indicates the readiness to embark on the inquiry into Brahman.

4. **Ataḥ (अतः):**
   - Transliteration: Ataḥ
   - Meaning: Therefore; indicates causality.
   - Context: Suggests that the inquiry into Brahman is warranted due to its supreme purpose.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 1:**
The first sutra, "Athāto brahmajijñāsā," succinctly establishes the purpose and necessity of the inquiry into Brahman. Śaṅkara clarifies that this inquiry arises from a prepared mind seeking liberation, distinguishing it from inquiries into ritual or mundane knowledge.

---

## **Section 2: Prerequisites for Brahmajijñāsā**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> उच्यते — नित्यानित्यवस्तुविवेकः, इहामुत्रार्थफलभोगविरागः, शमदमादिसाधनसम्पत्, मुमुक्षुत्वं च।
> तेषु हि सत्सु, प्रागपि धर्मजिज्ञासाया ऊर्ध्वं च, शक्यते ब्रह्म जिज्ञासितुं ज्ञातुं च; न विपर्यये।
> तस्मात् अथशब्देन यथोक्तसाधनसम्पत्त्यानन्तर्यमुपदिश्यते।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Ucyate — nityānityavastu-vivekaḥ, ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhoga-vairāgyaḥ, śama-damādi-sādhana-sampat, mumukṣutvaṃ ca.
> Teṣu hi satsu, prāg api dharmajijñāsāyā ūrdhvaṃ ca, śakyate brahma jijñāsituṃ jñātuṃ ca; na viparyaye.
> Tasmāt athaśabdena yathokta-sādhana-sampattānantaryam upadiśyate.

---

#### **Translation:**
> It is said: Discrimination between the eternal and the transient (nityānitya-vastu-viveka), dispassion toward enjoyment of results in this world and beyond (ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhoga-vairāgya), the possession of mental discipline and ethical qualities (śama-damādi-sādhana-sampat), and a desire for liberation (mumukṣutva) are prerequisites.
> When these prerequisites are present, whether before or after the inquiry into dharma, it is possible to inquire into and know Brahman. Otherwise, it is not.
> Therefore, the term "atha" (now) implies the presence of these qualifications.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Nityānitya-vastu-viveka (नित्यानित्यवस्तुविवेक):**
   - Transliteration: Nityānitya-vastu-viveka
   - Meaning: Discrimination between the eternal (nitya) and the transient (anitya).
   - Context: The ability to discern what is unchanging (Brahman) and what is impermanent (worldly objects).

2. **Ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhoga-vairāgya (इहामुत्रार्थफलभोगविराग):**
   - Transliteration: Ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhoga-vairāgya
   - Meaning: Dispassion toward enjoyment of results in this world (iha) and beyond (amutra).
   - Context: A necessary detachment from material and otherworldly rewards, indicating readiness for the inquiry into Brahman.

3. **Śama-Dama-Ādi-Sādhana-Sampat (शमदमादिसाधनसम्पत्):**
   - Transliteration: Śama-Dama-Ādi-Sādhana-Sampat
   - Meaning: The collection of mental and ethical disciplines.
   - Includes:
     - **Śama (शम):** Control of the mind.
     - **Dama (दम):** Control of the senses.
     - Other virtues like endurance, faith, and concentration.

4. **Mumukṣutva (मुमुक्षुत्व):**
   - Transliteration: Mumukṣutva
   - Meaning: Desire for liberation.
   - Context: The burning desire to transcend bondage and realize Brahman.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - The inquiry into Brahman is possible only when the prerequisites (discrimination, detachment, discipline, and liberation-desire) are met.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - Why are these qualifications necessary? Could not the inquiry into Brahman itself generate the needed qualities?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara argues that without the readiness provided by these prerequisites, the inquiry into Brahman is futile. A mind distracted by transient desires or lacking discipline cannot grasp the subtleties of Brahman, which requires focused contemplation and a purified intellect.

4. **Connection to Dharma Inquiry:**
   - Unlike the inquiry into dharma, which is action-oriented, Brahmajijñāsā seeks eternal truth. This distinction justifies the higher level of preparation required for the latter.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - These qualifications align with the traditional Advaitic emphasis on **sādhana-catuṣṭaya** (fourfold qualifications) as prerequisites for liberation:
     - Viveka (discrimination), Vairāgya (dispassion), Śama-Dama (discipline), and Mumukṣutva (desire for liberation).

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - Similar to Kant's emphasis on the role of preparation (e.g., ethical life) for engaging with transcendental philosophy, Śaṅkara highlights the need for internal readiness to inquire into Brahman.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 2:**
Śaṅkara identifies four essential prerequisites for Brahmajijñāsā: discrimination, dispassion, mental discipline, and the desire for liberation. These qualities prepare the seeker to engage meaningfully with the inquiry into Brahman, distinguishing it from inquiries into transient or action-based goals.

---

## **Section 3: Purpose and Scope of Brahmajijñāsā**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> धर्मब्रह्मजिज्ञासयोः फलजिज्ञास्यभेदाच्च।
> अभ्युदयफलं धर्मज्ञानम्, तच्चानुष्ठानापेक्षम्; निःश्रेयसफलं तु ब्रह्मविज्ञानम्, न चानुष्ठानान्तरापेक्षम्।
> भव्यश्च धर्मो जिज्ञास्यो न ज्ञानकालेऽस्ति, पुरुषव्यापारतन्त्रत्वात्।
> इह तु भूतं ब्रह्म जिज्ञास्यं नित्यत्वान्न पुरुषव्यापारतन्त्रम्।
> चोदनाप्रवृत्तिभेदाच्च।
> या हि चोदना धर्मस्य लक्षणं सा स्वविषये नियुञ्जानैव पुरुषमवबोधयति।
> ब्रह्मचोदना तु पुरुषमवबोधयत्येव केवलम्।
> अवबोधस्य चोदनाजन्यत्वात्, न पुरुषोऽवबोधे नियुज्यते।
> यथा अक्षार्थसन्निकर्षेणार्थावबोधे, तद्वत्।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Dharmabrahmajijñāsayoḥ phalajijñāsyabhedācca.
> Abhyudayaphalaṃ dharmajñānam, taccānuṣṭhānāpekṣam; niḥśreyasaphalaṃ tu brahmavijñānam, na cānuṣṭhānāntarāpekṣam.
> Bhavyaśca dharmo jijñāsyo na jñānakāle'sti, puruṣavyāpāratantratvāt.
> Iha tu bhūtaṃ brahma jijñāsyaṃ nityatvānna puruṣavyāpāratantram.
> Codanāpravṛttibhedācca.
> Yā hi codanā dharmasya lakṣaṇaṃ sā svaviṣaye niyuñjānaiva puruṣamavabodhayati.
> Brahmacodanā tu puruṣamavabodhayatyeva kevalam.
> Avabodhasya codanājanayatvāt, na puruṣo'vabodhe niyujyate.
> Yathā akṣārthasannikarṣeṇārthāvabodhe, tadvata.

---

#### **Translation:**
> The purposes of the inquiry into dharma and Brahman differ fundamentally.
> The knowledge of dharma leads to abhyudaya (worldly prosperity) and depends on action. In contrast, the knowledge of Brahman results in niḥśreyasa (ultimate liberation) and is independent of further action.
> Dharma is a potential reality to be actualized by action, but Brahman is an eternal, already-existing reality that does not depend on human effort.
> There is also a difference in the nature of injunctions (codanā). The injunction concerning dharma guides the person to action while simultaneously imparting knowledge. However, the "injunction" about Brahman merely imparts knowledge without requiring further action.
> Just as an object becomes known by mere proximity to the senses, so does Brahman become known through inquiry.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Abhyudaya (अभ्युदय):**
   - Transliteration: Abhyudaya
   - Meaning: Worldly prosperity or material success.
   - Context: The goal of dharma, achieved through ritualistic or ethical action.

2. **Niḥśreyasa (निःश्रेयस):**
   - Transliteration: Niḥśreyasa
   - Meaning: Ultimate liberation or supreme good.
   - Context: The goal of Brahman knowledge, transcending worldly outcomes.

3. **Codanā (चोदना):**
   - Transliteration: Codanā
   - Meaning: Injunction or directive.
   - Context: Refers to scriptural commands that either prescribe action (in the case of dharma) or impart knowledge (in the case of Brahman).

4. **Bhūta (भूत):**
   - Transliteration: Bhūta
   - Meaning: Already existing.
   - Context: Refers to Brahman, which is an eternal reality not created or influenced by human action.

5. **Avabodha (अवबोध):**
   - Transliteration: Avabodha
   - Meaning: Knowledge or awareness.
   - Context: The realization of Brahman, likened to perception requiring no external effort beyond inquiry.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - The inquiries into dharma and Brahman differ in purpose and scope:
     - Dharma focuses on action and leads to worldly prosperity (abhyudaya).
     - Brahman focuses on knowledge and leads to liberation (niḥśreyasa).

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - If dharma also imparts knowledge and Brahman is already existent, why is there a need for separate inquiry into Brahman?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara distinguishes the nature of knowledge in each case:
     - Dharma requires action to actualize its fruits.
     - Brahman, being eternal and self-existent, requires only inquiry and direct realization.
   - Brahman knowledge is unique as it does not depend on action but on removing ignorance through inquiry.

4. **Injunctions in Context:**
   - Dharma's injunctions motivate both action and understanding.
   - Brahman’s injunctions, if they can be called that, only aim to reveal truth through contemplation, without requiring further effort.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - Brahman is self-existent and independent of human activity, contrasting with dharma, which is contingent upon rituals and ethics.
   - Liberation (mokṣa) arises from knowledge of Brahman alone, which dissolves ignorance without requiring additional effort.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - Similar to Kant’s distinction between practical reason (action-oriented) and pure reason (knowledge-oriented), Śaṅkara differentiates between the results of dharma and Brahman inquiry.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 3:**
The purpose of Brahmajijñāsā is distinct from other inquiries like dharmajijñāsā. While dharma leads to prosperity through action, Brahman leads to liberation through knowledge. Śaṅkara emphasizes the independence of Brahman knowledge from ritual or action, underscoring its uniqueness as the path to ultimate truth.

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> ब्रह्मणो जिज्ञासा ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा।
> ब्रह्म च वक्ष्यमाणलक्षणम् — ‘जन्माद्यस्य यतः’ इति।
> अत एव न ब्रह्मशब्दस्य जात्याद्यर्थान्तरमाशङ्कितव्यम्।
> ब्रह्मण इति कर्मणि षष्ठी, न शेषे; जिज्ञास्यापेक्षत्वाज्जिज्ञासायाः।
> ज्ञातुमिच्छा जिज्ञासा।
> अवगतिपर्यन्तं ज्ञानं सन्वाच्याया इच्छायाः कर्म, फलविषयत्वादिच्छायाः।

> ब्रह्मावगतिर्हि पुरुषार्थः, निःशेषसंसारबीजाविद्याद्यनर्थनिबर्हणात्।
> तस्माद्ब्रह्म जिज्ञासितव्यम्।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Brahmaṇo jijñāsā brahmajijñāsā.
> Brahma ca vakṣyamāṇalakṣaṇam — ‘janmādyasya yataḥ’ iti.
> Ata eva na brahmaśabdasya jātyādyarthāntaram āśaṅkitavyam.
> Brahmaṇa iti karmaṇi ṣaṣṭhī, na śeṣe; jijñāsyāpekṣatvāj jijñāsāyāḥ.
> Jñātum icchā jijñāsā.
> Avagatiparyantaṃ jñānaṃ sanvācyāyā icchāyāḥ karma, phalaviṣayatvād icchāyāḥ.
> Jñānena hi pramāṇena avagantum iṣṭaṃ brahma.
> Brahmāvagatir hi puruṣārthaḥ, niḥśeṣasaṃsārabījāvidyād yanartha-nibarhaṇāt.
> Tasmād brahma jijñāsitavyam.

---

#### **Translation:**
> The inquiry into Brahman (brahmajijñāsā) means the desire to know Brahman.
> Brahman will be defined in the next sutra as “that from which the origin, sustenance, and dissolution of the universe arise” (janmādyasya yataḥ).
> Therefore, one must not interpret the term "Brahman" as referring to a generic category (jāti) or other concepts.
> The grammatical case in “Brahmaṇa” is objective (karmaṇi ṣaṣṭhī), signifying that Brahman is the object of the inquiry.
> Jijñāsā is the desire to know, extending until complete comprehension is achieved. This knowledge has Brahman as its object and its result.
> Knowledge of Brahman is the supreme goal (puruṣārtha) because it eradicates all seeds of saṃsāra (worldly bondage) and the suffering caused by ignorance.
> Therefore, Brahman is to be inquired into.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Brahman (ब्रह्मन्):**
   - Transliteration: Brahman
   - Meaning: The ultimate reality, defined as the source, sustenance, and dissolution of the universe.
   - Context: Śaṅkara specifies that Brahman transcends categories like jāti (class) or guṇa (quality), being beyond empirical attributes.

2. **Jijñāsā (जिज्ञासा):**
   - Transliteration: Jijñāsā
   - Meaning: Desire to know.
   - Context: Indicates the focused inquiry into Brahman as the object of knowledge.

3. **Karmaṇi Ṣaṣṭhī (कर्मणि षष्ठी):**
   - Transliteration: Karmaṇi Ṣaṣṭhī
   - Meaning: Objective genitive.
   - Context: Specifies that Brahman is the object of the inquiry, not a subsidiary entity or means to another end.

4. **Puruṣārtha (पुरुषार्थ):**
   - Transliteration: Puruṣārtha
   - Meaning: The supreme goal of human life.
   - Context: Brahman knowledge is the highest puruṣārtha because it liberates one from all bondage.

5. **Janmādyasya Yataḥ (जन्माद्यस्य यतः):**
   - Transliteration: Janmādyasya Yataḥ
   - Meaning: That from which the origin, sustenance, and dissolution of the universe arise.
   - Context: This phrase, from the second sutra, encapsulates the defining characteristic of Brahman.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Brahman is the ultimate reality, defined as the origin, sustenance, and dissolution of the universe. This reality must be inquired into to eradicate ignorance and attain liberation.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - Why focus on Brahman? Could it not simply be another abstract concept or category, such as jāti (class) or guṇa (quality)?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara refutes such misconceptions, emphasizing that Brahman is neither a generic class nor an abstract quality but the supreme, self-existent reality. It transcends empirical categories and is the object of ultimate knowledge.

4. **Purpose of Inquiry:**
   - Unlike transient knowledge, which may fulfill worldly goals, the knowledge of Brahman serves the highest purpose: the eradication of saṃsāra (cycle of birth and death) by dissolving ignorance.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - Brahman is defined as the substratum of all existence, transcending all empirical attributes and dualities. This section establishes the non-dual nature of Brahman and the purpose of its inquiry.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - Similar to Kant’s notion of the "noumenon" as the ultimate reality beyond appearances, Śaṅkara’s Brahman is the unchanging reality behind the transient phenomena of the universe.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 4:**
Śaṅkara defines Brahman as the ultimate reality, emphasizing its independence from empirical categories and its role as the highest goal of knowledge. The inquiry into Brahman eradicates ignorance and leads to liberation, making it the supreme pursuit of human life.

## **Section 5: Common Misconceptions About Brahman**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> तत्पुनर्ब्रह्म प्रसिद्धमप्रसिद्धं वा स्यात्।
> यदि प्रसिद्धं न जिज्ञासितव्यम्।
> अथाप्रसिद्धं नैव शक्यं जिज्ञासितुमिति।
> उच्यते — अस्ति तावद्ब्रह्म नित्यशुद्धबुद्धमुक्तस्वभावं सर्वज्ञं सर्वशक्तिसमन्वितम्।
> ब्रह्मशब्दस्य हि व्युत्पाद्यमानस्य नित्यशुद्धत्वादयोऽर्थाः प्रतीयन्ते, बृंहतेर्धातोरर्थानुगमात्।
> सर्वस्यात्मत्वाच्च ब्रह्मास्तित्वप्रसिद्धिः।
> सर्वो ह्यात्मास्तित्वं प्रत्येति, न ‘नाहमस्मि’ इति।
> यदि हि नात्मास्तित्वप्रसिद्धिः स्यात्, सर्वो लोकः ‘नाहमस्मि’ इति प्रतीयात्।
> आत्मा च ब्रह्म।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Tatpunarbrahma prasiddhamaprasiddhaṃ vā syāt.
> Yadi prasiddhaṃ na jijñāsitavyam.
> Athāprasiddhaṃ naiva śakyaṃ jijñāsitumiti.
> Ucyate — asti tāvadbrahma nityaśuddhabuddhamuktasvabhāvaṃ sarvajñaṃ sarvaśaktisamanvitam.
> Brahmaśabdasya hi vyutpādyamānasya nityaśuddhatvādayo’rthāḥ pratīyante, bṛṃhaterdhātorarthānugamāt.
> Sarvasya ātmātvācca brahmāstitvaprasiddhiḥ.
> Sarvo hyātmāstitvaṃ pratyeti, na ‘nāhamasmi’ iti.
> Yadi hi nātmāstitvaprasiddhiḥ syāt, sarvo lokaḥ ‘nāhamasmi’ iti pratīyāt.
> Ātmā ca brahma.

---

#### **Translation:**
> Now, Brahman may be considered either well-known (prasiddha) or unknown (aprasiddha).
> If it is well-known, there is no need for inquiry. If it is unknown, how could it possibly be the object of inquiry?
> It is answered: Brahman indeed exists, possessing the nature of eternal purity, intelligence, and freedom (nitya-śuddha-buddha-mukta-svabhāva), and endowed with omniscience and omnipotence.
> The term "Brahman," when analyzed, reveals these attributes, consistent with its root *bṛṃh* ("to expand").
> Further, Brahman is the self (ātman) of all beings, and its existence is self-evident.
> Everyone perceives the existence of the self (ātman) as "I am" (nāhamasmi iti).
> If the self’s existence were not evident, people would perceive "I do not exist," which is never the case.
> And this self (ātman) is Brahman.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Prasiddha (प्रसिद्ध):**
   - Transliteration: Prasiddha
   - Meaning: Well-known or evident.
   - Context: Refers to the perception that Brahman is already recognized by everyone as the self.

2. **Aprasiddha (अप्रसिद्ध):**
   - Transliteration: Aprasiddha
   - Meaning: Unknown or not evident.
   - Context: If Brahman were completely unknown, it would not be possible to inquire into it.

3. **Nitya-Śuddha-Buddha-Mukta-Svabhāva (नित्य-शुद्ध-बुद्ध-मुक्त-स्वभाव):**
   - Transliteration: Nitya-Śuddha-Buddha-Mukta-Svabhāva
   - Meaning: Eternally pure, intelligent, and free.
   - Context: Describes the intrinsic nature of Brahman, free from impurities or limitations.

4. **Bṛṃh (बृंह):**
   - Transliteration: Bṛṃh
   - Meaning: To expand or grow.
   - Context: The root of the term "Brahman," symbolizing its vastness and infinitude.

5. **Ātman (आत्मन्):**
   - Transliteration: Ātman
   - Meaning: Self.
   - Context: Śaṅkara equates the self with Brahman, asserting that the self’s existence is self-evident.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Brahman is not completely unknown (aprasiddha) because it is self-evident as the self (ātman). Nor is it fully known (prasiddha), as its true nature remains veiled by ignorance.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - If Brahman is already evident, why is there a need for inquiry? If it is not evident, how can it be known at all?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara resolves this by explaining that while the self (ātman) is self-evident, its identity with Brahman remains obscured by ignorance. The inquiry into Brahman seeks to remove this ignorance, revealing the self’s true, non-dual nature.

4. **The Role of Ignorance:**
   - The apparent duality between self and Brahman arises from avidyā (ignorance). Inquiry aims to dissolve this illusion and establish Brahman as the self of all.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes that Brahman is both evident and hidden:
     - Evident as the self, which everyone experiences as "I am."
     - Hidden due to ignorance, which creates a false sense of duality and separateness.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - Śaṅkara’s approach resembles Kant’s notion of the noumenon (ultimate reality) being indirectly known through phenomena. Brahman is indirectly known as the self but requires inquiry to realize its true nature.

---

### **Conclusion for Section 5:**
Śaṅkara addresses misconceptions about Brahman by explaining its dual status as both evident (self-evident as the self) and hidden (its true nature obscured by ignorance). Inquiry into Brahman seeks to reconcile this apparent contradiction, leading to the realization of the self’s non-dual identity with Brahman.

---

## **Section 6: The Need for Inquiry**

---

#### **Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
> तत्राविचार्य यत्किञ्चित्प्रतिपद्यमानो निःश्रेयसात्प्रतिहन्येत, अनर्थं चेयात्।
> तस्माद्ब्रह्मजिज्ञासोपन्यासमुखेन वेदान्तवाक्यमीमांसा तदविरोधितर्कोपकरणा निःश्रेयसप्रयोजना प्रस्तूयते।

---

#### **Transliteration (IAST):**
> Tatrāvicārya yatkiñcit pratipadyamāno niḥśreyasāt pratihanyeta, anarthaṃ ceyāt.
> Tasmād brahmajijñāsopanyāsamukhena vedāntavākyamīmāṃsā tadavirodhitarkopakarṇā niḥśreyasaprayojanā prastūyate.

---

#### **Translation:**
> Without proper inquiry, any indiscriminate understanding may obstruct the attainment of liberation (niḥśreyasa) and lead to harm.
> Therefore, through the introduction of Brahmajijñāsā, the inquiry into Vedāntic statements is undertaken, supported by reasoning consistent with them, with the aim of achieving liberation.

---

### **Key Terms Analysis:**

1. **Avicāra (अविचार):**
   - Transliteration: Avicāra
   - Meaning: Lack of inquiry or critical analysis.
   - Context: Refers to the danger of unexamined assumptions leading to errors that obstruct liberation.

2. **Niḥśreyasa (निःश्रेयस):**
   - Transliteration: Niḥśreyasa
   - Meaning: Liberation or the ultimate good.
   - Context: The supreme goal of human life, attainable through the knowledge of Brahman.

3. **Vedānta-Vākyamīmāṃsā (वेदान्त-वाक्यमीमांसा):**
   - Transliteration: Vedānta-Vākyamīmāṃsā
   - Meaning: Inquiry into Vedāntic statements.
   - Context: Systematic analysis of Upaniṣadic texts to discern the truth about Brahman.

4. **Tarka (तर्क):**
   - Transliteration: Tarka
   - Meaning: Reasoning or logical argument.
   - Context: Reasoning that supports and does not contradict Vedāntic teachings.

5. **Anartha (अनर्थ):**
   - Transliteration: Anartha
   - Meaning: Harm or undesirable consequences.
   - Context: Refers to the obstacles created by ignorance or false understanding.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis:**

1. **Thesis (Siddhānta):**
   - Śaṅkara asserts that inquiry (vicāra) is essential to dispel ignorance and prevent errors that obstruct liberation.

2. **Objection (Pūrvapakṣa):**
   - Why is inquiry necessary if Brahman is already evident as the self? Can’t one simply rely on direct experience or faith in scriptures?

3. **Resolution:**
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes the importance of systematic inquiry into Vedāntic texts to uncover the true nature of Brahman. Without proper reasoning and analysis, one risks misinterpreting scriptures or clinging to false notions, both of which hinder liberation.

4. **Role of Reasoning (Tarka):**
   - Reasoning is essential but must align with Vedāntic teachings. Independent reasoning (prātantrika tarka) is rejected, as it may lead to speculative errors. Instead, reasoning must be a tool to clarify and support scriptural truths.

---

### **Philosophical Integration:**

1. **Advaita Vedānta Perspective:**
   - Inquiry is the process of removing ignorance through the study of Vedānta, contemplation, and reasoning. Śaṅkara underscores that liberation is not achieved by blind faith but by direct realization through systematic analysis.

2. **Transcendental Idealism Parallel:**
   - Śaṅkara’s approach aligns with the Kantian method of critical inquiry. Just as Kant demands rigorous examination to move beyond appearances, Śaṅkara insists on disciplined inquiry to uncover the non-dual reality of Brahman.

### **Practical Implications:**

1. **Avoiding Anartha (Harm):**
   - Without proper inquiry, one may misinterpret Brahman or cling to dualistic views, perpetuating saṃsāra (bondage).

2. **Path to Liberation:**
   - Inquiry leads to clarity, dissolving ignorance and enabling one to experience Brahman as the self, culminating in liberation.

### **Conclusion for Section 6:**
Śaṅkara emphasizes the indispensability of inquiry into Brahman. It is not enough to accept Brahman as an abstract concept or rely on blind faith; systematic inquiry into Vedāntic texts, supported by sound reasoning, is essential for realizing the self’s true, non-dual nature. This inquiry safeguards against misconceptions and guides the seeker toward liberation.
