Below is the analysis of **Bhagavad Gītā 2.56**, continuing the integrative methodology. We will use the **Being / Essence / Concept** dialectical structure, highlight key terms from the verse and commentary, and maintain the cross-tradition synthesis. With Arjuna’s question in verse 54 prompting a “technical description” of the sthita-prajña’s attributes, verse 56 provides more details on the inner qualities of such a realized person. This verse builds on previous groundwork of mental steadiness, further preparing the conceptual ground for internal Yogic disciplines like prāṇāyāma and pratyāhāra.

### I. Mūla Verse

**Sanskrit**
```markdown
दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः ।

### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya (Reconstructed/Referenced)

While you have not provided the Bhāṣya text for verse 56 in your prompt, it is well-known. Śaṅkara comments that the sthita-prajña is unmoved by sorrow and not elated by pleasure, having overcome impulses like attachment (rāga), fear (bhaya), and anger (krodha). The commentary typically emphasizes that this mental equilibrium arises from established knowledge of the Self and is maintained through vigilant wisdom. Such a person is called a “muni,” one who is silent in the sense of being inwardly absorbed and free from mental turbulence.

**Key Points from Śaṅkara’s Likely Commentary**:
- **अनुद्विग्नमनाः (anudvigna-manāḥ)**: The mind does not become agitated by sorrow.
- **विगतस्पृहः (vigata-spṛhaḥ)**: Completely free from hankering after pleasures.
- **वीतरागभयक्रोधः (vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ)**: One who has gone beyond attachment, fear, and anger.
- This mental state emerges from clear, stable knowledge (sthita-prajñā), not from forced suppression. The sage is naturally free, not straining to avoid emotional turbulence.

### III. Term Analysis

**Key Terms from Mūla Verse**:

- **अनुद्विग्नमनाः (anudvigna-manāḥ)**: A mind free from agitation even in difficulties
  *Contextual Significance*: This equanimity in suffering mirrors the stability achieved in a perfected āsana, where external discomfort does not unsettle the practitioner. Similarly, just as one maintains a steady seat (āsana) regardless of bodily challenges, here the mind remains steady despite emotional challenges.

- **विगतस्पृहः (vigata-spṛhaḥ)**: Free from longing in pleasures
  *Contextual Significance*: This is akin to the mental restraint required before prāṇāyāma. Just as prāṇāyāma requires calmness and an absence of restless desire for pleasurable sensations, mental freedom from longing sets the groundwork for controlling subtler bodily energies.

- **वीतरागभयक्रोध (vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodha)**: Beyond attachment, fear, and anger
  *Contextual Significance*: These three are primary drivers of mental restlessness. Overcoming them paves the way for advanced internal practices like pratyāhāra, where the mind can easily withdraw from sensory engagements because it is no longer controlled by these impulses.

**Sthita-Dhīḥ (Steady Intellect) and Muni (Sage)**:
- A “muni” is often described as a “silent sage,” not necessarily in vocal silence, but inward silence. Such inward silence is critical for the refined inward focus of prāṇāyāma and pratyāhāra. If the mind is noisy with attachment, fear, and anger, controlling the breath and senses is difficult. The silence of a muni’s mind suggests readiness for subtle, inner techniques.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: In ordinary life, sorrow triggers agitation and pleasure prompts craving. Fear and anger continuously drive mental fluctuations. The practitioner’s baseline is a mind buffeted by these emotional winds.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: Through insight (prajñā) and consistent practice, the mind learns not to react. Freed from emotional upheaval, the practitioner attains a deeper internal balance. This is like stabilizing an inner posture. Just as physical āsana stabilizes the body, this emotional equilibrium stabilizes the psyche.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: The final conceptual insight is that mastering emotional equilibrium is not just ethical or psychological: it’s also a technical requirement for advanced Yoga. When fear, anger, and attachment no longer disturb the mind, controlling breath (prāṇāyāma) and withdrawing the senses (pratyāhāra) become feasible. The verse describes a mind so balanced it naturally supports internal Yogic processes. The “sage of steady intellect” has achieved a mental condition parallel to a perfect internal “āsana” of the mind, suitable for subtle inner work.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Systematic Refinement**: Progressing from intellectual inquiry (verse 54’s question) and the letting go of desires (verse 55), we now see emotional equilibrium in verse 56. This systematic refinement aligns with a stepwise approach: after stabilizing wisdom and reducing desires, one now stabilizes the emotional field.

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: In a non-dual framework, emotions like attachment, fear, and anger arise from perceiving dualities and threats. Overcoming them is a step closer to the non-dual Self, clearing the mind for subtle meditative absorption.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: Buddhism also emphasizes freeing the mind from rāga (attachment), dosa (anger), and moha (delusion) to achieve calm abiding (samatha). Similarly, in Yoga, calming these afflictive states is prerequisite to deeper concentration. Freed from these emotional defilements, the practitioner can begin the inner technical practices of controlling the breath and senses.

- **Readiness for Pratyāhāra**: Pratyāhāra involves retracting the senses inward, akin to a tortoise withdrawing its limbs (as described in Gītā 2.58). Such withdrawal is effortless when the mind isn’t drawn out by attachment or repelled by fear and anger. The emotional neutrality described here sets the stage for that inward turn.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: Emotional neutrality arises from the recognition that sorrow and pleasure are transient phenomena in the non-dual Brahman. With this understanding, the mind stops reacting, becoming stable. In this non-dual backdrop, prāṇāyāma and pratyāhāra are natural steps of internal exploration, not forced techniques.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: In Abhidharma, overcoming the kilesas (defilements like greed, hatred, and delusion) leads to a calm and lucid mind. This parallels the state described here, enabling deeper meditative insight and stable concentration that characterizes advanced yoga practice.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 56 presents the sage’s emotional profile: neither shaken by sorrow nor seduced by pleasure, and free from attachment, fear, and anger. This emotional equilibrium is the psychological equivalent of a stable support structure, allowing deeper inward techniques to function optimally.

- **Foundation for Internal Disciplinary Practices**: By achieving emotional stability, the practitioner sets a crucial foundation. Just as a stable building foundation supports higher floors, a stable emotional field supports subtle inward practices — from breath regulation (prāṇāyāma) to sense withdrawal (pratyāhāra), culminating in meditative absorption (samādhi).

# Next Steps

- **Looking Forward**: With verse 58 on the horizon, we anticipate the explicit mention of “samharate,” which illustrates sense withdrawal. The current verse’s focus on emotional calmness ensures that by the time we reach that topic, we understand the mental prerequisites for pratyāhāra.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Each verse refines the image of a sthita-prajña. By internalizing these principles, the aspirant not only emulates the sage’s state but also prepares for advanced Yogic practices, alluded to throughout the text.

By analyzing Verse 2.56, we see how the Bhagavad Gītā continues to delineate the internal qualities of sthita-prajñā. Emotional equanimity emerges as a technical and psychological necessity, paving the way for subtle inner disciplines like prāṇāyāma and pratyāhāra, which the Gītā will evoke metaphorically in upcoming verses.
