Below is the analysis of **Bhagavad Gītā 2.67**, maintaining the integrative approach with the **Being / Essence / Concept** framework and referencing Śaṅkara’s commentary. This verse further explains why one who is not integrated (ayukta) lacks discernment (buddhi). The senses, wandering among their objects, draw the mind outward, just as a gust of wind diverts a boat from its course. This imagery reinforces the need for internal control (dhāraṇā) and stable self-awareness (prajñā) to maintain the path toward realization.

# Technical Analysis Artifact: Bhagavad Gītā 2.67

### I. Mūla Verse

**Sanskrit**
```markdown
इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते ।
तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि ॥ ६७ ॥
```

**Transliteration**
```markdown
indriyāṇāṃ hi caratāṃ yan mano ’nuvidhīyate |
tad asya harati prajñāṃ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi || 67 ||
```

**Translation**
"Indeed, when the mind follows the roaming senses, it carries away one’s discernment, as the wind carries away a boat on the waters."

### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

**Key Sanskrit Excerpts**
```markdown
इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां ... मनः अनुविधीयते ... तदस्य ... हरति प्रज्ञां ...
वायुः नावमिव ... मनो विषयविषयां करोति।
```

**Key Points from the Bhāṣya**:
- The senses roam freely toward their objects (viṣayā).
- When the mind (manas) follows these wandering senses (ananuvidhīyate), it loses its orientation and discernment (prajñā).
- Śaṅkara uses the analogy of the wind blowing a boat off course. Similarly, the mind, if dragged by senses, deviates from the path of Self-knowledge (ātma-jñāna).
- This underscores that stable wisdom (prajñā) requires not just intelligence but control over where the mind is directed.

### III. Term Analysis

**Key Terms from Mūla Verse**:

- **इन्द्रियाणां चरतां (indriyāṇāṃ caratāṃ)**: Senses wandering among their objects
  *Contextual Significance*: Without disciplined direction, the senses naturally move outward. Pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā prevent this outward drift, ensuring the mind does not become hostage to sensory stimuli.

- **मनः अनुविधीयते (manaḥ anuvidhīyate)**: The mind follows along
  *Contextual Significance*: The mind is meant to be sovereign, yet if it passively chases sensory impressions, it loses autonomy. Dhāraṇā aims to ensure the mind does not just react but remains centered on a chosen point of focus.

- **हरति प्रज्ञां (harati prajñāṃ)**: Carries away discernment
  *Contextual Significance*: Without a stable inner center, discernment (the capacity to distinguish Self from non-Self, right from wrong) is lost. Yogic practice stabilizes the mind so it can maintain prajñā even amid sensory inputs.

- **वायुः नावमिव अम्भसि (vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi)**: Like the wind a boat on water
  *Contextual Significance*: This vivid analogy shows the mind as a vessel meant to travel towards liberation. If the senses (wind) are uncontrolled, they push the mind (boat) off the intended spiritual course.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: The seeker may initially hope to cultivate wisdom but allows the senses to wander freely.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: Recognizing that when the mind follows the senses, discernment is lost. Without stable inward attention (dhāraṇā), the mind is at the mercy of external impulses.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: The essence is that controlling the mind’s direction is crucial. If left following sensory whims, prajñā vanishes. Conversely, if the mind is anchored inward (through pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā), discernment stays intact, enabling progress towards dhyāna, samādhi, and realization.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Rational-Experiential Synthesis**: Rational understanding alone cannot prevent the mind from drifting if it chases external objects. Practical experience—training the mind through dhāraṇā—is required to keep discernment alive.

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: Non-dual insight requires the mind not to be scattered by multiplicity. If senses dictate attention, non-dual realization is thwarted. Stable focus prevents the wind of sensory distractions from blowing the mind off-course.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: In Buddhism, a mind chasing sense objects cannot sustain mindfulness or concentration. Similarly, Yoga insists that pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā are prerequisites to steady insight. Both traditions warn that following sensory impulses derails meditative stability and understanding.

- **Dharana’s Central Role**: Dhāraṇā fixes the mind on a single focal point, preventing it from following senses. Without dhāraṇā, the mind’s attention scatters, losing discernment. This verse strongly supports the necessity of dhāraṇā for maintaining spiritual direction.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: For discernment of the Self, the mind must not run after external objects. If the mind follows the senses, it identifies with externalities, obscuring the non-dual Self. Dhāraṇā ensures the mind remains aligned with the Self rather than external phenomena.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: Without concentration and right effort, the mind succumbs to proliferations (papañca), losing clarity. Stable concentration is key to preserving discernment, similar to how the Gītā’s “prajñā” must be guarded against external turbulence.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.67 reinforces the message: without mastery over where the mind places its attention, discernment (prajñā) evaporates. Yogic methods (pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā) are thus indispensable. The verse’s analogy of the wind and boat underscores the importance of steering the mind intentionally toward Self-knowledge.

- **Gateway to Higher Practice**: Maintaining prajñā against sensory distractions is a stepping stone to deeper meditative states. By not succumbing to the wind of senses, the practitioner sets the stage for dhyāna and samādhi, where discernment is perfected.

# Next Steps

- **Looking Forward**: Subsequent verses may balance these cautions with positive strategies to maintain control and insight. We’ll see how the text encourages stable Yogic practice as the antidote.

- **Refining the Path**: This verse adds a crucial layer: the mind must not just be free of attachment and aversion, but must actively not follow the senses’ wanderings. Dhāraṇā and related disciplines provide the practical skill set to achieve this.

---

By analyzing Verse 2.67, we see that the mind’s submission to wandering senses leads to the loss of discernment, just as a strong wind drives a boat off its path. This vividly underscores the necessity of internal disciplines like dhāraṇā to keep the mind centered, preserving prajñā and guiding the practitioner steadily toward higher realization.
