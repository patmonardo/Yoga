## III. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit
भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां भोगः कर्तव्यः ऐश्वर्यं च इति भोगैश्वर्ययोरेव प्रणयवतां तदात्मभूतानाम् । तया क्रियाविशेषबहुलया वाचा अपहृतचेतसाम् आच्छादितविवेकप्रज्ञानां व्यवसायात्मिका साङ्‍ख्ये योगे वा बुद्धिः समाधौ समाधीयते अस्मिन् पुरुषोपभोगाय सर्वमिति समाधिः अन्तःकरणं बुद्धिः तस्मिन् समाधौ, न विधीयते न भवति इत्यर्थः ॥ ४४ ॥

### Transliteration
bhogaiśvaryaprasaktānāṃ bhogaḥ kartavyaḥ aiśvaryaṃ ca iti bhogaiśvaryayoreva praṇayavatāṃ tadātmabhūtānām | tayā kriyāviśeṣabahulayā vācā apahṛtacetasām ācchāditavivekaprajñānāṃ vyavasāyātmikā sāṅkhye yoge vā buddhiḥ samādhau samadhīyate asmin puruṣopabhogāya sarvamiti samādhiḥ antaḥkaraṇaṃ buddhiḥ tasmin samādhau, na vidhīyate na bhavati ityarthaḥ || 44 ||

### Translation
"Those attached to pleasure and power" means those who have affection only for pleasure and power, thinking "pleasure and power must be obtained," who have become identified with that. Those "whose minds are carried away" by that speech full of various rituals, whose discriminative wisdom is covered - for them the understanding whose nature is determination, whether in Sāṅkhya or Yoga, does not arise in samādhi - samādhi means that in which everything is held together for the enjoyment of puruṣa, the inner instrument, the intellect - in that samādhi, it does not occur, this is the meaning.

# BG 2.44 Trans-Idealist Analysis

## I. The Architecture of Loss

### A. External Movement
The verse presents a precise architecture of consciousness's movement away from its ground:
1. From व्यवसाय to प्रसक्ति
   - Loss of determination
   - Into external attachment
   - Through desire's power

2. From समाधि to विक्षेप
   - Unity fractures
   - Into multiplicity
   - Through power's allure

### B. Dialectic of Desire
Not mere warning but systematic revelation:
1. Consciousness Structure
   - भोग: pleasure principle
   - ऐश्वर्य: power principle
   - Their unity in attachment

2. Self-Perpetuating System
   - Desire creates objects
   - Objects intensify desire
   - Blocking समाधि access

## II. The Impossible Unity

What makes समाधि impossible isn't moral but structural:

### A. Double Bind
1. External Fixation
   - Can't find center externally
   - Yet can't stop seeking it
   - Self-defeating movement

2. Internal Dissolution
   - विवेक covered precisely when needed
   - प्रज्ञा lost in its search
   - बुद्धि scattered in unifying

### B. Buddhist Integration
Resonance with Mādhyamika insights:
1. स्वभाव Problem
   - External inherent nature sought
   - Yet impossible to find
   - Leading to suffering

2. शून्यता Solution
   - Beyond external/internal split
   - Through middle way
   - To original unity

## III. Freedom's Structure

### A. Via Negativa
The text reveals liberation's path through its opposite:
1. What Blocks Unity
   - External attachment
   - Power seeking
   - Pleasure fixation

2. What Opens It
   - Internal freeing
   - Power renunciation
   - Pleasure transcendence

### B. Pure Reason's Role
Not mere conceptual understanding but:
1. Original Synthesis
   - Prior to pleasure/power split
   - Ground of determination
   - Source of unity

2. Practical Implementation
   - Through viveka restoration
   - In present awareness
   - As living reality

## IV. Contemporary Relevance

### A. Modern Consciousness
The verse precisely diagnoses our condition:
1. Technology Age
   - Endless pleasure access
   - Unlimited power dreams
   - Yet unity impossible

2. Information Era
   - Knowledge without wisdom
   - Data without discrimination
   - Power without peace

### B. Liberation Path
Shows way through modern crisis:
1. Not By Addition
   - More pleasure fails
   - More power blocks
   - More info scatters

2. But Through Recognition
   - Of unity's ground
   - In present awareness
   - Beyond seeking's trap
