## **II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya Analysis**

### **Contextual Introduction**

After explaining the distinction between the real (*sat*) and the unreal (*asat*), Śaṅkara anticipates a question: **"What, then, is that which is always real?"** To answer this, he presents verse 2.17, which elaborates on the nature of the indestructible reality—the Self or Brahman.

### **Translation of the Bhāṣya**

1. **अविनाशि न विनष्टुं शीलं यस्य इति ।**

   "अविनाशि (avināśi): that whose nature is not to be destroyed."

2. **तुशब्दः असतो विशेषणार्थः ।**

   "The particle 'tu' (but) is used to distinguish it from the unreal."

3. **तत् विद्धि विजानीहि ।**

   "Know that."

4. **किम्? येन सर्वम् इदं जगत् ततं व्याप्तं सदाख्येन ब्रह्मणा साकाशम्, आकाशेनेव घटादयः ।**

   "What is that? By which all this world is pervaded—the Brahman called 'Sat' (Being), along with space, just as pots and the like are pervaded by space."

5. **विनाशम् अदर्शनम् अभावम् ।**

   "Destruction (*vināśa*) means disappearance or non-existence."

6. **अव्ययस्य न व्येति उपचय-अपचयौ न याति इति अव्ययम् तस्य अव्ययस्य ।**

   "Of the immutable (*avyaya*), that which does not decay—does not undergo increase or decrease—is called 'immutable'; of that immutable."

7. **नैतत् सदाख्यं ब्रह्म स्वेन रूपेण व्येति व्यभिचरति, निरवयवत्वात्, देहादिवत् ।**

   "This Brahman, called 'Sat', does not decay or change in its own nature because it is without parts, unlike the body and so on."

8. **न अपि आत्मीयेन, आत्मीय-अभावात् ।**

   "Nor does it decay through its possessions, because it has no possessions."

9. **यथा देवदत्तो धनहान्या व्येति, न तु एवं ब्रह्म व्येति ।**

   "Just as Devadatta decays through loss of wealth, but Brahman does not decay in this way."

10. **अतः अव्ययस्य अस्य ब्रह्मणः विनाशं न कश्चित् कर्तुम् अर्हति, न कश्चित् आत्मानं विनाशयितुं शक्नोति ईश्वरः अपि ।**

    "Therefore, no one can bring about the destruction of this immutable Brahman; no one, not even God (Īśvara), can destroy the Self."

11. **आत्मा हि ब्रह्म, स्वात्मनि च क्रिया-विरोधात् ।**

    "For the Self is indeed Brahman, and action upon one's own Self is a contradiction."

### **Dialectical Analysis**

#### **1. Nature of the Indestructible**

- **Definition of 'Avināśi'**: That which cannot be destroyed.
- **Emphasis on 'Tu'**: The particle 'but' distinguishes the indestructible reality from the destructible unreal entities discussed earlier.

#### **2. Brahman as All-Pervading**

- **Pervasion of the Universe**: Brahman pervades all existence, including space itself, similar to how space pervades objects like pots.
- **Implication**: The omnipresence of Brahman implies its fundamental reality and existence in all things.

#### **3. Immutability of Brahman**

- **Meaning of 'Avyaya'**: Brahman does not undergo any change, increase, or decrease.
- **Reason for Immutability**:
  - **Partlessness**: Brahman is without parts, unlike the body or material objects, which can decay.
  - **Absence of Possessions**: Brahman has no attributes or possessions that can be lost.

#### **4. Inability to Destroy the Self**

- **No One Can Destroy Brahman**: Since Brahman is immutable and indestructible, no being can cause its destruction.
- **Even God Cannot Destroy the Self**: As action upon one's own Self is contradictory, even Īśvara (God) cannot destroy the Self.
- **Self as Brahman**: The individual Self is identical with Brahman; thus, the destruction of the Self is impossible.

#### **5. Logical Conclusion**

- **Contradiction in Self-Destruction**: One cannot perform an action that results in the annihilation of one's own essential nature.
- **Eternality of the Self**: The Self, being Brahman, is eternal and beyond any form of destruction.

## **III. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Non-Duality**: The Self (Ātman) and Brahman are one and the same; there is no duality between the individual and the ultimate reality.
- **Illusory Nature of Phenomena**: The transient world is unreal (asat) and subject to change, while Brahman is the only real (sat).
- **Immutability of Brahman**: Brahman is eternal, unchanging, and unaffected by any modifications.

### **2. Nature of Brahman**

- **All-Pervading**: Brahman pervades everything in existence, including space and all objects within it.
- **Partless and Formless**: Brahman is without parts (niravayava) and therefore cannot undergo decay or destruction.
- **Actionless**: Brahman does not engage in actions and cannot be the object of action.

### **3. Indestructibility of the Self**

- **Self as Eternal**: The Self cannot be destroyed because it is identical with Brahman.
- **Logical Impossibility of Self-Destruction**: Since the Self is the essence of existence, it cannot act upon itself to cause its own non-existence.

---

## **IV. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Realization of the True Self**

- **Self-Knowledge**: Strive to understand and realize that one's true nature is the indestructible Brahman.
- **Meditation and Contemplation**: Engage in practices that help in discerning the eternal Self from the transient body and mind.

### **2. Overcoming Fear of Death**

- **Understanding Immortality**: Recognize that the Self is beyond birth and death, alleviating the fear associated with mortality.
- **Detachment from the Body**: Develop non-attachment to the physical body, knowing that it is not the true Self.

### **3. Cultivating Equanimity**

- **Enduring Dualities**: With the knowledge of the Self's immutability, maintain equanimity amidst life's changes and challenges.
- **Freedom from Grief**: Let go of sorrow and delusion that arise from identifying with the impermanent.

### **4. Aligning with the Universal**

- **Seeing Unity in Diversity**: Recognize that Brahman pervades all, leading to a sense of oneness with all beings.
- **Ethical Living**: Act with the understanding that harming others is ultimately harming oneself.

## **V. Summary**

In verse 2.17, Lord Krishna explains the nature of the indestructible reality—Brahman or the Self—which pervades the entire universe. Śaṅkara's commentary elucidates that this Self is immutable, partless, and devoid of possessions, making it incapable of undergoing destruction or change. Since Brahman is the very essence of existence and identical with the Self, it cannot be destroyed by anyone, not even by Īśvara (God). The logical impossibility of self-destruction reinforces the eternal and unchanging nature of the Self.

Understanding this truth empowers spiritual seekers to transcend fear, grief, and delusion by realizing their true nature as the immortal Self. It encourages the cultivation of equanimity, detachment from the transient, and a deep sense of unity with all existence.
