## III. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit
योगस्थः सन् कुरु कर्माणि केवलमीश्वरार्थम् ; तत्रापि 'ईश्वरो मे तुष्यतु' इति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय । फलतृष्णाशून्येन क्रियमाणे कर्मणि सत्त्वशुद्धिजा ज्ञानप्राप्तिलक्षणा सिद्धिः, तद्विपर्ययजा असिद्धिः, तयोः सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः अपि समः तुल्यः भूत्वा कुरु कर्माणि । कोऽसौ योगः यत्रस्थः कुरु इति उक्तम् ? इदमेव तत् — सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समत्वं योगः उच्यते ॥ ४८ ॥

### Transliteration
yogasthaḥ san kuru karmāṇi kevalamīśvarārtham; tatrāpi 'īśvaro me tuṣyatu' iti saṅgaṃ tyaktvā dhanañjaya | phalatṛṣṇāśūnyena kriyamāṇe karmaṇi sattvaśuddhijā jñānaprāptilakṣaṇā siddhiḥ, tadviparyayajā asiddhiḥ, tayoḥ siddhyasiddhyoḥ api samaḥ tulyaḥ bhūtvā kuru karmāṇi | ko'sau yogaḥ yatrasthaḥ kuru iti uktam? idameva tat — siddhyasiddhyoḥ samatvaṃ yogaḥ ucyate || 48 ||

### Translation
Being established in yoga, perform actions solely for the Lord; even there abandoning attachment to "may the Lord be pleased with me," O Dhanañjaya. When action is performed devoid of craving for results, success is characterized by the attainment of knowledge born of purity of being, failure is born from its opposite - becoming equal, balanced in both success and failure, perform actions. What is that yoga in which being established one should act, as stated? This indeed is that - equanimity in success and failure is called yoga.
