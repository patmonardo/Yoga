### Sanskrit
न इह मोक्षमार्गे कर्मयोगे अभिक्रमनाशः अभिक्रमणमभिक्रमः प्रारम्भः तस्य नाशः नास्ति यथा कृष्यादेः । योगविषये प्रारम्भस्य न अनैकान्तिकफलत्वमित्यर्थः । किञ्च — नापि चिकित्सावत् प्रत्यवायः विद्यते भवति । किं तु स्वल्पमपि अस्य धर्मस्य योगधर्मस्य अनुष्ठितं त्रायते रक्षति महतः भयात् संसारभयात् जन्ममरणादिलक्षणात् ॥ ४० ॥

### Transliteration
na iha mokṣamārge karmayoge abhikramanāśaḥ abhikramaṇamabhikramaḥ prārambhaḥ tasya nāśaḥ nāsti yathā kṛṣyādeḥ | yogaviṣaye prārambhasya na anaikāntikaphalatvamartha | kiñca — nāpi cikitsāvat pratyavāyaḥ vidyate bhavati | kiṃ tu svalpamapi asya dharmasya yogadharmasya anuṣṭhitaṃ trāyate rakṣati mahataḥ bhayāt saṃsārabhayāt janmamaraṇādilakṣaṇāt || 40 ||

### Translation
In this path of liberation through karma-yoga, there is no loss of beginning effort - 'abhikramaṇa' means 'abhikrama' which means beginning, and there is no loss of that, unlike in agriculture etc. The meaning is that in the subject of yoga, the beginning does not have uncertain results. Moreover - there is no adverse effect, as there is in medical treatment. Rather, even a little of this dharma, this yoga-dharma, when practiced, protects, saves from great fear - the fear of saṃsāra characterized by birth, death, etc.
