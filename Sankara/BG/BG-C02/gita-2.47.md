कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।

### Transliteration
karmaṇyevādhikāraste mā phaleṣu kadācana |
mā karmaphalaheturbhūrmā te saṅgo'stvakarmaṇi || 47 ||

### Translation
Your right is to action alone, never to its fruits at any time. Do not be the cause of the fruits of action; let not your attachment be to inaction.

## III. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit
कर्मण्येव अधिकारः न ज्ञाननिष्ठायां ते तव । तत्र च कर्म कुर्वतः मा फलेषु अधिकारः अस्तु, कर्मफलतृष्णा मा भूत् कदाचन कस्याञ्चिदप्यवस्थायामित्यर्थः । यदा कर्मफले तृष्णा ते स्यात् तदा कर्मफलप्राप्तेः हेतुः स्याः, एवं मा कर्मफलहेतुः भूः । यदा हि कर्मफलतृष्णाप्रयुक्तः कर्मणि प्रवर्तते तदा कर्मफलस्यैव जन्मनो हेतुर्भवेत् । यदि कर्मफलं नेष्यते, किं कर्मणा दुःखरूपेण ? इति मा ते तव सङ्गः अस्तु अकर्मणि अकरणे प्रीतिर्मा भूत् ॥ ४७ ॥

### Transliteration
karmaṇyeva adhikāraḥ na jñānaniṣṭhāyāṃ te tava | tatra ca karma kurvataḥ mā phaleṣu adhikāraḥ astu, karmaphalatṛṣṇā mā bhūt kadācana kasyāñcidapyavasthāyamityarthaḥ | yadā karmaphale tṛṣṇā te syāt tadā karmaphalaprāpteḥ hetuḥ syāḥ, evaṃ mā karmaphalahetuḥ bhūḥ | yadā hi karmaphalatṛṣṇāprayuktaḥ karmaṇi pravartate tadā karmaphalasyaiva janmano heturbhavet | yadi karmaphalaṃ neṣyate, kiṃ karmaṇā duḥkharūpeṇa? iti mā te tava saṅgaḥ astu akarmaṇi akaraṇe prītirmā bhūt || 47 ||

### Translation
Your right is to action alone, not to steadfastness in knowledge. And while performing action, let there not be a right to the fruits, let there not be craving for the fruits of action at any time or in any state - this is the meaning. When you have craving for the fruit of action, then you would become the cause of obtaining the fruit of action; thus do not become the cause of the fruit of action. For when one acts impelled by craving for the fruit of action, then one becomes the cause of birth which is itself the fruit of action. If the fruit of action is not desired, why engage in action which is of the nature of suffering? Thus let there not be your attachment to inaction, let there not be love for non-performance.
