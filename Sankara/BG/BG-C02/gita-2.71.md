### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

**Key Sanskrit Excerpt (Provided Text)**
```markdown
विहाय परित्यज्य कामान् यः ... सर्वान् ... चरति ...
निःस्पृहः ... निर्ममः ... निरहङ्कारः ...
शान्तिं सर्वसंसारदुःखोपरमलक्षणां निर्वाणाख्याम् अधिगच्छति ...
ब्रह्मभूतो भवति इत्यर्थः
```

**Key Points from the Bhāṣya**:
- The verse describes an individual who has completely renounced all desires (kāmān), living simply with only the bare necessities (described as "जीवनमात्रचेष्टाशेषः", i.e., acting only for sustaining life).
- **Nisspṛhaḥ**: Free from even the slightest longing, not craving pleasure or comfort.
- **Nirmamaḥ**: Free from possessiveness, not identifying things as “mine,” even regarding the body and basic life-sustaining means.
- **Nirahaṅkāraḥ**: Free from egoistic self-identification, not taking pride in learning, status, or any personal attribute.
- Such a being, having risen above desire, attachment, and ego, realizes Brahman. Śaṅkara equates achieving this peace (śānti) with attaining nirvāṇa (the cessation of worldly suffering) and becoming brahmabhūtaḥ (one who abides in Brahman).

### III. Term Analysis

- **विहाय कामान् (vihāya kāmān)**:
  *Meaning*: Having completely abandoned desires.
  *Contextual Significance*: This renunciation is total—no subtle desires remain, reflecting a culmination of detachment fostered by prior Yogic discipline (pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā) and insight.

- **निःस्पृहः (niḥspṛhaḥ)**:
  *Meaning*: Without the slightest longing or craving.
  *Contextual Significance*: The sage is not just free from gross desires but also from subtle yearnings, maintaining an evenness of mind at all times.

- **निर्ममः (nirmamaḥ)**:
  *Meaning*: Without the sense of “mine.”
  *Contextual Significance*: Freed from possessiveness, the person no longer clings to body, mind, or external objects. This absence of “mine” dismantles the psychological ownership that fuels suffering.

- **निरहङ्कारः (nirahaṅkāraḥ)**:
  *Meaning*: Without ego or the notion of an “I” linked to attributes.
  *Contextual Significance*: Ego eradication removes the final barrier to seeing oneself as Brahman. Without identifying with learned qualities or social status, one’s identity shifts from individual personality to universal Self.

- **शान्तिं ... निर्वाणाख्याम् (śāntiṃ ... nirvāṇākhyām)**:
  *Meaning*: Peace, synonymous with nirvāṇa.
  *Contextual Significance*: This peace is not mere absence of conflict but the complete cessation of saṃsāra’s sufferings. It denotes liberation (mokṣa), the realization of Brahman, where no trace of ignorance remains.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: Ordinarily, a person identifies with desires, possessions, and ego. Their actions are driven by cravings and attachments, making stable peace impossible.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: By systematically removing desires (kāmāḥ), relinquishing possessiveness (mama) and ego (ahaṅkāra), the seeker strips away layers of conditioning. This leads to a state of inner freedom (niḥspṛhaḥ), where no external factor disturbs the mind.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: The final concept is that true and lasting peace (śānti), identified with nirvāṇa, arises naturally from the absence of desires, attachments, and ego. This is not a forced state but a natural outcome of understanding and realizing the Self as Brahman. The sage abides in that non-dual reality, where suffering ceases entirely.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **From External Dependence to Internal Freedom**: Rational comprehension shows that desires and ego-supporting identifications create bondage. Realizing this, the aspirant, through disciplined practice and insight, relinquishes these externalities. This shift from dependence on external validations to intrinsic fullness reflects a transcendental turn away from the phenomenal towards pure subjectivity (the Self).

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: Non-duality implies no separation between Self and reality. Desires and ego arise from perceived dualities and inadequacies. Letting go of them stabilizes one in the Self, ending all dualistic striving and achieving liberation.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: Buddhism teaches that removing craving leads to the end of suffering (nirodha). Similarly, this verse states that eliminating desires, ego, and possessiveness results in śānti/nirvāṇa. Yoga’s inner disciplines (dhāraṇā leading to dhyāna) ensure the mind can sustain this state of no-craving. Both traditions emphasize direct insight and internal freedom.

- **Foundation in Concentration and Insight**: Achieving the state described requires mental stability built on dhāraṇā. With concentration, the mind ceases to oscillate toward external stimuli. Freed from desires, the practitioner can enter deeper meditative absorption (dhyāna) and samādhi, culminating in Self-realization and total peace.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: Desires, ego, and possessiveness veil one’s true Self. Their abandonment reveals Brahman as one’s own nature. This recognition erases the conditions for suffering. The verse aligns perfectly with Advaita’s core teaching: realization of Brahman ends the cycle of seeking and suffering.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: In Abhidharma, eradicating the root causes (kilesas) of suffering leads to liberation. Here, the “kilesas” correspond to desires, I-sense, and ownership, whose removal yields a peaceful state analogous to nirvāṇa.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.71 is a culminating point showing that liberation is not gained by fulfilling desires but by transcending them. Once the mind no longer craves or identifies, it attains perfect peace. This synergy of Yogic discipline, Vedāntic insight, and renunciation of ego-driven action frames a holistic path to mokṣa.

- **Practical Implication for Liberation**: The sage described here acts only to maintain life’s necessities without personal involvement. This natural simplicity, free of self-interest, grants ultimate freedom from worldly entanglement.

# Conclusion

Bhagavad Gītā 2.71 presents the final key: giving up all desires and the ego-driven sense of ownership, one attains perfect peace (śānti) and liberation (nirvāṇa). Śaṅkara’s commentary reinforces that without cravings and ego, the realized soul stands in Brahman, free from all sorrow. This verse neatly encapsulates the spiritual summit where the earlier disciplines, sense-withdrawal, and concentration coalesce into stable Self-knowledge and unshakable serenity.
