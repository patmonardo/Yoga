## **II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya Analysis**

### **Contextual Introduction**

After explaining the nature of the real (*sat*) and the unreal (*asat*) in the previous verses, Śaṅkara anticipates a question:

**"What then is that unreal which departs from its own essential existence?"**

To answer this, he introduces Verse 2.18, which elaborates on the impermanent nature of the body and the eternal nature of the Self.

### **Segmented Translation and Analysis of the Bhāṣya**

---

## **VII. Summary**

In Verse 2.18, Lord Krishna imparts a crucial teaching about the impermanent nature of the body and the eternal nature of the Self. Śaṅkara's commentary elucidates that while the bodies are perishable and subject to change, the Self is indestructible, immeasurable, and immutable. Recognizing this distinction empowers one to act without attachment or fear, fulfilling one's duties with wisdom and equanimity.

By understanding that the Self cannot be destroyed and is beyond all physical limitations, a spiritual seeker can transcend grief, delusion, and the fear of death. This knowledge serves as a foundation for ethical living, inner peace, and ultimate liberation.

anāśino 'prameyasya tasmād yudhyasva bhārata || 2.18 ||**

### **Translation**

**"These bodies of the embodied Self are said to have an end; the Self is eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable; therefore, O Bhārata (Arjuna), fight."**

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this verse, Lord Krishna continues to instruct Arjuna on the nature of the Self and the impermanent body. After establishing the distinction between the real (*sat*) and the unreal (*asat*), Śaṅkara delves deeper into explaining what is considered unreal—that which deviates from its own essential existence. The commentary examines the transient nature of the body in contrast to the eternal nature of the Self, encouraging Arjuna to perform his duty without attachment or fear.

---

## **III. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**Question:** "What then is that unreal which departs from its own essential existence?"

**Answer:**

1. **अन्तः विनाशः विद्यते येषां ते अन्तवन्तः ।**

   "Those whose end (destruction) exists—they are 'antavantaḥ' (having an end)."

2. **यथा मृगतृष्णिकादौ सद्बुद्धिः अनुवृत्ता प्रमाण-निर्पूणान्ते विच्छिद्यते, स तस्य अन्तः ;**

   "Just as in a mirage and similar illusions, the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhiḥ*) continues until the determination by valid means of knowledge (*pramāṇa-nirūpaṇa*), and then it is interrupted—that is its end."

3. **तथा इमे देहाः स्वप्न-माया-देह-आदि-वच्च अन्तवन्तः ;**

   "Similarly, these bodies are perishable, like bodies in a dream or created by magic."

4. **नित्यस्य शरीरिणः शरीरवतः अनाशिनः अप्रमेयस्य आत्मनः अन्तवन्त इति उक्ताः विवेकिभिः इत्यर्थः ।**

   "Thus, the bodies of the eternal, indestructible, immeasurable Self—the embodied one—are said by the wise to have an end."

5. **'नित्यस्य' 'अनाशिनः' इति न पुनरुक्तम् ; नित्यत्वस्य द्विविधत्वात् लोके, नाशस्य च ।**

   "'Eternal' (*nityasya*) and 'indestructible' (*anāśinaḥ*)—this is not a redundancy, because in the world, eternality and destruction are of two kinds."

6. **यथा देहो भस्मीभूतः अदर्शनं गतः नष्टः उच्यते ।**

   "For example, when the body becomes ashes and disappears, it is said to be destroyed."

7. **विद्यमानः अपि यथा अन्यथा परिणतः व्याध्यादि-युक्तो जातः नष्टः उच्यते ।**

   "Also, even when existing, if it transforms differently, afflicted by disease, etc., it is said to be destroyed."

8. **तत्र 'नित्यस्य' 'अनाशिनः' इति द्विविधेन अपि नाशेन असम्बन्धः अस्य इत्यर्थः ।**

   "Therefore, 'eternal' and 'indestructible' mean that it is unassociated with both kinds of destruction."

9. **अन्यथा पृथिव्यादिवत् अपि नित्यत्वं स्यात् आत्मनः ; तत् मा भूद् इति 'नित्यस्य' 'अनाशिनः' इति आह ।**

   "Otherwise, the Self might be considered eternal like the earth and so on; to prevent that, it is said 'eternal' and 'indestructible.'"

10. **अप्रमेयस्य न प्रमेयस्य प्रत्यक्ष-आदि-प्रमाणैः अपरिच्छेद्यस्य इति अर्थः ।**

    "'Immeasurable' (*aprameyasya*) means not an object of knowledge (*prameya*), not delimited by means of knowledge like perception and so on."

---

## **V. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Understanding 'Antavantaḥ' (Having an End)**

- **Definition**: Entities that are subject to destruction are called 'antavantaḥ.'
- **Analogy of Mirage**: In a mirage, the cognition of water's existence persists until corrected by valid knowledge, at which point it ceases—this cessation is the 'end.'
- **Application to Bodies**: Similarly, the physical bodies are perishable; they have an end like the illusory bodies in dreams or magic.

### **2. The Eternal Self vs. Perishable Bodies**

- **Eternal Embodied One**: The Self is eternal (*nitya*), indestructible (*anāśin*), and immeasurable (*aprameya*).
- **Bodies Are Perishable**: The bodies housing the Self are impermanent and subject to destruction.
- **Wise Understanding**: The discriminating ones (*vivekibhiḥ*) recognize this distinction between the eternal Self and the perishable body.

### **3. Clarifying 'Nitya' and 'Anāśin'**

- **Avoiding Redundancy**: Using both 'eternal' and 'indestructible' is not redundant because each addresses different aspects of destruction.
- **Two Kinds of Eternity**: In the world, something may be considered eternal in two ways, and destruction occurs in two ways.
  - **Complete Destruction**: When something is utterly annihilated, like a body reduced to ashes.
  - **Transformation**: When something changes form, such as a healthy body becoming diseased.

- **Self's Independence from Both Destructions**: The Self is unassociated with both types of destruction—it neither ceases to exist nor undergoes transformation.

### **4. Immeasurability of the Self**

- **Not an Object of Knowledge**: The Self is 'aprameya'—not measurable or definable by conventional means of knowledge like perception, inference, etc.
- **Beyond Comprehension**: The Self cannot be fully grasped through sensory experiences or intellectual reasoning.

### **5. Preventing Misconceptions**

- **Not Like Earth or Elements**: The Self is not eternal in the same way as elements like earth, which are subject to transformation and decay.
- **Emphasis on Unchanging Nature**: By stating 'eternal' and 'indestructible,' it is emphasized that the Self is unchanging and unaffected by any form of destruction.

---

## **VI. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Teachings**

- **Reality of the Self**: The Self is the only true, eternal reality, unchanging and indestructible.
- **Illusory Nature of the Body**: The body is transient, subject to change and destruction, and thus considered unreal in the ultimate sense.
- **Knowledge and Ignorance**: The continuation of false cognition (e.g., seeing water in a mirage) represents ignorance, which is dispelled by true knowledge.

### **2. Nature of Destruction and Eternity**

- **Two Types of Destruction**:
  - **Absolute Destruction**: Complete annihilation, where an entity ceases to exist entirely.
  - **Relative Destruction**: Transformation into another state, leading to a functional end.

- **Self's Immunity**: The Self is immune to both types of destruction, affirming its absolute eternality.

### **3. Immeasurability of the Self**

- **Beyond Empirical Knowledge**: The Self cannot be known through sensory perception or intellectual inference.
- **Necessity of Direct Realization**: Understanding the Self requires transcendental knowledge, beyond ordinary means.

---

## **VII. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Cultivating Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Distinguish Self from Body**: Recognize the impermanent nature of the body and the eternal nature of the Self.
- **Question Appearances**: Like the mirage analogy, question perceptions and seek true knowledge.

### **2. Overcoming Attachment**

- **Let Go of Body Identification**: Reduce attachment to the physical body and its conditions.
- **Focus on the Eternal**: Direct attention and devotion towards realizing the immutable Self.

### **3. Seeking True Knowledge**

- **Transcend Conventional Means**: Understand that the Self is beyond sensory perception and intellectual reasoning.
- **Pursue Direct Experience**: Engage in meditation and spiritual practices that lead to direct realization.

### **4. Embracing Impermanence**

- **Accept the Body's Transience**: Acknowledge that physical changes and eventual death are natural.
- **Find Stability in the Self**: Anchor your sense of identity in the unchanging Self rather than the changing body.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

In this segment, Śaṅkara explains that the bodies are perishable (*antavantaḥ*) and have an end, much like the false perception of water in a mirage ceases upon gaining true knowledge. The eternal Self (*nitya*, *anāśin*, *aprameya*) is unassociated with both types of destruction recognized in the world: complete annihilation and transformation. By emphasizing that the Self is both eternal and indestructible, Śaṅkara clarifies that it is not eternal in the same way as material elements like earth, which are subject to change. The Self is also immeasurable, not being an object of knowledge accessible through conventional means. Understanding this distinction between the transient body and the eternal Self is essential for spiritual growth and liberation.

---

## **IX. Next Steps**

### **1. Reflect on the Teachings**

- **Contemplate the Nature of the Self**: Spend time in meditation reflecting on the eternal, indestructible nature of the Self.
- **Examine Personal Attachments**: Identify and question attachments to the physical body and material conditions.

### **2. Deepen Spiritual Practice**

- **Study Scriptures**: Continue studying the Bhagavad Gītā and Śaṅkara's commentaries to deepen understanding.
- **Seek Guidance**: Consider learning from a qualified teacher who can provide insights into these profound concepts.

### **3. Apply Wisdom in Daily Life**

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed to the next segment of the Bhāṣya or if you have any questions or topics you'd like to explore further.

---

## **I. Contextual Introduction**

In this segment, **Śaṅkara** addresses a potential objection regarding the nature of the Self (*Ātman*) as being **immeasurable** (*aprameya*), as mentioned in the previous commentary. The objection suggests that the Self is known through the scriptures (*Āgama*) and through direct perception and other means of knowledge (*pramāṇas*). Śaṅkara refutes this by emphasizing that the Self is self-evident and not an object of knowledge that needs to be established through external means. He explains that the role of the scriptures is not to reveal the unknown Self but to remove misconceptions superimposed upon it.

---

## **II. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

1. **Objection:**

   **"But the Self is determined by the scriptures (*Āgama*) and previously by perception and other means."**

   - **ननु आगमेन आत्मा परिच्छिद्यते, प्रत्यक्षादिना च पूर्वम् ।**

2. **Answer:**

   **"No; because the Self is self-established."**

   - **न; आत्मनः स्वतःसिद्धत्वात् ।**

3. **Explanation:**

   **"Indeed, when the Self—the knower (*pramātṛ*), who desires to know—is established, then the search for means of knowledge (*pramāṇa*) occurs."**

   - **सिद्धे हि आत्मनि प्रमातरि प्रमित्सोः प्रमाणान्वेषणा भवति ।**

4. **Further Clarification:**

   **"For one does not, without first cognizing oneself as 'Thus I am,' proceed to determine the object of knowledge (*prameya*)."**

   - **न हि पूर्वम् 'इत्थम् अहम्' इति आत्मानम् अप्रमाय पश्चात् प्रमेयपरिच्छेदाय प्रवर्तते ।**

5. **Emphasis on Self-Evidence:**

   **"Indeed, the Self is never unknown to anyone."**

   - **न हि आत्मा नाम कस्यचित् अप्रसिद्धो भवति ।**

6. **Role of Scripture:**

   **"But the scripture (*śāstra*) is the ultimate means of knowledge concerning the Self, only in the sense of removing the superimposition of attributes not belonging to It (*anātman*), and not by revealing something previously unknown."**

   - **शास्त्रं तु अन्त्यं प्रमाणम् अतद्धर्माध्यारोपणमात्रनिवर्तकत्वेन प्रमाणत्वम् आत्मनः प्रतिपद्यते, न तु अज्ञातार्थज्ञापकत्वेन ।**

7. **Support from Scripture:**

   **"And so the Śruti says: 'That which is the Brahman that is immediate and direct—the Self that is within all.'"**

   - **तथा च श्रुतिः—'यत् साक्षाद् अपरोक्षाद् ब्रह्म यः आत्मा सर्वान्तरः' (बृ. उ. ३ । ४ । १) इति ।**

   *(Reference: Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.4.1)*

---

## **IV. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Objection Regarding the Knowability of the Self**

- **Assertion**: The objector claims that the Self is known through scriptures and prior means like perception.
- **Implication**: If the Self is known through external means, it is an object like any other, subject to being measured and defined.

### **2. Śaṅkara's Refutation**

- **Self is Self-Evident**: The Self does not require any external means to be known because it is self-established (*svataḥ-siddha*).
- **Prerequisite for Knowledge Seeking**: One must already be aware of oneself as the knower before seeking knowledge about objects.
- **Logical Sequence**: The cognition 'I am this way' is inherent and does not depend on external validation.

### **3. Role of the Self in Knowledge Acquisition**

- **Knower and Means of Knowledge**: The Self as the knower initiates the search for means of knowledge to understand objects.
- **Impossibility of Not Knowing the Self**: It is illogical to seek knowledge without first being aware of oneself as the seeker.

### **4. The Function of Scriptures**

- **Not to Reveal the Unknown Self**: Scriptures do not serve to make the Self known as if it were previously unknown.
- **Removal of Misconceptions**: Their role is to eliminate false superimpositions—attributes mistakenly ascribed to the Self.
- **Ultimate Means**: Scriptures are considered the final authority in negating ignorance about the Self.

### **5. Support from Upaniṣadic Scripture**

- **Direct Experience of the Self**: The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad states that the Self is immediate and directly experienced.
- **Innermost Essence**: The Self is the innermost reality of all beings, not an external object to be measured.

---

## **V. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Nature of the Self in Advaita Vedānta**

- **Self as Self-Evident**: The Self is ever-present and self-aware; it does not require validation from external means.
- **Not an Object**: The Self is the subject, the witness of all experiences, and cannot be objectified.

### **2. Limitations of Means of Knowledge**

- **Perception and Inference**: These are valid for knowing external objects but cannot grasp the Self.
- **Scriptural Role**: Scriptures are unique in that they help remove ignorance but do not make the Self known in the conventional sense.

### **3. Superimposition and Ignorance**

- **False Attributes**: Ignorance leads to attributing qualities like doership, enjoyership, and limitations to the Self.
- **Removal Process**: Knowledge, especially as revealed in scriptures, removes these false notions.

### **4. Direct Realization**

- **Immediate Knowledge**: Realization of the Self is direct and immediate, not mediated by any instruments.
- **Inner Experience**: The Self is experienced internally as one's own existence and consciousness.

---

## **VI. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Self-Inquiry (Atma Vichara)**

- **Turn Inward**: Focus on the immediate awareness of 'I am' rather than seeking the Self through external means.
- **Question Misconceptions**: Identify and discard false beliefs about the Self imposed by ignorance.

### **2. Study of Scriptures**

- **Purposeful Engagement**: Read scriptures not to find the Self but to understand and eliminate misconceptions.
- **Guided Reflection**: Use scriptural teachings to reflect on the true nature of the Self.

### **3. Meditation and Contemplation**

- **Direct Experience**: Meditate on the Self as pure consciousness, beyond attributes and limitations.
- **Witness Consciousness**: Practice being the observer of thoughts and experiences without identification.

### **4. Letting Go of False Identities**

- **Recognize Superimpositions**: Acknowledge qualities mistakenly attributed to the Self, such as being the body or mind.
- **Disidentify**: Gradually disassociate from these false identities to experience the true Self.

---

## **VII. Summary**

In this passage, Śaṅkara refutes the notion that the Self is known through scriptures or conventional means of knowledge like perception and inference. He asserts that the Self is self-evident and ever-present as the knower in all acts of knowing. One does not need to establish the existence of the Self before seeking knowledge; rather, the very act of seeking presupposes the Self's existence.

The role of the scriptures is not to reveal the Self but to remove the superimposed attributes that are not intrinsic to It. These false attributes arise due to ignorance, leading to misidentification with the body, mind, and senses. By eliminating these misconceptions, one can recognize the Self as it truly is—eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable.

Śaṅkara supports his argument with a citation from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, emphasizing that the Self is immediate and directly known, being the innermost essence of all beings. This understanding is crucial for spiritual aspirants aiming for liberation, as it redirects the focus inward, encouraging direct realization of the Self.

- **Mindfulness Practice**: Cultivate constant awareness of your own existence and consciousness.
- **Self-Reflection**: Regularly reflect on the nature of the 'I' that is ever-present.

### **2. Continue Scriptural Study**

- **Commentaries**: Explore Śaṅkara's commentaries to understand the non-dual perspective.

### **3. Engage in Satsang**

- **Spiritual Community**: Participate in discussions with fellow seekers to share experiences and insights.
- **Guidance**: Seek guidance from realized teachers who can help clarify doubts.

### **4. Practical Application**

- **Discerning the Real from the Unreal**: Apply discrimination in daily life to distinguish the Self from non-Self.
- **Letting Go**: Practice non-attachment to the body, mind, and external possessions, recognizing them as not-Self.
