# BG 2.39 Technical Analysis

## I. Śaṅkara's Introduction

### Sanskrit
शोकमोहापनयनाय लौकिको न्यायः 'स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य' (भ. गी. २ । ३१) इत्याद्यैः श्लोकैरुक्तः, न तु तात्पर्येण । परमार्थदर्शनमिह प्रकृतम् । तच्चोक्तमुपसंह्रियते — 'एषा तेऽभिहिता' (भ. गी. २ । ३९) इति शास्त्रविषयविभागप्रदर्शनाय । इह हि प्रदर्शिते पुनः शास्त्रविषयविभागे उपरिष्टात् 'ज्ञानयोगेन साङ्‍ख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्' (भ. गी. ३ । ३) इति निष्ठाद्वयविषयं शास्त्रं सुखं प्रवर्तिष्यते, श्रोतारश्च विषयविभागेन सुखं ग्रहीष्यन्ति इत्यत आह —

### Transliteration
śokamohāpanayanāya laukiko nyāyaḥ 'svadharmamapi cāvekṣya' (BG 2.31) ityādyaiḥ ślokairuktaḥ, na tu tātparyeṇa | paramārthadarśanamiha prakṛtam | tacccoktamupasaṃhriyate — 'eṣā te'bhihitā' (BG 2.39) iti śāstraviṣayavibhāgadarśanāya | iha hi pradarśite punaḥ śāstraviṣayavibhāge upariṣṭāt 'jñānayogena sāṅkhyānāṃ karmayogena yoginām' (BG 3.3) iti niṣṭhādvayaviṣayaṃ śāstraṃ sukhaṃ pravartiṣyate, śrotāraśca viṣayavibhāgena sukhaṃ grahīṣyanti ityata āha —

### Translation
The worldly reasoning stated in verses beginning with "Even considering your own dharma" (BG 2.31) was for removing grief and delusion, but not as the primary meaning. The vision of supreme truth is the subject here. That teaching is now being concluded - "This has been taught to you" (BG 2.39) - for showing the division of scriptural subjects. For when this division of scripture is shown here, above in "Through knowledge-yoga for the Sāṅkhyas, through action-yoga for the yogis" (BG 3.3), the scripture dealing with the two established paths will proceed smoothly, and listeners will easily grasp it through the division of subjects. Therefore he says:

## II. Mūla Verse
