### Translation
"Bewildered by what has been heard" - your understanding which is bewildered, scattered in various directions by hearing śrutis that reveal the relationship of many means and ends, characterized by engagement and withdrawal; when at that time it becomes steady, becomes firm, motionless, free from distraction and movement in samādhi - samādhi means that in which the mind is established, the Self, in that Self, this is the meaning. "Immovable" means there also free from alternatives. Buddhi means the inner organ. Then, at that time, you will attain yoga, you will attain discriminative wisdom, samādhi.
