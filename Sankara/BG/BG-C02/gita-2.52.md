## III. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit
यदा यस्मिन्काले ते तव मोहकलिलं मोहात्मकमविवेकरूपं कालुष्यं येन आत्मानात्मविवेकबोधं कलुषीकृत्य विषयं प्रत्यन्तःकरणं प्रवर्तते, तत् तव बुद्धिः व्यतितरिष्यति व्यतिक्रमिष्यति, अतिशुद्धभावमापत्स्यते इत्यर्थः । तदा तस्मिन् काले गन्तासि प्राप्स्यसि निर्वेदं वैराग्यं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च, तदा श्रोतव्यं श्रुतं च ते निष्फलं प्रतिभातीत्यभिप्रायः ॥ ५२ ॥

### Transliteration
yadā yasmin kāle te tava mohakalilaṃ mohātmakam avivekarūpaṃ kāluṣyaṃ yena ātmānātmavivekabodhaṃ kaluṣīkṛtya viṣayaṃ pratyantaḥkaraṇaṃ pravartate, tat tava buddhiḥ vyatitariṣyati vyatikramiṣyati, atiśuddhabhāvam āpatsyate ityarthaḥ | tadā tasmin kāle gantāsi prāpsyasi nirvedaṃ vairāgyaṃ śrotavyasya śrutasya ca, tadā śrotavyaṃ śrutaṃ ca te niṣphalaṃ pratibhātītyabhiprāyaḥ || 52 ||

### Translation
When, at which time, your mohakalilaṃ - the turbidity which is of the nature of delusion, of the form of non-discrimination, by which the understanding of discrimination between Self and non-Self is made turbid and the inner organ proceeds towards objects - when your understanding will cross beyond that, will transcend it, meaning will attain an extremely pure state. Then, at that time, you will attain dispassion, non-attachment towards what is to be heard and what has been heard; meaning then what is to be heard and what has been heard will appear fruitless to you.
