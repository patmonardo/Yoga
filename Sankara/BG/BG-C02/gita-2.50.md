### Sanskrit
बुद्धियुक्तः कर्मसमत्वविषयया बुद्ध्या युक्तः बुद्धियुक्तः सः जहाति परित्यजति इह अस्मिन् लोके उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते पुण्यपापे सत्त्वशुद्धिज्ञानप्राप्तिद्वारेण यतः, तस्मात् समत्वबुद्धियोगाय युज्यस्व घटस्व । योगो हि कर्मसु कौशलम् , स्वधर्माख्येषु कर्मसु वर्तमानस्य या सिद्ध्यासिद्ध्योः समत्वबुद्धिः ईश्वरार्पितचेतस्तया तत् कौशलं कुशलभावः । तद्धि कौशलं यत् बन्धनस्वभावान्यपि कर्माणि समत्वबुद्ध्या स्वभावात् निवर्तन्ते । तस्मात्समत्वबुद्धियुक्तो भव त्वम् ॥ ५० ॥

### Transliteration
buddhiyuktaḥ karmasamatvaviṣayayā buddhyā yuktaḥ buddhiyuktaḥ saḥ jahāti parityajati iha asmin loke ubhe sukṛtaduṣkṛte puṇyapāpe sattvaśuddhijñānaprāptidvāreṇa yataḥ, tasmāt samatvabuddhiyogāya yujyasva ghaṭasva | yogo hi karmasu kauśalam, svadharmākhyeṣu karmasu vartamānasya yā siddhyāsiddhyoḥ samatvabuddhiḥ īśvarārpitacetastayā tat kauśalaṃ kuśalabhāvaḥ | taddhi kauśalaṃ yat bandhanasvabhāvānyapi karmāṇi samatvabuddhyā svabhāvāt nivartante | tasmātsamatvabuddhiyukto bhava tvam || 50 ||

### Translation
"United with understanding" means united with the understanding concerning equanimity in action; that one "abandons," gives up "here," in this world, "both good and evil deeds," merit and demerit, through the means of purity of being and attainment of knowledge. Therefore, devote yourself, strive for the yoga of equanimity of understanding. For yoga is skill in actions - that equanimity of understanding in success and failure which one has while engaged in actions known as one's own dharma, with mind offered to the Lord, that is skill, the state of being skilled. For that is skill by which even actions whose nature is binding turn back from their nature through equanimity of understanding. Therefore, become united with equanimity of understanding.
