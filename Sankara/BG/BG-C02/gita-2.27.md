तथा च सति —

जातस्य हि लब्धजन्मनः ध्रुवः अव्यभिचारी मृत्युः मरणं ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च । तस्मादपरिहार्योऽयं जन्ममरणलक्षणोऽर्थः । तस्मिन्नपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥ २७ ॥
```
Let's analyze **Verse 27** in a similar style as the previous one. This verse continues to address the inevitability of birth and death, reinforcing the eternal nature of the ātman.

### **Transliteration of Verse 27:**

**tathā ca sati**
**jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyur dhruvaṃ janma mṛtasya ca**
**tasmād aparihārye’rthe na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi**

---

### **Sanskrit Commentary:**

**1. "तथा च सति" (tathā ca sati)**

- **"tathā"**: "Thus," indicating a continuation of the previous thought.
- **"ca"**: "And," linking the current statement to the previous verse.
- **"sati"**: "In existence" or "when it is so."
  - This phrase sets the stage for the next point, referring to the inevitability of death and birth in the material world.

**2. "जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च" (jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyur dhruvaṃ janma mṛtasya ca)**

- **"jātasya hi"**: "For one who is born."
  - Refers to the beings in the world who are born and subject to the cycle of life and death.
- **"dhruvo mṛtyur"**: "Death is certain."
  - It indicates that death is inevitable for all beings that are born.
- **"dhruvaṃ janma"**: "Birth is certain."
  - Birth is also inevitable for all beings, marking the beginning of their earthly existence.
- **"mṛtasya ca"**: "And death follows those who are born."
  - This emphasizes that death inevitably follows birth. It establishes the cyclical nature of life and death in the material world.

**Interpretation**: The verse establishes the law of nature: for every being that is born, death is certain, and for those who die, birth has preceded them. This cyclical process is inevitable and cannot be avoided. The body is bound to birth and death.

**3. "तस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि" (tasmād aparihārye’rthe na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi)**

- **"tasmāt"**: "Therefore," following from the inevitability of birth and death.
- **"aparihārye’rthe"**: "In the case of something that cannot be avoided."
  - Refers to the inevitable nature of death and birth, which cannot be bypassed or escaped.
- **"na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi"**: "You should not grieve."
  - Krishna advises Arjuna not to grieve over something that is unavoidable, indicating that grief over death is misguided because it is part of the natural order.

**Interpretation**: Krishna tells Arjuna that since birth and death are inevitable and cannot be avoided, there is no point in grieving over them. This teaching directs Arjuna to understand the cycle of life and death as a natural and unavoidable process, and thus not to lament the passing of individuals.

### **Śaṅkara's Insights:**

Śaṅkara explains that the reality of birth and death is intrinsic to the material world, where every being is bound by these natural laws. He clarifies that:

1. **Death is as certain as birth**: Every entity that is born must die, and every death is preceded by birth. This is a universal principle within the realm of worldly existence.
2. **The nature of the body**: The body is not the true Self (ātman). It is subject to the laws of nature, such as birth and death. The ātman, however, is beyond this cycle of birth and death, as it is eternal and indestructible.
3. **Grief is based on ignorance**: Grief arises when one identifies with the body and mistakes the impermanent for the permanent. Krishna urges Arjuna to rise above this ignorance and recognize the eternal nature of the ātman.

### **Practical Application:**

Arjuna is urged to relinquish his grief, as it arises from attachment to the physical body. Understanding the certainty of birth and death helps one transcend sorrow and see the reality that the ātman, the true Self, remains unchanged and unaffected by these cycles. Death, though painful, is part of the natural process, and one should not grieve over it, as the soul (ātman) continues its existence beyond the material world.

---

This verse reinforces the cyclical nature of life and death, encouraging Arjuna to understand the impermanence of the body and the eternal nature of the Self. By doing so, he is advised to rise above his sorrow and focus on his duty without attachment.

Let me know if this style is consistent with what you had in mind and if you'd like to continue with the next verse!
