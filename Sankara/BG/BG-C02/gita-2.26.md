आत्मनः अनित्यत्वमभ्युपगम्य इदमुच्यते —

Let's break down **Verse 26** in detail. The verse addresses the concept of the eternity and the indestructibility of the ātman (Self) in relation to death and birth.

### **Transliteration of Verse 26:**

   **athā cainam nityajātaṁ nityaṁ vā manyase mṛtam**
   **tathāpi tvaṁ mahābāho naivaṁ śocitum arhasi**

### **Sanskrit Commentary:**

**1. "अथ च इति अभ्युपगमार्थः" (atha ca iti abhyupagāmārthaḥ)**

- **"atha"**: "Now," indicating a shift in the argument.
- **"ca"**: "And," continuing the reasoning.
- **"abhyupagāmārthaḥ"**: "The purpose of the previous conclusion is this."
  - Here, the phrase refers to the idea that the nature of the ātman (Self) has been established in prior verses. This verse explains that regardless of how the ātman is perceived, it remains eternal and unaffected by physical phenomena like birth and death.

**2. "एनं प्रकृतमात्मानं नित्यजातं लोकप्रसिद्ध्या प्रत्यनेकशरीरोत्पत्ति जातो जात इति मन्यसे" (enaṃ prakṛtam ātmānaṃ nityajātaṃ loka prasiddhyā pratyanekaśarīrotpatti jāto jāta iti manyase)**

- **"enaṃ prakṛtam ātmānaṃ"**: "This material body, which you consider to be the Self."
  - The verse refers to the body, which is mistakenly equated with the Self (ātman).
- **"nityajātaṃ"**: "Eternally born."
  - The self is misunderstood as being repeatedly born, subject to continuous cycles of birth.
- **"lokaprasiddhyā"**: "As is commonly known or believed in the world."
  - This refers to the conventional view that beings are born repeatedly in various bodies.
- **"pratyanekaśarīrotpatti"**: "In the repeated birth of bodies."
  - This refers to the belief that the self undergoes birth in various bodies, implying a cycle of rebirth.
- **"jāto jāta iti manyase"**: "You think that it is born again and again."
  - Here, Krishna is addressing Arjuna's misconception of ātman as something subject to continual birth.

**Interpretation**: Arjuna mistakenly believes that the Self (ātman) is born repeatedly in different bodies, which is a common worldly perception. However, Krishna aims to correct this view by establishing the true nature of ātman.

**3. "तथा प्रतितत्तद्विनाशं नित्यं वा मन्यसे मृतं मृतो मृत इति" (tathā pratitattad vināśaṃ nityaṃ vā manyase mṛtaṃ mṛto mṛta iti)**

- **"tathā pratitattad vināśaṃ"**: "Similarly, you think that it is subject to complete destruction."
  - Arjuna believes that the Self undergoes annihilation or destruction.
- **"nityaṃ vā"**: "Or you think it is eternal."
  - Arjuna also considers the Self to be eternal, which is contradictory to the belief of it being subject to death.
- **"manyase mṛtaṃ"**: "You consider it as dead."
  - Arjuna perceives the ātman to be subject to death, causing him to grieve.
- **"mṛto mṛta iti"**: "It is said to be dead and gone."
  - This repeats the view that the Self is lost in death, further reinforcing Arjuna's misconception.

**Interpretation**: The verse highlights Arjuna's confusion in perceiving the ātman as something that both dies and is eternal. This duality arises because of his attachment to the body and worldly concepts of birth and death.

**4. "तथापि तथाभावेऽपि आत्मनि त्वं महाबाहो, न एवं शोचितुमर्हसि" (tathāpi tathābhāve’pi ātmāni tvaṃ mahābāho, na evaṃ śocitum arhasi)**

- **"tathāpi"**: "Even so,"
- **"tathābhāve’pi"**: "In this situation (where such false beliefs exist),"
- **"ātmani"**: "The Self (ātman)"
- **"tvaṃ mahābāho"**: "You, mighty-armed one (Arjuna)."
- **"na evaṃ śocitum arhasi"**: "Should not grieve thus."
  - Krishna tells Arjuna that even if he holds such views, it is improper to mourn the loss of the Self because it remains eternal, regardless of the body’s birth and death.

**Interpretation**: Krishna advises Arjuna not to grieve the death of the body (and those who die) because the true Self is eternal, unaffected by the body’s life cycle. This section establishes the principle that the ātman is beyond destruction and impervious to the material world’s laws of death.

### **Śaṅkara's Insights:**

Śaṅkara explains that the apparent birth and death of beings are attributed to the physical bodies (which are temporary) and not to the eternal ātman. He clarifies that:
1. The ātman is beyond the transient nature of the body.
2. Birth and death refer only to the physical manifestation (the body) and do not affect the true Self (ātman), which is unchanging, indestructible, and eternal.
3. Even when the body undergoes change or destruction, the ātman remains unaffected and continues its existence beyond such changes.

### **Practical Application:**

Arjuna is urged to transcend his attachment to the body and view the death of individuals with the understanding that their true selves (ātman) are eternal. There is no need for sorrow because the essence of all beings remains unchanged, regardless of the birth and death of the body.

Thus, Krishna’s teaching here points to the deeper understanding of the Self, highlighting its immortality and imperviousness to the cycles of birth and death.
