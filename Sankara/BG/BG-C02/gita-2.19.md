ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate || 2.19 ||*

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this verse, Lord Krishna addresses Arjuna's confusion and grief over the prospect of killing his relatives and teachers in battle. Arjuna believes that he would be the killer of revered figures like Bhīṣma and Droṇa, leading to sin and suffering. Śaṅkara, in his commentary, emphasizes that the purpose of the Gītā is to remove the causes of worldly existence—grief and delusion—not to incite action for its own sake. By bringing in this teaching, Lord Krishna aims to dispel Arjuna's misunderstanding about the nature of the Self and the implications of action.

## **III. Translation and Analysis of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**1. Introduction:**

**शोक-मोह-आदि-संसार-कारण-निवृत्ति-अर्थः गीताशास्त्रम्, न प्रवर्तकम् इत्येतस्य अर्थस्य साक्षि-भूते ऋचौ आनीनाय भगवान् ।**

*"The Gītā scripture is intended for the removal of the causes of worldly existence, such as grief and delusion, not for inciting action. To testify to this meaning, the Blessed Lord brings in the supporting Vedic verse."*

- **Explanation:** Śaṅkara states that the primary purpose of the Gītā is to eliminate grief and delusion, which are the causes of worldly bondage. It is not merely a text promoting action. To reinforce this, Lord Krishna refers to a verse that clarifies the nature of the Self.

---

**2. Addressing Arjuna's Misconception:**

**यत्तु मन्यसे 'युद्धे भीष्मादयो मया हन्यन्ते' 'अहमेव तेषां हन्ता' इति, एषा बुद्धिः मृषैव ते ।**

*"Moreover, if you think, 'In battle, Bhīṣma and others will be killed by me,' and 'I am indeed their killer,' this understanding of yours is indeed false."*

- **Explanation:** Arjuna believes that he will be the agent responsible for killing his revered elders, which causes him distress. Śaṅkara points out that this belief is based on a misunderstanding of the true nature of the Self.

---

**3. Raising the Question:**

**कथम्?**

*"How (is this understanding false)?"*

- **Explanation:** This rhetorical question prompts the explanation of why Arjuna's belief is incorrect.

---

**4. Quoting the Verse:**

**य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम् ।
उभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते ॥ १९ ॥**

*"He who thinks this Self to be the slayer and he who thinks it to be slain—both of them do not know; this Self neither slays nor is slain."*

- **Explanation:** The verse is cited to demonstrate that the Self is beyond action and change, and therefore, concepts of killing or being killed do not apply to it.

---

**5. Elaborating on the Verse:**

**य एनं प्रकृतं देहिनं वेत्ति विजानाति हन्तारं हनन-क्रियायाः कर्तारं यश्च एनम् अन्यः मन्यते हतम् देह-हननेन 'हतः अहम्' इति हनन-क्रियायाः कर्म-भूतम्, तौ उभौ न विजानीतः न ज्ञातवन्तौ अविवेकेन आत्मानम् ।**

*"He who considers this embodied Self under discussion as the killer—the agent of the act of killing—and he who thinks of this Self as being killed due to the killing of the body, thinking 'I am killed'—both of them do not know; they have not known the Self due to lack of discrimination."*

- **Explanation:** Those who identify the Self with the body believe that the Self can perform actions like killing or be subject to actions like being killed. This misunderstanding arises from a lack of discrimination between the eternal Self and the transient body.

---

**6. Clarifying Misconceptions:**

**'हन्ता अहम्' 'हतः अस्मि अहम्' इति देह-हननेन आत्मानम् अहं-प्रत्यय-विषयं यौ विजानीतः तौ आत्म-स्वरूप-अनभिज्ञौ इति अर्थः ।**

*"Those who think 'I am the killer' or 'I am killed,' taking the Self, the object of the 'I'-cognition, to be affected by the killing of the body—those are unacquainted with the true nature of the Self; that is the meaning."*

- **Explanation:** The 'I'-sense is mistakenly associated with the body, leading individuals to believe that the Self is involved in actions and experiences. This error prevents them from realizing the Self's true, unchanging nature.

---

**7. The True Nature of the Self:**

**यस्मात् न अयम् आत्मा हन्ति न हनन-क्रियायाः कर्ता भवति, न च हन्यते न च कर्म भवति इत्यर्थः, अविक्रियत्वात् ।**

*"Because this Self does not kill—it does not become the agent of the act of killing—nor is it killed, nor does it become the object of action; that is the meaning, because it is unchanging."*

- **Explanation:** The Self is immutable and does not participate in actions. It neither performs actions nor is affected by them. This understanding arises from recognizing the Self's nature as beyond all modifications.

## **VIII. Summary**

In this passage, Śaṅkara explains that the belief in oneself as the killer or the killed arises from ignorance and misidentification with the body. The Self, being eternal and unchanging, is not subject to actions like killing or being killed. Both the notions of 'I am the slayer' and 'I am slain' reflect a lack of true knowledge about the Self's nature. By understanding that the Self neither acts nor is acted upon, one can transcend grief, fear, and delusion. This realization enables one to perform duties without attachment, leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
