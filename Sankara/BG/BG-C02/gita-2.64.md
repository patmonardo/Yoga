Below is the analysis of **Bhagavad Gītā 2.64**, continuing the integrative approach and the **Being / Essence / Concept** structure. In this verse, the Gītā introduces the positive alternative to the downward spiral described earlier. Having shown that dwelling on sense objects leads to destruction of discernment, the text now instructs that the way to avoid that fate is to move beyond likes and dislikes (rāga and dveṣa) and control the senses internally (ātmavaśyair indriyaiḥ). This inner discipline opens the way to ekāgratā — the one-pointedness that is the heart of dhāraṇā, a key step in achieving deeper meditative states and stable wisdom.

# Technical Analysis Artifact: Bhagavad Gītā 2.64

### I. Mūla Verse

**Sanskrit**
```markdown
रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् ।
आत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति ॥ ६४ ॥
```

**Transliteration**
```markdown
rāga-dveṣa-viyuktais tu viṣayān indriyaiś caran |
ātma-vaśyair vidheyātmā prasādam adhigacchati || 64 ||
```

**Translation**
"One who, free from attraction and aversion, moves among the objects of the senses with senses under one’s own control, having a well-directed mind, attains tranquility (prasāda)."

### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

**Sanskrit Original (Provided Text)**
```markdown
रागद्वेषवियुक्तैः ... इन्द्रियैः ... आत्मवश्यैः ... विधेयात्मा ...
प्रसादम् अधिगच्छति । प्रसादः प्रसन्नता स्वास्थ्यम् ॥ ६४ ॥
```

**Key Points from the Bhāṣya**:
- Rāga (attachment) and dveṣa (aversion) are natural tendencies of the senses. The advanced seeker is one who is free of these, i.e., not controlled by likes and dislikes.
- The senses, now ātma-vaśya (under the control of the Self), operate among sense objects without creating inner turmoil.
- Vidheyātmā: One whose inner instrument (antaḥkaraṇa) is well-governed and disciplined.
- As a result, the practitioner attains prasāda (tranquility, clarity, and calmness), a mental purity akin to a stable, luminous mental field.

### III. Term Analysis

**Key Terms from Mūla Verse**:

- **रागद्वेषवियुक्त (rāga-dveṣa-viyukta)**: Free from attachment and aversion
  *Contextual Significance*: Without rāga and dveṣa, the mind can remain stable and balanced. This neutrality paves the way for the mind to become ekāgra (one-pointed), as it no longer gets pulled in multiple directions by preferences and fears.

- **आत्मवश्य (ātma-vaśya)**: Under the control of the Self
  *Contextual Significance*: Self-mastery is key for progressing toward dhāraṇā, which requires steady directing of attention. If the senses serve the mind’s higher purpose rather than dictating it, the mind can rest steadily on a chosen object.

- **विधेयात्मा (vidheyātmā)**: One whose mind is well-directed or disciplined
  *Contextual Significance*: Discipline is the heart of dhāraṇā. The mind is not scattered; it can be placed on what the practitioner intends — i.e., it can become ekāgra, the essence of concentration that leads to dhyāna and samādhi.

- **प्रसाद (prasāda)**: Tranquility, clarity, mental ease
  *Contextual Significance*: A mind at prasāda is free of turbulence. Such tranquility is essential for sustained ekāgratā. Without prasāda, concentration (dhāraṇā) is fragile.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: Before achieving this state, the mind is prone to rāga and dveṣa, constantly disturbed by what it likes or dislikes. This disturbance prevents stable attention.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: By removing attachment and aversion and bringing senses under the self’s control, the mind no longer oscillates. It becomes disciplined (vidheyātmā), setting the stage for ekāgratā (one-pointed concentration), the core of dhāraṇā.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: The end result — prasāda — is a state of mental clarity where ekāgratā can flourish. This one-pointedness is critical for progressing through the internal limbs of Yoga. Such a mind is prepared for nirodha (cessation of fluctuations) and samādhi (complete absorption), but it begins with achieving a stable focus (dhāraṇā) rooted in tranquility.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Rational-Experiential Fusion**: The Gītā rationally explains that by removing emotional biases (rāga-dveṣa), one attains an experiential state of calm. Idealist approaches would say the form of the mind shapes reality—here, shaping the mind away from dualities leads to stable perception and concentration.

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: Without attachment and aversion, dualities lose grip. The mind’s evenness mirrors a non-dual perspective where objects neither attract nor repel. This non-duality supports ekāgratā, as the mind rests naturally without distraction.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: In Buddhism, abandoning craving and aversion leads to uppekkhā (equanimity), a conducive state for jhāna (meditative absorption). Similarly, in Yoga, freedom from rāga-dveṣa provides the calm necessary for pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā. With senses mastered, ekāgratā emerges, facilitating deep meditation.

- **From Pratyāhāra to Dharana**: The previous verses showed the dangers of improper focus. Now, by controlling senses and shedding liking and disliking, the practitioner establishes a mental environment ideal for dhāraṇā. Ekāgratā, the heart of dhāraṇā, relies on this inner calm.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: Identifying with the Self, free from rāga-dveṣa, the mind no longer clings to dualistic notions. Ekāgratā is easy when the mind sees no separate “other” to be attracted or repelled by. This stable focus forms a base for realizing the Self as Brahman.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: Abhidharma notes that nonattachment (alobha) and nonhatred (adosa) lead to clarity. This clarity stabilizes attention, a prerequisite for strong concentration. The Gītā’s emphasis on prasāda aligns with Abhidharma’s calm state favorable for insight and one-pointed concentration.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.64 shows the positive counterpart to the previous verses’ warning. Without likes and dislikes, senses remain well-ordered under the self’s guidance. The mind, now free of agitation, gains prasāda (tranquility), becoming ripe for ekāgratā (one-pointedness) at the heart of dhāraṇā.

- **Bridge to Higher States**: This verse sets the conditions for moving from outward sense control (pratyāhāra) to inward focus (dhāraṇā). By achieving mental clarity and evenness, the practitioner can fix attention steadily on a single point, an essential step toward dhyāna and samādhi.

# Next Steps

- **Looking Forward**: Future verses may further describe the fruits of this tranquility and the stable wisdom that emerges. Each step reinforces why ekāgratā (one-pointed concentration) and stable prajñā depend on freedom from emotional disturbance.

- **Refining the Path**: We now have a conceptual map: from removing emotional entanglement (rāga-dveṣa) and controlling senses (pratyāhāra), to attaining clarity (prasāda) and cultivating ekāgratā (dhāraṇā), paving the way for deeper meditative states.

---

By analyzing Verse 2.64, we see how relinquishing attachment and aversion leads to a disciplined mind and tranquility, enabling the practitioner to develop ekāgratā. This single-pointed focus is the essence of dhāraṇā, bridging the earlier emphasis on avoiding mental downfall with the positive vision of stable, insight-driven meditative practice.
