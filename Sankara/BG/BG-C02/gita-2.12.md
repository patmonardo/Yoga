## **II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya Analysis**

### **Term Analysis**

#### **Key Terms from Bhāṣya:**

1. **अशोच्याः (aśocyāḥ)**: *Not to be grieved for*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to beings like Bhīṣma and Droṇa, who are eternal in their true essence and thus should not be subjects of sorrow.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Emphasizes that grief over the inevitable or eternal is misplaced.

2. **नित्याः (nityāḥ)**: *Eternal*

   - **Explanation**: Denotes the timeless nature of the Self, which is unchanging and everlasting.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Forms the basis for understanding why grief is unnecessary.

3. **जातु (jātu)**: *At any time*

   - **Explanation**: Conveys the concept of all times—past, present, and future.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Highlights the continuous existence of the Self across all temporal divisions.

4. **देहोत्पत्तिविनाशेषु (deha-utpatti-vināśeṣu)**: *In the birth and destruction of bodies*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to the physical body's cycle of birth and death.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Contrasts the transient nature of the body with the eternal Self.

5. **घटादिषु वियदिव (ghaṭādiṣu viyad iva)**: *Like space in pots, etc.*

   - **Explanation**: An analogy where space remains unchanged despite the creation or destruction of pots.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Illustrates the unchanging nature of the Self amidst changing forms.

6. **देहभेद (deha-bheda)**: *Differences of bodies*

   - **Explanation**: The variety of physical forms that beings assume.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Indicates that plurality is an illusion based on bodily distinctions.

7. **आत्मस्वरूप (ātma-svarūpa)**: *Essential nature of the Self*

   - **Explanation**: The true, unchanging essence beyond physical existence.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Central to the realization that the Self is eternal and indivisible.

8. **बहुवचन (bahuvacana)**: *Plural number*

   - **Explanation**: Use of plural forms in language.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Indicates the apparent multiplicity due to bodily differences, not actual division of the Self.

### **Dialectical Analysis**

#### **1. Questioning the Reason for Grief**

Śaṅkara begins by posing a rhetorical question: Why should Arjuna consider these beings as not to be grieved for? The answer lies in their eternal nature (*nityāḥ*).

#### **2. Affirmation of Eternal Existence**

- **Eternal Presence of the Self**:

  - **Past**: "There was never a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings."
    - The Self has always existed, even during past cycles of birth and death.

  - **Present and Future**: "Nor will there ever be a time when we cease to exist."
    - The Self will continue to exist eternally into the future.

- **Analogy of Space and Pots**:

  - Just as space within a pot remains unchanged despite the pot's creation or destruction, the Self remains constant despite changes in the body.
  - **Implication**: Physical forms may come and go, but the underlying reality remains unaffected.

#### **3. Understanding Plurality and Unity**

- **Use of Plurality**:

  - The plural form is used due to the continuation of bodily differences (*deha-bheda*), not because the Self is actually multiple.
  - **Key Point**: The apparent multiplicity is a result of identifying with the body, not the true nature of the Self.

- **Essential Unity of the Self**:

  - In essence, the Self is one and indivisible (*ātma-svarūpa*).
  - Recognizing this unity dispels the illusion of separation and the consequent sorrow.

#### **4. Conclusion on the Nature of Reality**

- **Transcending Time**:

  - The Self is beyond the limitations of past, present, and future.
  - **Timeless Existence**: The Self is unchanging across all three periods of time.

- **Implications for Grief**:

  - Since the true Self is eternal and unchanging, grieving over the death or destruction of bodies is misguided.
  - **Message to Arjuna**: Understanding the eternal nature of the Self should alleviate his sorrow.

### **Philosophical Implications**

#### **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Non-Duality of the Self**:

  - The Self (*Ātman*) is non-dual and the same in all beings.
  - Apparent differences are due to ignorance and identification with the body.

- **Illusion of Separateness**:

  - The perception of individual selves is an illusion created by the ego and attachment to physical forms.

- **Eternal Nature of Reality**:

  - Ultimate reality is unchanging, eternal, and beyond physical manifestations.

#### **Understanding of Time**

- **Transcending Temporal Limitations**:

  - The Self is not confined by time; it exists perpetually.
  - **Implication**: Concerns about birth and death pertain only to the body, not the Self.

---

### **Application to Spiritual Practice**

- **Cultivating Self-Knowledge**:

  - Seek to understand and realize the eternal nature of the Self.
  - **Practice**: Meditation and self-inquiry to transcend identification with the body.

- **Overcoming Attachment**:

  - Recognize that attachment to physical forms leads to sorrow.
  - **Detachment**: Develop dispassion towards transient phenomena.

- **Embracing Unity**:

  - See oneself in all beings and all beings in oneself.
  - **Compassion**: Foster universal love grounded in the awareness of oneness.

## **III. Summary**

In verse 2.12 of the Bhagavad Gītā, Lord Krishna imparts a profound teaching on the eternal nature of the Self to dispel Arjuna's grief. Śaṅkara's commentary elucidates this by emphasizing that the Self is unchanging and ever-present across past, present, and future. The distinctions we perceive are due to bodily differences, but at the level of the Self, there is no plurality.

Understanding this unity and eternal existence of the Self removes the basis for sorrow and delusion. By recognizing that neither Arjuna nor his relatives truly cease to exist, Krishna guides Arjuna toward a higher perspective beyond the transient physical world.

## **IV. Next Steps**

- **Deepen Study**:

  - Continue exploring subsequent verses to build upon this foundational understanding.
  - Reflect on the analogies used, such as space in pots, to internalize the teachings.

- **Practical Integration**:

  - Apply the insights to daily life by practicing detachment and fostering a sense of unity with all beings.
  - Engage in self-inquiry to directly experience the eternal nature of the Self.
