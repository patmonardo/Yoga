## Verse Presentation

ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा कूटस्थो विजितेन्द्रियः ।
युक्त इत्युच्यते योगी समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः ॥ ८ ॥

### Translation (English)

"The yogi who is fully satisfied with knowledge (jñāna) and realization (vijñāna), who is unwavering (kūṭastha) and has conquered the senses, is said to be integrated (yukta). Such a person views a clod of earth, a stone, and gold as equal."

## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा ज्ञानं शास्त्रोक्तपदार्थानां परिज्ञानम्, विज्ञानं तु शास्त्रतो ज्ञातानां तथैव स्वानुभवकरणम्, ताभ्यां ज्ञानविज्ञानाभ्यां तृप्तः सञ्जातालंप्रत्ययः आत्मा अन्तःकरणं यस्य सः ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा, कूटस्थः अप्रकम्प्यः भवति इत्यर्थः; विजितेन्द्रियश्च । य ईदृशः, युक्तः समाहितः इति स उच्यते कथ्यते । स योगी समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः, लोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनानि समानि यस्य सः समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः ॥ ८ ॥

### Transliteration (IAST)

jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā—jñānaṃ śāstroktapadārthānāṃ parijñānam, vijñānaṃ tu śāstrato jñātānāṃ tathaiva svānubhava-karaṇam, tābhyāṃ jñāna-vijñānābhyāṃ tṛptaḥ sañjāta-alaṃpratyayaḥ ātmā antaḥkaraṇaṃ yasya saḥ jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā, kūṭasthaḥ aprakampyaḥ bhavati ity arthaḥ; vijitendriyaś ca.
ya īdṛśaḥ, yuktaḥ samāhitaḥ iti sa ucyate kathyate. sa yogī sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ, loṣṭāśma-kāñcanāni samāni yasya saḥ sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ. ॥8॥

### English Rendering of the Commentary

"‘Jñāna’ is the understanding of the entities taught by the scriptures. ‘Vijñāna’ is making what is known from the scriptures into direct personal experience. The one whose internal organ (antaḥkaraṇa) is fully satisfied with both knowledge and realization—who has thus developed a sense of having had enough (sañjāta-alaṃpratyayaḥ)—is called jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā. Such a person becomes kūṭastha, meaning unwavering, and has also conquered the senses.

One who is like this is said to be ‘yukta’ (integrated, concentrated). Such a yogi sees the same value in a clod of earth, a stone, and gold—thus called sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ."

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Jñāna (ज्ञान):** Scriptural knowledge, intellectual understanding of metaphysical truths.
   - **Vijñāna (विज्ञान):** Direct, personal realization or experiential understanding that complements and perfects intellectual knowledge.
   - **Tṛptātmā (तृप्तात्मा):** One whose mind (antaḥkaraṇa) is fully satisfied, having no further cravings for external supports.
   - **Kūṭastha (कूटस्थ):** Unwavering, unshakable—like a mountain peak (kūṭa) that does not move.
   - **Vijitendriya (विजितेन्द्रिय):** Conqueror of the senses, one who has full mastery over sensory impulses.
   - **Sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcana (सम-लोष्टाश्म-काञ्चन):** Viewing a clod of earth, a stone, and gold as equal, symbolizing complete detachment from material valuations.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - The verse builds on previous teachings of self-mastery and equanimity. Now it highlights a state where knowledge and realization culminate in unwavering peace and indifference to material distinctions.
   - Śaṅkara underscores the movement from scriptural understanding (jñāna) to direct realization (vijñāna), which leads to complete inner satisfaction and stability.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - Previous verses explained the path: renouncing desires, mastering the mind and senses, achieving equanimity, and realizing the Supreme Self. This verse now describes the final refinement: not just mental peace, but fullness in knowledge and realization, resulting in total steadiness.
   - The equality of clod, stone, and gold epitomizes the transcending of worldly dualities and attachments.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **From Mere Knowledge to Moral Realization:**
  Kant distinguishes between theoretical knowledge and the moral law that must be internalized. Similarly, the Gītā distinguishes between intellectual understanding (jñāna) and lived experience (vijñāna). The fully satisfied mind echoes Kant’s ideal agent who not only knows the moral law but embodies it, acting from duty without inclination.

### Fichtean Development

- **Self-Positing I and Experiential Insight:**
  Fichte emphasizes that the self must go beyond theoretical constructs to truly realize freedom. Similarly, the shift from jñāna to vijñāna parallels moving from intellectual abstraction to lived, self-evident truth. Once the self internalizes this truth, it stands unwavering, unaffected by external objects or values, akin to Fichte’s I actualizing its freedom through pure self-activity.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Dialectical Unity of Knowledge and Being:**
  For Hegel, knowing and being must unite. The progression from jñāna (intellectual knowledge) to vijñāna (experiential realization) is a Hegelian synthesis, overcoming the gap between theory and lived reality. The final state where stone, earth, and gold are seen equally signifies a consciousness that has transcended finite valuations in a universal, absolute perspective.

- **Concrete Universality:**
  Hegel would view this stage as the attainment of a concrete universal: the yogi does not just understand universal truths abstractly; they live them, making all objects equal manifestations of the same underlying reality. Thus, the yogi achieves a stable, rational unity that no partial perspective can disturb.

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the verse describes a yogi’s complete satisfaction in knowledge and realization, unwavering concentration, and indifference to material values. Philosophically, this resonates with the transition from theoretical understanding to practical wisdom, autonomy, and rational equanimity highlighted by Kant, Fichte, and Hegel.

- **Continuity in the Gītā’s Message:**
  The Gītā’s spiritual evolution proceeds from preliminary discipline (karmayoga), through mental control and renunciation, toward stable meditation and Self-realization. Now, the incorporation of knowledge and direct experience leads to a state where the yogi transcends material distinctions and stabilizes in absolute equanimity.

---

**In conclusion, Bhagavad Gītā 6.8 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary depict the yogi who has fully integrated scriptural knowledge with personal realization, achieving unwavering steadiness and treating all material objects with equal regard. Philosophically, this state aligns with Kant’s moral embodiment, Fichte’s realized freedom, and Hegel’s reconciliation of knowledge and reality, illustrating a deeply rational and universal spiritual fulfillment.**
