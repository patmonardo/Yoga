### Translation (English)

**The Blessed Lord said:**
"Understand, O Pāṇḍava, that what is called ‘renunciation’ (saṃnyāsa) is also ‘yoga.’ For no one becomes a yogī without having renounced all intention (saṅkalpa) [toward the fruits of action]."

## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

नु च निरग्नेः अक्रियस्यैव श्रुतिस्मृतियोगशास्त्रेषु संन्यासित्वं योगित्वं च प्रसिद्धम् । कथम् इह साग्नेः सक्रियस्य च संन्यासित्वं योगित्वं च अप्रसिद्धमुच्यते इति । नैष दोषः, कयाचित् गुणवृत्त्या उभयस्य सम्पिपादयिषितत्वात् ।
तत् कथम् ? कर्मफलसङ्कल्पसंन्यासात् संन्यासित्वम्, योगाङ्गत्वेन च कर्मानुष्ठानात् कर्मफलसङ्कल्पस्य च चित्तविक्षेपहेतोः परित्यागात् योगित्वं च इति गौणमुभयम्; न पुनः मुख्यं संन्यासित्वं योगित्वं च अभिप्रेतम् ।
इत्येतमर्थं दर्शयितुमाह —
यं संन्यासमिति प्राहुः योगं तं विद्धि पाण्डव ।
न ह्यसंन्यस्तसङ्कल्पो योगी भवति कश्चन ॥ २ ॥
यं सर्वकर्मतत्फलपरित्यागलक्षणं परमार्थसंन्यासं ‘संन्यासम्’ इति प्राहुः श्रुतिस्मृतिविदः, ‘योगं’ कर्मानुष्ठानलक्षणं तं परमार्थसंन्यासं विद्धि जानीहि हे पाण्डव ।
कर्मयोगस्य प्रवृत्तिलक्षणस्य तद्विपरीतेन निवृत्तिलक्षणेन परमार्थसंन्यासेन कीदृशं सामान्यमङ्गीकृत्य तद्भाव उच्यते इत्यपेक्षायामिदमुच्यते — अस्ति हि परमार्थसंन्यासेन सादृश्यं कर्तृद्वारकं कर्मयोगस्य ।
यो हि परमार्थसंन्यासी स त्यक्तसर्वकर्मसाधनतया सर्वकर्मतत्फलविषयं सङ्कल्पं प्रवृत्तिहेतुकामकारणं संन्यस्यति । अयमपि कर्मयोगी कर्म कुर्वाण एव फलविषयं सङ्कल्पं संन्यस्यति इत्येतमर्थं दर्शयिष्यन् आह —
न हि यस्मात् असंन्यस्तसङ्कल्पः असंन्यस्तः अपरित्यक्तः फलविषयः सङ्कल्पः अभिसन्धिः येन सः असंन्यस्तसङ्कल्पः कश्चन कश्चिदपि कर्मी योगी समाधानवान् भवति न सम्भवतीत्यर्थः, फलसङ्कल्पस्य चित्तविक्षेपहेतुत्वात् ।
तस्मात् यः कश्चन कर्मी संन्यस्तफलसङ्कल्पो भवेत् स योगी समाधानवान् अविक्षिप्तचित्तो भवेत्, चित्तविक्षेपहेतोः फलसङ्कल्पस्य संन्यस्तत्वादित्यभिप्रायः ॥ २ ॥

### Translation (English)

[Contextual, Integrated Translation]

Someone might object: "It is well known from the Upaniṣads, Smṛti, and Yoga scriptures that a person who has given up fires (niragni) and actions (akriya) is renowned as a saṃnyāsī and yogī. How then can it be said here that one who still maintains fires and engages in actions can also be considered a saṃnyāsī and yogī, where this seems unprecedented?"

There is no fault in this. Because here, through a certain figurative sense (gauṇa), both saṃnyāsitva (being a renunciant) and yogitva (being a yogi) are being ascribed. How so? By renouncing the intention (saṅkalpa) for fruits of action, one attains a kind of saṃnyāsitva; and by performing actions as a part of the means to yoga while giving up fruit-oriented intentions (which cause mental distraction), one attains a kind of yogitva. Both are gauṇa (secondary or figurative), not the primary meaning of saṃnyāsitva and yogitva.

To show this, the verse says: "Know that which they call ‘saṃnyāsa’ is also ‘yoga,’ O Pāṇḍava. For no one becomes a yogi who has not renounced intention (saṅkalpa)."

Those versed in the scriptures say that what is called paramārtha-saṃnyāsa (ultimate renunciation) involves giving up all actions and their fruits. Understand that same highest renunciation, here described as yoga characterized by the performance of action, O Pāṇḍava.

How so? Karmayoga, which involves engagement in action, is in some respect analogous to the paramārtha-saṃnyāsa that involves ceasing action entirely. The paramārtha-saṃnyāsin renounces all fruit-oriented intentions—the very cause of activity driven by desire. Similarly, the karmayogī, while still engaged in action, renounces the intention for fruits. Thus, when the verse says "no one becomes a yogī without having renounced saṅkalpa," it means that the karmayogī must also abandon fruit-desires that agitate the mind.

Hence, anyone who performs actions but has relinquished the fruit-oriented intention becomes a yogī with a composed and undistracted mind, since the root cause of mental scattering, the fruit-desire, has been abandoned. That is the implication here.

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms and Concepts:**
   - **Niragni/Akriya Saṃnyāsī:** Traditionally, a renunciant who has given up the sacrificial fires and external actions is considered a true saṃnyāsī.
   - **Gauṇa (Secondary) Saṃnyāsitva and Yogitva:** Śaṅkara clarifies that calling a householder performing dutiful action (but free from fruit-desires) a saṃnyāsī and yogī is a figurative or secondary usage. The text is drawing an analogy rather than claiming equivalence with the highest renunciate state.
   - **Saṅkalpa:** The intention or resolve, here specifically referring to the desire for the fruits of one’s actions. Its renunciation is central to achieving a steady mind.
   - **Paramārtha-Saṃnyāsa:** Ultimate renunciation where one gives up all actions and their fruits. This is the primary sense of saṃnyāsa.
   - **Karmayoga:** The path of action performed without attachment to results, serving as a stepping-stone towards steadiness of mind and eventually pure meditation.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - Śaṅkara responds to a potential objection about the unusual usage of “saṃnyāsī” and “yogī” for a person engaged in action.
   - He distinguishes between the primary, ultimate sense of saṃnyāsa (giving up all actions) and a secondary sense ascribed to a karmayogī (giving up fruit-desires while still acting).
   - The verse (6.2) serves as a doctrinal pivot: it links the concept of saṃnyāsa directly to the renunciation of fruit-intention, showing how karmayoga shares a functional similarity with ultimate renunciation.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - This passage builds on the previous verse and commentary, further clarifying that mental renunciation is key.
   - It reinforces that karmayoga is not a watered-down spirituality. Instead, it is a crucial preliminary stage that mirrors the essence of true renunciation by eliminating fruit-desires.
   - It prepares the ground for understanding that dhyāna (meditation) and yoga require a stable, distraction-free mind, which comes from relinquishing fruit-oriented intentions.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Moral Intention over External Conditions:** Kant emphasizes acting from duty rather than inclination. Similarly, here, the value is placed not on whether one performs external rites or has renounced them, but on whether one has renounced the desire for fruits. The universal principle that makes one a yogī and a saṃnyāsī in a secondary sense is an internal condition—akin to acting from pure rational duty in Kantian ethics.
- **Condition of Possibility:** The possibility of becoming a true yogī hinges on the internal condition (renunciation of saṅkalpa) rather than on outward ashrama status or rituals.

### Fichtean Development

- **Self-Positing and the Role of Intention:** For Fichte, freedom and moral life require that the self transcend mere inclinations. By renouncing fruit-oriented intentions, the karmayogī asserts their rational self, freeing themselves from external heteronomy. This parallels the I’s elevation in Fichtean philosophy.
- **Dialectical Movement:** The text shows a dialectic: ultimate renunciation (no action) is primary (paramārtha), but the karmayogī approximates it by the internal principle of giving up fruit-desires. This is a transitional stage where the self overcomes attachment step by step.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Synthesizing Opposites:** Hegel’s dialectic would see paramārtha-saṃnyāsa (no action) and karmayoga (continued action) as antithetical. Yet the renunciation of fruit-desire unites them on a higher conceptual level. The internal principle of renunciation bridges the gulf between action and non-action.
- **Concrete Universality:** By showing that what is called saṃnyāsa is also yoga, the text universalizes the principle of renunciation. Whether acting or not, one who lets go of fruit-oriented intentions partakes in the universal ideal that defines genuine spiritual practice.

---

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the commentary clarifies that the Gītā uses figurative language to praise the karmayogī as a saṃnyāsī and yogī. Philosophically, this means internal renunciation and mental purity define the true essence of yogic renunciation, resonating with principles of moral autonomy (Kant), self-transcendence (Fichte), and dialectical synthesis (Hegel).

- **Continuity of Thought:**
  Previously, we saw that performing duty without relying on fruits grants a certain status akin to renunciation and yoga. Now, this verse explicitly connects the conceptual frameworks of saṃnyāsa and yoga, emphasizing that abandoning fruit-desires is the fundamental criterion. This sets a strong foundation for the journey into deeper meditation (dhyāna) and advanced spiritual states.

---

**In conclusion, Bhagavad Gītā 6.2 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary clarify that the internal renunciation of fruit-desires (saṅkalpa) is the critical factor that bestows figurative saṃnyāsa and yogitva. While traditional saṃnyāsa involves renouncing all action, the karmayogī achieves a functional equivalence through pure intention. Philosophically, this aligns with Kantian moral purity of motive, Fichtean self-determination beyond inclination, and Hegelian dialectical unity, illustrating a profound and rational pathway to spiritual integration.**
