## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

आत्मैव बन्धुः आत्मैव रिपुः आत्मनः इत्युक्तम् । तत्र किंलक्षण आत्मा आत्मनो बन्धुः, किंलक्षणो वा आत्मा आत्मनो रिपुः इत्युच्यते —

बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जितः ।
अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्तेतात्मैव शत्रुवत् ॥ ६ ॥

बन्धुः आत्मा आत्मनः तस्य, तस्य आत्मनः स आत्मा बन्धुः येन आत्मना आत्मैव जितः, आत्मा कार्यकरणसङ्घातो येन वशीकृतः, जितेन्द्रिय इत्यर्थः ।
अनात्मनस्तु अजितात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे शत्रुभावे वर्तेत आत्मैव शत्रुवत्, यथा अनात्मा शत्रुः आत्मनः अपकारी, तथा आत्मा आत्मन अपकारे वर्तेत इत्यर्थः ॥ ६ ॥

### English Rendering of the Commentary

It was stated that the self is both friend and enemy of oneself. Now, what kind of self is considered a friend of oneself, and what kind of self is considered one’s enemy?

"For him whose self has been conquered by the self, that self is indeed a friend of himself. But for one who has not conquered himself, that same self acts with enmity, like an enemy."

Here, ‘friend’ means the self is supportive when one has control over oneself. The word ‘ātmā’ here refers to the complex of body and senses, which has been brought under control by the higher self. Such a person is called ‘jitendriya’ (one who has conquered the senses).

Conversely, for one who is not self-controlled (anātmā, ajitātmā), the self behaves like an enemy, just as an external foe would cause harm. Similarly, the uncontrolled self harms its own interests.

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Ātmā (आत्मा):** Here it refers not only to the pure Self but also to the psycho-physical complex (body–mind–senses) that can be mastered or left unrestrained.
   - **Bandhuḥ (बन्धुः):** Friend, meaning a supportive ally aiding in spiritual progress.
   - **Ripuḥ (रिपुः):** Enemy, an opposing force detrimental to one’s spiritual well-being.
   - **Jitendriya (जितेन्द्रिय):** One who has conquered the senses, exercising mastery over sense impulses and desires.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - The verse distinguishes two conditions of the self:
     - Mastered self: One who has disciplined their psycho-physical apparatus is aided by their own self.
     - Unmastered self: One who fails to control their senses and mind finds their own self acting as a saboteur.
   - This continues the emphasis on self-responsibility and internal governance from previous verses.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - Earlier verses stressed the need for internal renunciation and self-uplift. Here, the Gītā makes explicit the conditions that make the self a friend (control) or an enemy (lack of control).
   - This sets a clearer standard for the aspirant: conquering oneself through discipline and detachment transforms the self from a hindrance into a supportive ally on the spiritual path.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Moral Autonomy and Self-Discipline:**
  Kant values rational self-control as the hallmark of moral personhood. Similarly, here the self becomes a friend only when governed by reason and disciplined will. Without mastery, the self leads to moral and spiritual downfall, analogous to failing to act from duty and succumbing to inclination in Kantian ethics.

### Fichtean Development

- **Self-Positing I and Overcoming Internal Obstacles:**
  For Fichte, the I must assert itself and overcome internal constraints. If the I fails to master its internal drives, it undermines its own autonomy. The notion that the uncontrolled self is an enemy aligns with Fichte’s emphasis on the self’s need to transcend lower drives and positively shape its own destiny.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Dialectical Unity of Self and Condition:**
  Hegel sees freedom attained through the reconciliation of internal contradictions. Initially, the self might be at odds with itself, driven by conflicting impulses. Through discipline, these conflicts sublate into a harmonious unity, making the self its own ally. The enemy–friend dichotomy is resolved as the self internalizes reason and transcends lower impulses, reaching a higher universal standpoint.

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the verse points out the condition for one’s self being a helper or a foe: self-mastery. Philosophically, it parallels the idea that true freedom and rational autonomy come from internal discipline. Without internal governance, no external help suffices, and the self degenerates into a destructive force.

- **Continuity of the Teaching:**
  Previous verses set the stage by emphasizing self-reliance and the need for internal purification (giving up desires, intentions, etc.). Now, the Gītā clarifies the nature of one’s internal agent. This internal agent can either be harnessed for liberation or left untamed, leading to bondage. The message is consistent: to progress spiritually, one must cultivate a disciplined inner life.

---

**In conclusion, Bhagavad Gītā 6.6 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary clarify the conditions under which the self serves as friend or enemy. By conquering one’s mind and senses (jitendriya), the self becomes supportive of spiritual aims. If neglected, it becomes a hindrance. Philosophically, this echoes Kant’s moral autonomy, Fichte’s self-assertion against internal obstacles, and Hegel’s dialectical synthesis of lower impulses into a higher rational unity—all emphasizing that true freedom and moral-spiritual growth spring from self-mastery.**
