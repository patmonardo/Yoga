## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

यदा एवं योगारूढः, तदा तेन आत्मा उद्धृतो भवति संसारादनर्थजातात् । अतः —
उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत् ।
आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः ॥ ५ ॥

उद्धरेत् संसारसागरे निमग्नम् आत्मना आत्मानं ततः उत् ऊर्ध्वं हरेत् उद्धरेत्, योगारूढतामापादयेदित्यर्थः । न आत्मानम् अवसादयेत् न अधो नयेत्, न अधो गमयेत् ।
आत्मैव हि यस्मात् आत्मनः बन्धुः । न हि अन्यः कश्चित् बन्धुः यः संसारमुक्तये भवति । बन्धुरपि तावत् मोक्षं प्रति प्रतिकूल एव, स्नेहादिबन्धनायतनत्वात् । तस्मात् युक्तमवधारणम् ‘आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुः’ इति ।
आत्मैव रिपुः शत्रुः । यः अन्यः अपकारी बाह्यः शत्रुः सोऽपि आत्मप्रयुक्त एवेति युक्तमेव अवधारणम् ‘आत्मैव रिपुरात्मनः’ इति ॥ ५ ॥

### English Rendering of the Commentary

"When one is thus established in yoga (yogārūḍha), the self is indeed uplifted from the host of worldly evils. Therefore, (the verse says):

‘One should elevate oneself by oneself; one should not lower oneself. For the self alone is the friend of oneself, and the self alone is the enemy of oneself.’

‘Uddharet’ means one should raise oneself, who is submerged in the ocean of worldly existence, by oneself—meaning, lead oneself upwards to attain yogārūḍhatā (the state of being established in yoga). One should not degrade oneself, not lead oneself downwards.

The self alone is indeed one’s friend. There is no other friend who can lead one out of worldly existence. Even a so-called friend is actually unfavorable to liberation, as it becomes a source of attachment (sneha) and bondage. Thus, it is rightly stated that ‘the self alone is one’s friend.’

Likewise, the self alone is also one’s enemy. Any external enemy who does harm is also ultimately enabled by oneself. Therefore, it is properly affirmed that ‘the self alone is one’s enemy.’"

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Uddharet (उद्धरेत्):** To raise, lift up. Here, it means to elevate one’s own self from the mire of worldly suffering (saṃsāra) through spiritual practice and discipline.
   - **Ātmā (आत्मा):** The self. In this context, it includes the internal agent capable of self-improvement or self-destruction.
   - **Bandhuḥ (बन्धुः):** Friend. Here, it means a true ally in the quest for liberation.
   - **Ripuḥ (रिपुः):** Enemy. An internal ‘enemy’ corresponds to negative tendencies or ignorance that cause harm.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - The verse instructs self-reliance: no external entity can free one from saṃsāra. The responsibility for one’s spiritual elevation or downfall rests with oneself.
   - Śaṅkara clarifies that external friends or enemies are ultimately mediated by oneself. Attachments that hinder liberation can come from what we perceive as friendships. Similarly, enemies operate through our own choices and weaknesses.
   - This teaching emphasizes self-agency and personal accountability.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - In previous verses, we saw the importance of preparing for meditation through karmayoga and renouncing desires. Now, the text focuses on the individual’s role in raising oneself to higher states.
   - By highlighting self as both friend and enemy, the Gītā underscores the internal locus of control crucial for advancing on the spiritual path.

4. **Compound Analysis:**
   - **Ātmanātmānaṃ (आत्मनात्मानम्):** The reflexive construction indicates that the self must raise itself by its own means, stressing autonomy and internal effort.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Moral Autonomy and Self-Responsibility:**
  Kant stresses autonomy: the rational agent alone determines moral worth. This verse aligns with the idea that no external factor can guarantee liberation; the individual’s rational will must choose the path of elevation. Much like Kant’s moral law within, here the inner self is the sole responsible agent for spiritual ascent or descent.

### Fichtean Development

- **Self-Positing I and Self-Overcoming:**
  For Fichte, the I is both the source of error and the agent of its own liberation. The self posits obstacles and must overcome them, evolving through self-generated challenges. The verse resonates with the Fichtean notion that the I must actively lift itself from limitation, not blaming external conditions. The I’s friend or foe is always its own activity or inertia.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Dialectical Unity of Opposites:**
  Hegel finds meaning in the recognition that friend and enemy are not absolute categories ‘out there’ but are reconciled in the self. The self synthesizes these contradictions—ally and adversary—within its own being. By internalizing both friend and enemy, the individual can transcend opposites. Ultimately, this leads to a more universal perspective where the self’s rational nature orchestrates its liberation.

- **Absolute Self-Determination:**
  Hegel would see this as the self’s journey toward absolute freedom. Realizing that all conditions (friendship, enmity) are rooted in the self’s posture toward reality, the practitioner can transcend contingent dualities, moving toward a state of integrated self-conscious rational freedom.

---

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the verse instructs self-elevation. Philosophically, it asserts radical self-determination. The practitioner must rely on their own efforts and discernment, free from reliance on external aids, reflecting a maturation of spiritual autonomy.

- **Continuity in the Narrative:**
  After learning how to become established in yoga (previous verses), this verse instructs the now yogically inclined individual to recognize personal responsibility. Elevation is not handed down; it must be self-generated. This step ensures the internalization of principles discussed in earlier verses—renunciation, detachment, and stable meditation—are now understood as under the individual’s own control.

---

**In conclusion, Bhagavad Gītā 6.5 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary emphasize personal responsibility and self-reliance on the spiritual path. The self is shown to be the ultimate agent determining liberation or bondage, friend or foe. Philosophically, this aligns with Kant’s moral autonomy, Fichte’s self-positing freedom, and Hegel’s dialectical self-integration, all affirming that true spiritual elevation is orchestrated by the internal rational agent—oneself.**
