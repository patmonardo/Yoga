## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

अथेदानीं कदा योगारूढो भवति इत्युच्यते —
यदा हि नेन्द्रियार्थेषु न कर्मस्वनुषज्जते ।
सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी योगारूढस्तदोच्यते ॥ ४ ॥

यदा समाधीयमानचित्तो योगी हि इन्द्रियार्थेषु (इन्द्रियाणामर्थाः शब्दादयः) तेषु इन्द्रियार्थेषु, कर्मसु च नित्यनैमित्तिककाम्यप्रतिषिद्धेषु प्रयोजनाभावबुद्ध्या न अनुषज्जते — अनुषङ्गं कर्तव्यताबुद्धिं न करोतीत्यर्थः ।
सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी सर्वान् सङ्कल्पान् इहामुत्रार्थकामहेतून् संन्यसितुं शीलम् अस्य इति सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी, योगारूढः प्राप्तयोग इत्येतत्, तदा तस्मिन् काले उच्यते । ‘सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी’ इति वचनात् सर्वांश्च कामान् सर्वाणि च कर्माणि संन्यस्येत्यर्थः ।
सङ्कल्पमूला हि सर्वे कामाः — ‘सङ्कल्पमूलः कामो वै यज्ञाः सङ्कल्पसम्भवाः’ (मनु. २ । ३) ‘काम जानामि ते मूलं सङ्कल्पात्किल जायसे, न त्वां सङ्कल्पयिष्यामि तेन मे न भविष्यसि’ (मो. ध. १७७ । २५) इत्यादिस्मृतेः । सर्वकामपरित्यागे च सर्वकर्मसंन्यासः सिद्धो भवति, ‘स यथाकामो भवति तत्क्रतुर्भवति, यत्क्रतुर्भवति तत्कर्म कुरुते’ (बृ. उ. ४ । ४ । ५) इत्यादिश्रुतिभ्यः ; ‘यद्यद्धि कुरुते जन्तुः तत्तत् कामस्य चेष्टितम्’ (मनु. २ । ४) इत्यादिस्मृतिभ्यश्च ; न्यायाच्च — न हि सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासे कश्चित् स्पन्दितुमपि शक्तः ।
तस्मात् ‘सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी’ इति वचनात् सर्वान् कामान् सर्वाणि कर्माणि च त्याजयति भगवान् ॥ ४ ॥

### Translation (English)

Now, when does one become established in yoga (yogārūḍha)? The verse explains:

"When the yogī, whose mind is becoming steady, does not cling to sense-objects (the objects of the senses such as sound, etc.) nor to actions (be they daily, occasional, desire-prompted, or prohibited), because he recognizes no necessity or personal gain in them; when he refrains from considering them as obligatory or binding — at that time, he is said to be not attached.

He is also called ‘sarvasaṅkalpasaṃnyāsī’ — one who has the habit of renouncing all intentions and desires (saṅkalpa) for gains here or hereafter. The moment he is free from all such saṅkalpas, he is said to be yogārūḍha, established in yoga.

Because he is termed a ‘renouncer of all saṅkalpas,’ this implies renunciation of all desires and all actions. Since all desires originate in saṅkalpa, as cited in scriptures (‘Desire arises from imagination/saṅkalpa,’ etc.), giving up all desires entails the cessation of all actions. The Upaniṣads and Smṛtis affirm that all actions are driven by desires, so by removing desires completely, actions naturally cease.

Thus, from the phrase ‘sarvasaṅkalpasaṃnyāsī,’ the Lord indirectly instructs the relinquishing of all desires and all actions."

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Indriyārtha (इन्द्रियार्थ):** Sense-objects (sound, touch, form, taste, smell) that feed the senses.
   - **Karma (कर्म):** Actions, including nitya (daily obligatory), naimittika (occasional), kāmya (desire-prompted), and pratiṣiddha (prohibited) actions.
   - **Saṅkalpa (सङ्कल्प):** An intention or mental resolve, especially tied to desire and the motivation for action.
   - **Sarvasaṅkalpasaṃnyāsī (सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी):** One who renounces all intentions, implying the cessation of both desires and their resultant actions.
   - **Yogārūḍha (योगारूढ):** Established or firmly rooted in yoga, stable in meditation, no longer distracted by worldly motives.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - The verse and commentary clarify when one transitions from aspiring to yoga (ārurukṣu) to being established in yoga (yogārūḍha).
   - The condition for being yogārūḍha is total freedom from attachment to sense-objects and actions, which arises from the renunciation of all saṅkalpa.
   - By showing that all desires and actions stem from saṅkalpa, Śaṅkara posits a chain: remove saṅkalpa → remove desire → remove unnecessary actions → attain stable meditation.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - Previous verses established karmayoga as a preliminary means. Now we learn the hallmark of having moved beyond that stage: no longer needing to engage in action or rely on external disciplines.
   - This verse completes the progression: once you have purified the mind through karmayoga, you must now drop even subtle intentions, desires, and actions to become firmly established in yoga.

4. **Cross-Referencing Scriptural Authority:**
   - Śaṅkara cites Manu and Mokṣa Dharma, Upaniṣads (Bṛhadāraṇyaka), and logical reasoning to show the universal scriptural consensus that desires root all actions.
   - The commentary uses these sources to highlight that ultimate stability in yoga requires transcending even the subtlest mental motivations.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Independence from Empirical Motivations:**
  Kantian morality underscores acting from pure reason rather than desire. Here, the yogārūḍha condition parallels the Kantian sage who no longer acts from inclination (desire, saṅkalpa) but rests in pure rational freedom. When no desires remain, no contingent action is needed, and the will stands autonomous.

### Fichtean Development

- **Self-Conscious Freedom from Desire:**
  For Fichte, the ultimate freedom is the I’s independence from external determiners. Initially, the self acts to purify itself (karmayoga), but now, at yogārūḍha, the self no longer needs action driven by desire. The self has realized a pure inwardness, a stable autonomy, free from the push and pull of saṅkalpas.

- **Dialectical Overcoming:**
  The aspirant first overcomes attachment by disciplined action; then surpasses even those disciplined actions by removing saṅkalpa. This is a dialectical progression: from acting rightly to not needing action at all, a higher synthesis of freedom and stillness emerges.

### Hegelian Integration

- **From External Means to Pure Internal State:**
  Hegel’s dialectic would see action as a lower moment, required when desires still exist. As saṅkalpa (imaginative intention) is removed, one transcends both action and desire. The contradiction between need (for action) and the goal (stillness) is resolved in a higher unity: a state of pure being beyond desires and actions.

- **Concrete Universality and Absolute Freedom:**
  Hegel would appreciate that true stability in yoga is a universal state: free from particular desires and external motivations, the individual attains universality. This condition is not just absence of action, but a positive state of pure, stable consciousness (samādhi), reflecting absolute freedom and rational completeness.

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the verse sets a clear milestone: giving up attachment to sense-objects and actions arises from renouncing all intentions. Philosophically, this matches the quest for absolute freedom and rational purity, a hallmark of completion in both Indian and German Idealist thought.

- **Continuity and Progression:**
  We started from action without fruit-desire (verse 1), moved to the recognition that renouncing intentions leads toward yoga (verse 2–3). Now at verse 4, we see the culmination: true establishment in yoga demands total elimination of saṅkalpa, thereby dissolving all root causes of worldly engagement and mental agitation.

In sum, the practitioner now stands at the threshold of pure meditation, having no internal distractions. This ties neatly with the philosophical frameworks that value progression from heteronomy to autonomy (Kant), self-determination (Fichte), and realized conceptual unity (Hegel).

**Conclusion:**

Bhagavad Gītā 6.4 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary delineate the pinnacle of preparatory yoga practice: becoming yogārūḍha by renouncing all saṅkalpas (intentions), desires, and thereby all karma. This leads to a state free from both external sense-objects and internal motivations, achieving perfect inwardness for meditation. Philosophically, this resonates with Kant’s morally pure will, Fichte’s free self, and Hegel’s dialectical culmination, representing the highest rational freedom and spiritual realization.
