## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

‘सुहृत्’ इत्यादिश्लोकार्धम् एकं पदम् । सुहृत् इति प्रत्युपकारमनपेक्ष्य उपकर्ता, मित्रं स्नेहवान्, अरिः शत्रुः, उदासीनः न कस्यचित् पक्षं भजते, मध्यस्थः यो विरुद्धयोः उभयोः हितैषी, द्वेष्यः आत्मनः अप्रियः, बन्धुः सम्बन्धी इत्येतेषु साधुषु शास्त्रानुवर्तिषु अपि च पापेषु प्रतिषिद्धकारिषु सर्वेषु एतेषु समबुद्धिः ‘कः किङ्कर्मा’ इत्यव्यापृतबुद्धिरित्यर्थः । विशिष्यते, ‘विमुच्यते’ इति वा पाठान्तरम् । योगारूढानां सर्वेषाम् अयम् उत्तम इत्यर्थः ॥ ९ ॥

### Transliteration (IAST)

‘suhṛt’ ityādi-ślokārdham ekaṃ padam. suhṛt iti pratyupakāram anapekṣya upakartā, mitraṃ snehavān, ariḥ śatruḥ, udāsīnaḥ na kasyacit pakṣaṃ bhajate, madhyasthaḥ yo viruddhayoḥ ubhayoḥ hitaiṣī, dveṣyaḥ ātmanaḥ apriyaḥ, bandhuḥ sambandhī ity eteṣu sādhuṣu śāstrānuvartiṣu api ca pāpeṣu pratiṣiddhakāriṣu sarveṣu eteṣu samabuddhiḥ ‘kaḥ kiṃ karmā’ ity avyāpṛtabuddhiḥ ity arthaḥ. viśiṣyate, ‘vimucyate’ iti vā pāṭhāntaram. yogārūḍhānāṃ sarveṣām ayam uttama ity arthaḥ. ॥9॥

### English Rendering of the Commentary

The half-verse beginning with ‘suhṛt’ is considered as one unit. A ‘suhṛt’ is one who helps without expecting any return. A ‘mitra’ is a friend who shows affection. An ‘ari’ is an enemy. An ‘udāsīna’ is one who does not take anyone’s side. A ‘madhyastha’ is a well-wisher to both opposing parties. A ‘dveṣya’ is someone who is disliked. A ‘bandhu’ is a relative.

Among all these—whether they are righteous people who follow the scriptures (sādhu) or sinful ones who transgress them (pāpa)—a person who maintains an equal intelligence (samabuddhi), meaning one who does not get involved in judging who is doing what and why (‘kaḥ kiṃ karmā’ ity avyāpṛtabuddhiḥ), is considered superior (viśiṣyate). Another reading is ‘vimucyate’ (is freed). This indicates that among all those established in yoga (yogārūḍha), this state is the highest.

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Suhṛt (सुहृत्):** A benefactor who helps selflessly.
   - **Mitra (मित्र):** A friend, one who shows affection or goodwill.
   - **Ari (अरिः):** An enemy or adversary.
   - **Udāsīna (उदासीन):** One indifferent or neutral, not taking sides.
   - **Madhyastha (मध्यस्थ):** A mediator or impartial well-wisher to both sides.
   - **Dveṣya (द्वेष्य):** One who is disliked or hateful.
   - **Bandhu (बन्धुः):** A relative or kin.
   - **Sādhu (साधु):** Righteous, virtuous person following scriptural injunctions.
   - **Pāpa (पाप):** A sinful or unrighteous person who violates scriptural rules.
   - **Samabuddhiḥ (समबुद्धिः):** Equal-mindedness, not distinguishing based on personal preference or aversion, not concerned with judging others’ actions.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - The verse extends the theme of equanimity now into the social sphere. The yogi’s even-mindedness does not waver regardless of the type of person encountered.
   - Śaṅkara clarifies that samabuddhi here means not to get entangled in thinking "Who did what action and why?"—i.e., not to judge or react based on others’ attributes or deeds.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - Previous verses discussed equanimity in the face of sense-objects, pleasure-pain, honor-dishonor. Now the perspective widens to relationships and moral standing of others.
   - The teaching shows that the highest state involves equal-mindedness beyond personal gain, friend-enemy binaries, or moral judgments of others. This is consistent with progressing from self-mastery to universal impartiality.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Universal Respect for Persons:**
  Kant’s moral philosophy emphasizes respecting rational beings as ends in themselves. The samabuddhi shown here resembles a state of impartial respect—one does not judge or treat people differently based on personal feelings or prejudices. It’s akin to viewing all rational agents from a universal moral standpoint.

### Fichtean Development

- **Overcoming Partiality and External Determination:**
  Fichte’s I must assert itself free from external constraints. Here, the yogi’s impartiality suggests a self who does not let external social roles (friend, enemy, etc.) dictate internal peace or judgment. The self asserts independence from these relational conditions, standing firm in its moral-spiritual autonomy.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Dialectical Transcendence of Social Opposites:**
  Hegel would see these distinctions—friend vs. enemy, righteous vs. sinful—as particularities that the self ultimately transcends. By viewing all equally, the yogi reaches a universal perspective that integrates and rises above these oppositions. This universal standpoint aligns with Hegel’s ideal of a rational, all-encompassing viewpoint where no partial distinctions hold sway.

- **Concrete Universality:**
  Achieving samabuddhi with all types of people demonstrates reaching a universal consciousness. The self no longer identifies people by their contingent roles or moral standings but sees them under a unifying rational or spiritual lens.

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the verse asks the practitioner to remain equanimous toward various social relationships and moral categories. Philosophically, this points to a higher rational standpoint where personal preferences and moral judgments do not unsettle the practitioner’s peace.

- **Continuity in the Gītā’s Teaching:**
  The journey began with renouncing desires and mastering the mind. After stabilizing in inner peace and even-mindedness toward worldly conditions, the practitioner extends this equanimity to human relationships. This completion suggests the pinnacle of spiritual attainment: a state of universal goodwill, non-judgment, and deep internal freedom.

**In sum, Bhagavad Gītā 6.9 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary depict the yogi who achieves perfect impartiality toward all beings, whether friendly, hostile, righteous, or sinful. Philosophically, this resonates with Kant’s universal respect, Fichte’s self-determined freedom, and Hegel’s absolute standpoint of rational universality. Thus, the yogi attains the highest integration, free from partiality, judgment, or disturbance.**
