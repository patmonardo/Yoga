Below is the analysis for Bhagavad Gītā 6.7 along with Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary, following the previously established methodology. We will present the verse in Sanskrit, transliteration, and translation, then provide the commentary’s Sanskrit and transliteration, followed by a technical and philosophical analysis. Finally, we will integrate the Kant–Fichte–Hegel frameworks to offer a deeper philosophical perspective.

## Verse Presentation

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

जितात्मनः प्रशान्तस्य परमात्मा समाहितः ।
शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु तथा मानापमानयोः ॥ ७ ॥

### Transliteration (IAST)

jitātmanaḥ praśāntasya paramātmā samāhitaḥ |
śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkheṣu tathā mānāpamānayoḥ || 7 ||

### Translation (English)

"For one who has conquered oneself and is at peace, the Supreme Self (paramātmā) is perfectly established (realized). In the same way, (such a person remains balanced) amid cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as in honor and dishonor."

## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

जितात्मनः कार्यकरणसङ्घात आत्मा जितो येन सः जितात्मा तस्य जितात्मनः, प्रशान्तस्य प्रसन्नान्तःकरणस्य सतः संन्यासिनः परमात्मा समाहितः साक्षादात्मभावेन वर्तते इत्यर्थः । किञ्च शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु तथा माने अपमाने च मानापमानयोः पूजापरिभवयोः समः स्यात् ॥ ७ ॥

### Transliteration (IAST)

jitātmanaḥ kāryakaraṇa-saṅghāta ātmā jito yena saḥ jitātmā tasya jitātmanaḥ, praśāntasya prasannāntaḥkaraṇasya sataḥ saṃnyāsinaḥ paramātmā samāhitaḥ sākṣād ātmabhāvena vartate ity arthaḥ. kiñca śītoṣṇa-sukhaduḥkheṣu tathā māne apamāne ca mānāpamānayoḥ pūjā-paribhavayoḥ samaḥ syāt. ॥7॥

### English Rendering of the Commentary

"‘Jitātmanaḥ’ means one who has conquered the psycho-physical apparatus (the aggregate of body and senses). For such a person, who is at peace (praśānta) with a serene heart (prasannāntaḥkaraṇa) and who is a renunciant (saṃnyāsī), the Supreme Self (paramātmā) is directly realized. This means the Supreme Self is present as one’s very own Self (sākṣād ātmabhāva).

Furthermore, such a person remains equal in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as in honor and dishonor (mānāpamāna, which represent worship and insult respectively). In other words, one becomes the same in all these dualities."

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Jitātmā (जितात्मा):** One who has conquered their psycho-physical complex. This implies control over senses (indriyas), mind (manas), and the entire apparatus of action and perception.
   - **Praśānta (प्रशान्त):** Deeply peaceful, a state of inner tranquility and clarity.
   - **Paramātmā (परमात्मा):** The Supreme Self, often identified with Brahman or the ultimate reality. Realization of paramātmā means seeing the true nature of oneself as identical with the ultimate reality.
   - **Śītoṣṇa (शीतोष्ण), Sukha-Duḥkha (सुख-दुःख), Māna-Apamāna (मान-अपमान):** Pairs of opposites representing environmental conditions (cold-heat), subjective experiences (pleasure-pain), and social judgments (honor-dishonor).

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - The verse builds upon the previous instruction about self-mastery (verse 6). Once the self is conquered, one attains a stable peace that allows direct realization of the Supreme Self.
   - Śaṅkara clarifies that this realization is not abstract but a direct internal experience (sākṣād ātmabhāva).
   - The final line reiterates even-mindedness in all pairs of opposites, implying that self-realization culminates in perfect equanimity.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - In earlier verses, we learned the importance of renouncing fruit-desires and taming the mind. Here, the fruit of that effort is revealed: the direct realization of the paramātmā.
   - This verse shows the progression from disciplinary practices (karmayoga, renunciation of desires, conquering senses) to the attainment of steady peace and ultimate Self-realization.
   - Equanimity in all circumstances signals that the practitioner is no longer swayed by dualities, a hallmark of spiritual maturity.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Rational Autonomy and Equanimity:**
  For Kant, moral worth arises when one’s will aligns with rational duty rather than inclination. Here, the steady equanimity amid dualities mirrors a state where the individual acts from a rational principle unaffected by changing conditions. The realization of paramātmā is akin to reaching a rational moral ideal—complete freedom from external determinations.

### Fichtean Development

- **Self-Positing and Inner Freedom:**
  Fichte’s I must overcome external constraints to realize true freedom. Overcoming sensory conditions and social judgments aligns with the I’s journey to assert absolute independence. This stable state, where one realizes the Supreme Self, parallels the culminating point of Fichte’s philosophy where the I recognizes its own absolute grounding in the infinite.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Dialectical Resolution of Opposites:**
  Hegel’s dialectic finds resolution in higher syntheses. The practitioner here transcends the pairs of opposites—cold-heat, pleasure-pain, honor-dishonor—thus moving beyond the dualities that fragment ordinary consciousness. This integrative unity, where paramātmā is realized, is a perfect Hegelian synthesis: finite conditions dissolve into an absolute unity of Self-knowledge.

- **Absolute Knowing:**
  Realization of paramātmā can be seen as a form of Absolute Knowing in Hegel’s terms, where subject and object, the knower and the known, merge into a higher unity. The individual no longer identifies as a separate ego subject to conditions but as the universal Self, free from all contradictions.

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, the verse instructs that having conquered oneself, one attains peace and direct realization of the Supreme Self. Philosophically, this corresponds to an ideal of autonomy and self-comprehension beyond dualities.
  Kant’s rational freedom, Fichte’s self-asserting I, and Hegel’s dialectical resolution all resonate with this state of equanimous, self-realized consciousness.

- **Continuity in the Gītā’s Message:**
  The Gītā’s narrative has been guiding the practitioner from external discipline (karmayoga, renunciation of fruits) and internal purification (conquering the senses) toward the supreme goal of knowing oneself as the absolute reality (paramātmā). With self-control (verse 6), now the practitioner reaps the ultimate benefit (verse 7): stable realization, unaffected by worldly fluctuations.

**In conclusion, Bhagavad Gītā 6.7 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary present the culmination of self-mastery: realization of the Supreme Self and unwavering equanimity in all situations. Philosophically, this state harmonizes with Kant’s moral autonomy, Fichte’s inner freedom, and Hegel’s absolute synthesis, all pointing to a rational and universal dimension of spiritual fulfillment.**
