### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“For such a person, there is no purpose in action when he does not perform his duty, nor does he have any dependency on any purpose in all living beings.” (Gītā 3.18)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that action (karma) must be performed with a clear purpose aligned with one's duties (dharma). When a person does not perform their duty, their actions lack purpose (arthaḥ), rendering them futile. Moreover, such a person does not depend on any meaningful objective in their actions, leading to a life devoid of spiritual and moral direction. Therefore, performing duty with the right intention is essential for both personal well-being and the maintenance of cosmic order.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing actions with clear purpose aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty (dharma) rather than personal inclination or desire. According to Kant, actions must be performed out of a sense of duty and in accordance with universal moral laws. Śaṅkara reinforces this by highlighting that actions without purpose are futile and lack moral integrity, thereby resonating with Kant’s categorical imperative that moral actions should be universally applicable and devoid of selfish motives.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty with intention reflects Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By performing actions aligned with dharma, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action ensures that self-realization involves both intellectual comprehension and practical engagement, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that performing duty with clear purpose is not contradictory to the pursuit of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

In **Bhagavad Gītā Chapter 3, Verse 18**, Śaṅkara elucidates the futility of performing actions without clear purpose or alignment with one's duties (dharma). Technically, the verse establishes that actions devoid of meaningful intent are ineffective and lack moral and spiritual substance. Philosophically, this aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Purposeful Action:**
   - Actions must be performed with clear intent aligned with one's duties to be meaningful and effective.

2. **Moral Integrity:**
   - Performing duties without attachment to results ensures moral and spiritual integrity, avoiding futility and moral corruption.

3. **Universal Relevance:**
   - The principle of purposeful action applies universally, underscoring its foundational role in ethical and spiritual frameworks.

4. **Integration of Duty and Knowledge:**
   - Balancing duty (karma-yoga) with spiritual knowledge (jñāna) fosters holistic well-being and advancement towards liberation (mokṣa).

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through disciplined, selfless action (**karma**) performed with clear purpose and alignment with one's duties, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
