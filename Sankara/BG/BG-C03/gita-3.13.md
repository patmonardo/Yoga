### Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)

**Verse (Bhagavad Gītā 3.13)**

यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ।

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“But those who abandon all leftover portions of sacrifices and austerities, performing only the essential rites (yajñaśiṣṭāśinaḥ), and indulging in their desired enjoyments, are freed from all sins.
Such individuals, who destroy sin through their own actions and consume impure pleasures, are considered wicked and devoid of true purpose.” (Gītā 3.13)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that those who abandon the leftover portions of sacrifices and austerities—while maintaining only the essential sacrificial rites and engaging in desired pleasures—are freed from all kinds of sins. These yajñaśiṣṭāśinaḥ (those who partake in the residual portions of sacrifices) partake in impure pleasures like women, cattle, and other sensual enjoyments, which are increased and gratified through yajñas. Such individuals, by neglecting the true purpose of yajña and indulging in selfish desires, become corrupt and are considered wicked (aghāṃ pāpaṃ). They destroy their own purity and accumulate sins by engaging in actions driven by personal desires (ātmakāraṇāt), making them devoid of true purpose (ātmahetoḥ).

  Due to one's own actions or reasons.

- **Ātmahetoḥ (आत्महेतोः):**
  Devoid of true purpose or self-benefit.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Identification of Yajñaśiṣṭāśinaḥ:**
   - The verse begins by identifying those who abandon the residual portions of yajñas (sacrifices) and engage in desired pleasures.

2. **Consequences of Abandoning Residual Yajña:**
   - Such individuals are said to be freed from all sins, highlighting a superficial purification.

3. **Śaṅkara’s Critique:**
   - Śaṅkara explains that abandoning the essential purpose of yajña and indulging in selfish desires leads to moral corruption.

4. **Moral Judgment:**
   - Those who misuse yajña to gratify personal desires are labeled as impure and devoid of true purpose.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **Superficial Purification vs. True Purpose:**
   - While abandoning residual yajña may appear to purify an individual from sins, Śaṅkara argues that this act, when coupled with selfish indulgence, leads to moral decay.

2. **Misuse of Yajña:**
   - The intended purpose of yajña is to maintain cosmic and societal order, not to facilitate personal indulgence.

3. **Consequences of Misuse:**
   - Engaging in selfish pleasures under the guise of yajña results in the accumulation of sins and loss of true spiritual purpose.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Consistency with Earlier Verses:**
  - This verse builds upon previous teachings where the importance of performing duty (karma) without attachment is emphasized. Śaṅkara maintains that actions must align with their true spiritual purpose to avoid moral corruption.

- **Alignment with Vedic and Upaniṣadic Teachings:**
  - The emphasis on yajña as a means to maintain cosmic order and fulfill societal duties is consistent with Vedic and Upaniṣadic principles.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s critique of yajñaśiṣṭāśinaḥ aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing that actions must be performed out of duty and aligned with universal moral laws rather than personal inclinations. When individuals perform yajña with selfish desires, they deviate from their moral duty, leading to actions that are not universally acceptable and thus morally impermissible. Kant would argue that such actions undermine the integrity of moral duty, as they are driven by personal gain rather than adherence to universal ethical principles.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s analysis resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that performing yajña with true understanding and selflessness contributes to both personal and societal well-being. Conversely, performing yajña with selfish motives disrupts this harmony, leading to moral degradation. Fichte would advocate for actions that contribute to the self’s moral development and the betterment of society, aligning with Śaṅkara’s insistence on performing duties with proper intention.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the tension between performing yajña for spiritual purposes versus personal indulgence represents a dialectical conflict. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by asserting that yajña must be performed selflessly and without attachment to outcomes. This synthesis ensures that yajña serves its true purpose of maintaining cosmic and societal order, thus reconciling the individual’s duty with broader spiritual and moral objectives. Hegelian philosophy would view this as achieving a higher unity where action aligns with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary highlight the critical importance of performing yajña (sacrifices) with the right intention and understanding. Technically, Śaṅkara warns against the superficial practice of abandoning residual yajña while indulging in personal pleasures, which leads to moral corruption rather than spiritual liberation. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through genuine selfless action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by reconciling individual duty with universal moral principles.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **True Purpose of Yajña:**
  - Yajña is intended to maintain cosmic and societal order, not to facilitate personal indulgence.

- **Moral Integrity:**
  - Performing yajña with selfish motives leads to moral decay and accumulation of sins, undermining spiritual progress.

- **Integration of Duty and Intention:**
  - Actions must be performed with the right intention—selflessly and without attachment—to align with universal moral laws and achieve true liberation.

- **Philosophical Harmony:**
  - Ensuring that actions serve their intended spiritual and societal purposes fosters moral integrity and holistic development, consistent with Kantian, Fichtean, and Hegelian philosophies.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through disciplined, selfless action aligned with its true purpose, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
