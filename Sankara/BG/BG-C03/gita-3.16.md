```
य एवम् प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।
अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥ १६ ॥
देवान् इन्द्रादीन् भावयत वर्धयत अनेन यज्ञेन । ते देवा भावयन्तु आप्याययन्तु वृष्ट्यादिना वः युष्मान् । एवं परस्परम् अन्योन्यं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परं मोक्षलक्षणं ज्ञानप्राप्तिक्रमेण अवाप्स्यथ । स्वर्गं वा परं श्रेयः अवाप्स्यथ ॥ १६ ॥

**Commentary**
```
devān indrādīn bhāvayat vardhayat anena yajñena । te devā bhāvayantu āpyāyayantu vṛṣṭyādinā vaḥ yuṣmān । evaṃ parasparam anyonyaṃ bhāvayantaḥ śreyah paraṃ mokṣalakṣaṇam jñānaprāptikrameṇa avāpsyatha । svargaṃ vā paraṃ śreyah avāpsyatha ॥ 16 ॥

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“But he who does not follow this universal cycle of action in the world and who indulges in the enjoyment of the senses is considered impure and fruitless, O Partha (Arjuna).” (Gītā 3.16)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that those who abandon the prescribed cycle of yajña (sacrifice) and instead indulge solely in the pleasures of the senses are deemed impure and lead a fruitless life. By neglecting yajña, which sustains cosmic and societal order, and pursuing mere sensory enjoyment, individuals disrupt the harmony of the universe. Consequently, such individuals do not attain the ultimate goal of liberation (mokṣa) and instead remain entangled in the cycle of birth and death (samsāra). Thus, Śrī Bhagavān emphasizes the importance of adhering to yajña and performing one's duties selflessly to achieve both material prosperity and spiritual liberation.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on adhering to the cycle of action (yajña) aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty rather than personal inclinations or desires. By performing one's duties selflessly, individuals adhere to a universal moral law, ensuring that their actions are ethically consistent and devoid of selfish motives. Kant would argue that such duty-bound actions are essential for maintaining moral integrity and achieving a morally upright life, resonating with Śaṅkara’s teachings on the importance of performing yajña for ultimate well-being and liberation.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform yajña resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By performing yajña, individuals contribute to the greater good, fostering a sense of moral responsibility and self-improvement. This balance between inward knowledge and outward action ensures that self-realization involves both intellectual understanding and practical engagement, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (yajña) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

In this verse, Śaṅkara addresses the consequences of deviating from the prescribed cycle of action (pravartitaṃ cakraṃ) by indulging solely in sensory pleasures. Technically, he emphasizes that abandoning yajña leads to impurity (aghāyu) and a fruitless life (moghaṃ), undermining both material prosperity and spiritual advancement. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by highlighting the importance of duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through societal engagement, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual principles.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Importance of Adhering to Duty:**
   - Performing prescribed duties through yajña is essential for maintaining cosmic and societal harmony, ensuring both material and spiritual well-being.

2. **Consequences of Deviating from Yajña:**
   - Neglecting duties and indulging in sensory pleasures leads to impurity and a lack of meaningful achievement, hindering spiritual progress.

3. **Integration of Duty and Spirituality:**
   - Yajña serves as a means to integrate practical responsibilities with spiritual objectives, fostering a balanced and harmonious life.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - Ensuring that actions align with ethical duty and spiritual principles maintains moral integrity and facilitates holistic development, consistent with Kantian, Fichtean, and Hegelian philosophies.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through disciplined, selfless action (yajña) aligned with one's duties and devoid of selfish desires, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
