### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“Therefore, being detached, always perform your duty.
The man who acts without attachment attains the supreme goal.” (Gītā 3.19)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that one should perform their duties continuously and steadfastly, free from attachment and desires. By acting without attachment and dedicating actions to the divine will (īśvarārthaṃ), an individual purifies their soul (sattvaśuddhi) and attains the ultimate liberation (mokṣa). Thus, acting selflessly and without attachment leads to the highest spiritual fulfillment.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing duty without attachment aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an expression of the categorical imperative, where one acts according to maxims that can be universalized. Performing duty selflessly ensures that actions adhere to universal moral laws, promoting ethical consistency and integrity.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty with detachment resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By dedicating actions to the divine will, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Importance of Detachment in Action:**
   - Performing duties without attachment ensures selfless action, aligning personal responsibilities with cosmic order.

2. **Purification Through Selfless Action:**
   - Actions performed without personal desires purify the soul, preparing it for liberation.

3. **Attainment of Mokṣa:**
   - Consistent, detached action leads to mokṣa, freeing the individual from the cycle of birth and death.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The teaching aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating action with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Detachment:**
  - True fulfillment and spiritual liberation are achieved by performing one’s duties selflessly, without attachment to outcomes.

- **Moral and Spiritual Purification:**
  - Selfless action purifies the soul, making it capable of attaining mokṣa.

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - The teachings align with various philosophical frameworks, underscoring the universal relevance and depth of Śaṅkara’s exegesis.

- **Holistic Approach to Liberation:**
  - Combining disciplined action with detached engagement ensures a balanced path to both material prosperity and spiritual freedom.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
