### Translation (English)

**Verse**
**Śrī Bhagavān said:**
“O Arjuna, in this world, I have previously explained to the non-renunciates (trai-varṇikānāṃ) the twofold modes of existence: through knowledge (jñāna-yoga) for the sāṅkhya practitioners and through action (karma-yoga) for the yogis.” (Gītā 3.3)

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
Śaṅkara explains: In this world, for those committed to scriptural practices (śāstraarthānushiṭhānāṃ), particularly the three-fold caste groups (trai-varṇikānāṃ), there exist two distinct and dual types of commitment (niṣṭhā). The purpose of performing these prescribed duties from the beginning of creation was to establish the welfare and attainment of supreme good (abhyudaya-niṣreyasa-prāpti) through the Vedic doctrines (vedārtha-sampardāya). However, Śrī Bhagavān, the all-knowing Lord, addressed the non-evil (anagha) and sinless (apāpa) beings.

When asked, “What is this dual commitment?” the Lord clarifies: Knowledge-yoga (jñāna-yoga) is yoga of knowledge itself for sāṅkhya practitioners who have discerned the difference between the self and the non-self, and who have undertaken the practices of brahmacarya (celibacy) and renunciation (saṃnyāsa), dedicated to Vedānta knowledge and the pursuit of supreme liberation. On the other hand, Karma-yoga (karmayoga) is the yoga of action, and thus, the commitment (niṣṭhā) of yogis who follow Karma-yoga is defined accordingly.

If a single individual were to combine knowledge and action for a single purpose, as instructed by the Lord, either in the Gītā or the Vedas, how then could Arjuna, being attracted and favored, consistently maintain a dual commitment to both knowledge and action? If, alternatively, Bhagavān had taught that after hearing both knowledge and action, Arjuna would practice both, then why would Arjuna ask, “Why are You engaging me in such dreadful (ghora) action?” It would render Arjuna’s question invalid if Bhagavān had previously instructed that one should not undertake both simultaneously, leading to the impossibility of achieving both simultaneously.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Technical Analysis

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- **Dvividha Niṣṭhā (द्विविधा निष्ठा):**
  The "twofold modes of commitment" or "dual dedication" refers to the two paths Śrī Bhagavān outlines: knowledge-yoga (jñāna-yoga) for sāṅkhya practitioners and action-yoga (karma-yoga) for yogis.

- **Traivaṛṇikān (त्रैवर्णिकान्):**
  The three-fold caste system (brahmins, kshatriyas, vaishyas) traditionally responsible for different duties in Vedic society.

- **Jñāna-Yoga vs. Karma-Yoga:**
  - **Jñāna-Yoga (ज्ञानयोग):** The path of knowledge, emphasizing discernment between the self and the non-self, suited for those pursuing intellectual and spiritual realization.
  - **Karma-Yoga (कर्मयोग):** The path of action, emphasizing duty-bound actions without attachment, suited for those actively engaged in societal roles.

- **Saṃnyāsa (संन्यास):**
  Renunciation of worldly life, applicable primarily to sannyāsins (renunciates).

- **Brahmacarya (ब्रह्मचर्य):**
  The practice of celibacy and self-discipline, a prerequisite for higher spiritual practices.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Declaration of Two Paths:**
   Śrī Bhagavān identifies two distinct paths based on the practitioner's commitment and societal role: knowledge for sāṅkhya practitioners and action for yogis.

2. **Purpose of Two Paths:**
   These paths are intended to cater to different types of individuals within the varṇa system, ensuring that all societal members can pursue spiritual goals according to their nature and duties.

3. **Logical Consistency:**
   Śaṅkara highlights that if Bhagavān had instructed a single individual to pursue both paths simultaneously, it would lead to confusion and invalidate Arjuna’s subsequent question about why he is being asked to engage in dreadful actions if knowledge is superior.

4. **Scriptural Alignment:**
   The commentary underscores that Bhagavān’s instructions are aligned with Vedic and Upaniṣadic teachings, ensuring that the paths to liberation are coherent and doctrinally consistent.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Varṇa System:**
  By specifying "traivaṛṇikān," Śaṅkara integrates the Gītā’s teachings with the traditional Vedic social structure, indicating that spiritual paths are also tailored to societal roles.

- **Consistency with Prior Arguments:**
  This verse and its commentary maintain the earlier established idea that knowledge and action are not equally mandated for the same individual but are instead suited to different types of practitioners.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s delineation of two distinct paths aligns with Kantian ethics by assigning duties based on rational capacities and societal roles. Knowledge-yoga corresponds to the realm of pure reason, aiming for intellectual and moral clarity, while Karma-yoga corresponds to practical reason, emphasizing duty-bound actions. This division ensures that moral obligations are appropriately aligned with the individual's rational capabilities and societal responsibilities, maintaining universal consistency without overburdening any single path.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte emphasized the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s distinction between jñāna-yoga and karma-yoga resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that different individuals must engage in varying degrees of self-striving based on their inherent dispositions and societal roles. Knowledge-yoga represents the self’s inward striving for self-realization, while Karma-yoga represents the outward striving through duty. This dual approach ensures that the self’s quest for freedom and realization is harmoniously integrated with societal obligations, reflecting Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through both internal and external efforts.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves the resolution of contradictions through a higher synthesis. Śaṅkara’s presentation of two distinct yet complementary paths can be seen as a dialectical synthesis where knowledge and action are not opposing forces but integrated aspects of a unified spiritual journey. The initial thesis (jñāna-yoga) and antithesis (karma-yoga) are reconciled in the synthesis of comprehensive spiritual practice tailored to individual capacities and societal roles. This ensures that the spiritual evolution of the individual is both intellectually grounded and practically engaged, achieving a holistic form of liberation that transcends mere theoretical or practical extremes.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary elucidate the dual approach to spiritual practice outlined in Bhagavad Gītā Chapter 3. By defining two distinct paths—knowledge-yoga for sāṅkhya practitioners and action-yoga for yogis—Śaṅkara maintains doctrinal consistency and logical coherence within the Gītā’s teachings. Technically, this division ensures that individuals follow paths suited to their societal roles and personal dispositions, preventing logical inconsistencies such as Arjuna’s questioning if both paths were imposed on a single practitioner.

Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by upholding universal moral duties tailored to rational capacities, Fichtean self-striving through both inward knowledge and outward action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by reconciling different spiritual practices into a cohesive system. This integrated approach preserves the integrity of Śaṅkara’s exegesis, demonstrating that the path to liberation is multifaceted and adaptable to individual needs while maintaining a unified doctrinal foundation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation is attainable through appropriate adherence to either knowledge or action, based on one's societal role and personal disposition. This ensures that the Gītā’s teachings are both practically applicable and philosophically robust, guiding individuals towards mokṣa in a manner that is harmonious with their inherent nature and societal responsibilities.
