### Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)

**Verse (Bhagavad Gītā 3.22)**
```
यदि तत्र ते लोकसंघारकर्तव्यतायां विप्रतिपत्तिः तर्हि मां किं न पश्यसि ।
न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन ।
नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि ॥ २२ ॥
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
यद्यत् कर्म आचरति करोति श्रेष्ठः प्रधानः तत्तदेव कर्म आचरति इतरः अन्यः जनः तदनुगतः ।
किञ्च सः श्रेष्ठः यत् प्रमाणं कुरुते लौकिकं वैदिकं वा लोकः तत् अनुवर्तते तदेव प्रमाणीकरोति इत्यर्थः ॥ २२ ॥
```

### Transliteration (IAST)

**Verse**
```
yadi tatra te lokasaṅghārakartavyatāyāṃ vipratipattiḥ tarhi māṃ kiṃ na paśyasi ।
na me pārthāsti kartavyaṃ triṣu lokeṣu kiñcan ।
nānavāptam avāptavyaṃ varta eva ca karmaṇi ॥ 22 ॥
```

**Commentary**
```
yadyat karma ācarati karoti śreṣṭhaḥ pradhānaḥ tattadeva karma ācarati itaraḥ anyaḥ janaḥ tadanuvartaḥ ।
kiñca saḥ śreṣṭhaḥ yat pramāṇaṃ kurute laukikaṃ vaidikaṃ vā lokaḥ tat anuvartate tadeva pramāṇīkaroṣi ityarthaḥ ॥ 22 ॥
```

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“But if you have doubts about your duty in maintaining the world, then why do you not see Me?
O Partha, I have no duty in any of the three worlds.
Nor is there any action in which I have not attained or have yet to attain, nor anything else; I merely continue in action.” (Gītā 3.22)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that Arjuna's doubt about the necessity of performing his duty (lokasaṅghāra) stems from his misunderstanding of action and duty. Krishna asserts that He Himself has no duty in any of the three worlds (physical, celestial, or spiritual), as He is the Supreme Being who is beyond the constraints of karma. Therefore, Krishna emphasizes that there is no action that He has not performed or does not need to perform. His continuous engagement in action is not driven by any desire or necessity but is inherent to His divine nature. Śaṅkara elucidates that Krishna's lack of personal duty highlights His transcendental status and the importance for humans to understand their own duties without conflating them with divine actions.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing duty without attachment aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an expression of the categorical imperative, where one acts according to maxims that can be universally applied. By performing one’s duty selflessly, individuals uphold universal moral laws, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By emulating figures like Janaka, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the pursuit of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Divine Detachment:**
   - Krishna's declaration of having no duties emphasizes His transcendental status, distinguishing divine actions from human duties.

2. **Importance of Selfless Duty:**
   - For humans, performing one's duty selflessly is essential for maintaining cosmic and societal harmony.

3. **Modeling by Exemplary Individuals:**
   - Exemplary figures like Janaka perform their duties selflessly, setting a precedent for others to follow.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The teachings align with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Understanding Divine and Human Duties:**
  - Distinguishes between the divine nature of Krishna and human responsibilities, encouraging individuals to focus on their own duties without misapplying divine principles.

- **Role of Yajña (Sacrifice):**
  - Yajña symbolizes selfless action dedicated to the welfare of society and maintenance of cosmic order.

- **Mokṣa through Selfless Action:**
  - Performing duties selflessly leads to both material prosperity and spiritual liberation (mokṣa).

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Ensures logical consistency and doctrinal integrity by harmonizing ethical duty with spiritual principles, fostering a unified path to liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
