### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
"From what cause, O Arjuna, do they fail to follow Your doctrine, neglecting other duties and not following their own duty? How can they not be overwhelmed by the faults of transgressing Your instructions?

There, indeed —

Even the wise, with knowledge, act in accordance with their nature. All living beings follow their nature, what can restrain them?" (Gītā 3.33)
```

### Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)

Śrī Śaṅkarācārya elucidates that individuals, even those who possess knowledge (jñāna), are governed by their inherent nature (prakṛti) and their qualities (guṇa). These individuals act according to their natural dispositions, leading them to perform actions aligned with their own duties (svadharma) rather than adhering strictly to the divine instructions (tvadīyaṃ mataṃ) provided by Krishna. Śaṅkara emphasizes that since all beings are bound by their intrinsic nature, attempting to enforce divine doctrine without considering individual dispositions is ineffective. The natural inclinations of beings drive their actions, and thus, the wise understand and accept that true harmony is achieved by aligning one's own duties with one's nature, rather than trying to change others' inherent dispositions.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing actions according to one’s inherent nature aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty (dharma) rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an embodiment of the categorical imperative, where actions are performed according to maxims that can be universally applied. By understanding and aligning one’s duties with one’s nature, individuals uphold universal moral laws, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity. This resonates with Śaṅkara’s teachings on the importance of duty-bound actions for universal harmony and personal liberation.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty according to one’s inherent nature resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By performing actions selflessly and adhering to duty aligned with one’s nature, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical responsibility.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the potential conflict between enforcing universal duties and respecting individual nature is addressed by Śaṅkara’s teaching that individuals should perform their duties in accordance with their inherent nature. This synthesis ensures that actions are harmonious with both individual dispositions and universal principles, leading to spiritual liberation and societal harmony. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s guidance as achieving a higher unity where duty is fulfilled without causing unnecessary disruption, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Impact of Inherent Nature:**
   - Individuals are governed by their inherent nature (prakṛti) and qualities (guṇa), which drive their actions and duties.

2. **Role of Knowledge:**
   - Even the knowledgeable act according to their nature, indicating that knowledge alone does not override inherent dispositions.

3. **Ineffectiveness of Restraining Nature:**
   - Attempting to restrain or change individuals’ actions contrary to their nature is futile and can lead to further confusion and disorder.

4. **Emphasis on Self-Aligned Duty:**
   - Encourages individuals to perform their own duties in harmony with their nature, fostering personal and societal harmony.

5. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - Aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through ethical engagement, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual principles.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Understanding True Nature:**
  - Recognizes the necessity of understanding one's own nature and duties while acknowledging the limitations of others who are deluded by ignorance.

- **Role of Knowledge:**
  - Highlights that true knowledge involves aligning one’s actions with one’s inherent nature rather than attempting to impose external standards.

- **Ethical Responsibility:**
  - Emphasizes that the enlightened have an ethical responsibility to uphold cosmic and societal order by acting in accordance with their knowledge and refraining from interfering with the ignorant.

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Harmonizes ethical duty with spiritual principles, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to life that fosters both moral integrity and spiritual liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and the realization of the true self in alignment with one's inherent nature, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
