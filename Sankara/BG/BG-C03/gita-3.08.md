**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
नियतं नित्यं शास्त्रोपदिष्टम्, यो यस्मिन् कर्मणि अधिकृतः फलाय च अश्रुतं तत् नियतं कर्म, तत् कुरु त्वं हे अर्जुन, यतः कर्म ज्यायः अधिकतरं फलतः, हि यस्मात् अकर्मणः अकरणात् अनारम्भात् । कथम्? शरीरयात्रा शरीरस्थितिः अपि च ते तव न प्रसिध्येत् प्रसिद्धिं न गच्छेत् अकर्मणः अकरणात् । अतः दृष्टः कर्माकर्मणोर्विशेषो लोके ॥ ८ ॥

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
O Arjuna, perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible without action.” (Gītā 3.8)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śaṅkara explains: The scriptures prescribe that one should perform actions (karma) consistently and diligently, dedicated to obtaining their results (phalāya) without attachment to them. Therefore, O Arjuna, you should perform your duty, as action is superior to inaction because without action, even the sustenance of your body would not be possible. How? Even the maintenance of the body and its functions would not attain fame (prasiddhi) if one remains inactive (akarmaṇaḥ). Thus, Śrī Bhagavān has clarified the distinction between action and inaction in the world.

- **Jyāyo (ज्यायो):**
  Superior or better; indicating the preference of action over inaction.

- **Akarmanaḥ (अकर्मणः):**
  Inaction; the absence of performing prescribed duties.

- **Śarīrayātrā (शरीरयात्रा):**

  Fame or renown; in this context, the benefits or results derived from performing duties.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Directive Command:**
   - The verse begins with a clear instruction to Arjuna to perform his prescribed duties (karma).

2. **Comparison of Action and Inaction:**
   - Action (karma) is declared superior to inaction (akarmaṇaḥ).

3. **Practical Necessity:**
   - Emphasizes that even the basic maintenance of the body requires action, underscoring the indispensability of performing duties.

4. **Consequences of Inaction:**
   - Inaction would lead to the inability to sustain the body and achieve results, which is considered detrimental.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **Prescribed Duty:**
   - Scriptures mandate the performance of duties consistently.

2. **Superiority of Action:**
   - Performing duty is better than refraining from action.

3. **Necessity for Sustenance:**
   - Action is necessary for the physical maintenance of the body.

4. **Deterrent Against Inaction:**
   - Highlighting the negative consequences of not performing duties to encourage adherence.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Consistency with Previous Verses:**
  - Aligns with the earlier teachings where Arjuna questions the necessity of action if knowledge is superior.
  - Reinforces the idea that action, when performed correctly, complements spiritual knowledge.

- **Alignment with Vedic and Upaniṣadic Teachings:**
  - Emphasizes dharma (duty) as a fundamental principle in Vedic philosophy.
  - Integrates the Upaniṣadic notion that action performed without attachment leads to spiritual growth.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing prescribed duties aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. By performing karma without attachment to results, one adheres to a universal moral law, ensuring that actions are morally consistent and devoid of selfish motives. Kant would support Śaṅkara’s stance that duty-bound action is ethically superior and necessary for moral integrity.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. This active engagement through duty (karma-yoga) facilitates self-realization and moral development, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of the self striving toward ethical and spiritual goals through intentional action.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the potential conflict between the pursuit of knowledge (jñāna) and the performance of duty (karma) is reconciled by Śaṅkara’s teaching that action is essential and superior to inaction, thereby integrating practical and intellectual pursuits. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty complements spiritual knowledge.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary underscore the indispensable role of action (karma) in the pursuit of spiritual liberation (mokṣa). Technically, it establishes that prescribed duties must be performed consistently and without attachment to their outcomes, as action is superior to inaction for both practical sustenance and spiritual progress.

Philosophically, the analysis aligns with:

- **Kantian Ethics:**
  Advocates for duty-bound actions based on universal moral principles, ensuring ethical consistency.

- **Fichtean Self-Striving:**
  Emphasizes the active engagement in duties as essential for self-realization and moral development.

- **Hegelian Dialectical Unity:**
  Integrates action and knowledge into a unified spiritual path, resolving potential conflicts through higher synthesis.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces the Bhagavad Gītā’s teaching that performing one’s duties diligently and without attachment is essential for both maintaining worldly order and advancing spiritually. This integrated approach ensures that individuals contribute to societal well-being while progressing on their spiritual journey, maintaining logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Gītā’s philosophy.
