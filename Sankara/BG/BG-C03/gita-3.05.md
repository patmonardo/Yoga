### Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)

**Verse (Bhagavad Gītā 3.5)**
```
कस्मात् पुनः कारणात् कर्मसंन्यासमात्रादेव केवलात् ज्ञानरहितात् सिद्धिं नैष्कर्म्यलक्षणां पुरुषो नाधिगच्छति इति हेत्वाकाङ्क्षायामाह —
न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत् ।
कार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः ॥ ५ ॥
न हि यस्मात् क्षणमपि कालं जातु कदाचित् कश्चित् तिष्ठति अकर्मकृत् सन् । कस्मात् ? कार्यते प्रवर्त्यते हि यस्मात् अवश एव अस्वतन्त्र एव कर्म सर्वः प्राणी प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः प्रकृतितो जातैः सत्त्वरजस्तमोभिः गुणैः । अज्ञ इति वाक्यशेषः, यतो वक्ष्यति ‘गुणैर्यो न विचाल्यते’ (भ. गी. १४ । २३) इति । साङ्‍ख्यानां पृथक्करणात् अज्ञानामेव हि कर्मयोगः, न ज्ञानिनाम् । ज्ञानिनां तु गुणैरचाल्यमानानां स्वतश्चलनाभावात् कर्मयोगो नोपपद्यते । तथा च व्याख्यातम् ‘वेदाविनाशिनम्’ (भ. गी. २ । २१) इत्यत्र ॥ ५ ॥

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“But why then, for the sake of achieving liberation (mokṣa) through renunciation of action alone, devoid of knowledge, does a person not attain perfection by solely embracing abstention from action?”
```

**Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān responds:
“Indeed, no one can ever attain non-action (naiṣkarmya) simply by refraining from action, even for a moment.
All beings, driven by their inherent qualities (guṇaiḥ) derived from nature (prakṛti), are compelled to act.
No one can remain inactive at any time; thus, why then do You, O Janārdana, compel me to engage in action?”

Arjuna argues that without initiating action, one cannot attain non-action. However, since all living entities are inherently driven by their qualities and nature, complete renunciation is unattainable. Śrī Bhagavān points out that if renunciation were merely an alternative option, then action and knowledge would be incompatible, which contradicts the earlier teaching that both should be pursued. Moreover, knowledge-yoga (jñāna-yoga) does not apply to those who are already committed to action (karma-yoga). Therefore, the dual commitment to both knowledge and action is not feasible for a single individual, and thus, non-action alone does not lead to perfection.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Technical Analysis

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- **Karma-saṃnyāsa (कर्मसंन्यास):**
  Renunciation of action. It refers to the abandonment of all forms of duty and action as a means to attain liberation.

- **Jñāna (ज्ञान):**
  Knowledge or wisdom, specifically spiritual or discriminative knowledge that discerns the true nature of reality.

- **Naiṣkarmya (नैष्कर्म्य):**
  The state of non-action or inaction, which is not attained merely by abstaining from action.

- **Prakṛti (प्रकृति):**
  Nature or the material world, including the inherent qualities (guṇaiḥ) that drive an individual's actions.

- **Karma-yoga (कर्मयोग):**
  The path of selfless action performed without attachment to results, as a means to attain spiritual liberation.

- **Sāṅkhyānāṃ Pṛthakkaraṇāt (साङ्‍ख्यानां पृथक्करणात्):**
  Separation or differentiation of the Sāṅkhya principles, indicating that knowledge-yoga and action-yoga are not mutually exclusive.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Arjuna’s Objection:**
   Arjuna questions why he is being compelled to engage in action if renunciation of action alone does not lead to liberation. He points out the inherent contradiction in being instructed to act when non-action is supposed to be the path to perfection.

2. **Śaṅkara’s Rebuttal:**
   Śrī Bhagavān explains that non-action alone does not lead to liberation because all beings are inherently driven to act due to their inherent qualities (guṇaiḥ). Therefore, mere abstention from action without the integration of knowledge is insufficient.

3. **Logical Inconsistency Highlighted:**
   The commentary emphasizes that if renunciation of action were the sole path to liberation, it would conflict with the natural tendencies of beings and the necessity of action driven by inherent qualities.

4. **Integration of Knowledge and Action:**
   Śrī Bhagavān argues that knowledge-yoga and action-yoga must be integrated. Knowledge serves as a means to purify the mind and align actions with spiritual goals, making the dual pursuit feasible and necessary.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Bhagavad Gītā Verses:**
  The commentary references Bhagavad Gītā 2.21 and 14.23 to support the argument that renunciation and knowledge are not to be pursued in isolation but in harmony with inherent qualities and duties.

- **Consistency with Prior Arguments:**
  Śaṅkara maintains a consistent stance that the path to liberation involves both knowledge and action, rather than advocating for complete renunciation of action alone. This aligns with the overall teachings of the Gītā, which advocate for a balanced approach.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s argument aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing that action driven by duty (karma-yoga) must be informed by pure rational knowledge (jñāna). The interplay between knowledge and action ensures that moral duties are performed consistently and universally without leading to moral dissonance or contradiction. Arjuna’s confusion arises from a misinterpretation that seeks to separate duty (action) from knowledge, which Kantian ethics would reject as it undermines the universality and rational consistency of moral law.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s integration of knowledge and action mirrors Fichte’s ideal of the self striving toward self-realization through both intellectual and practical endeavors. Action (karma-yoga) represents the self’s outward striving to fulfill duties and purify the will, while knowledge (jñāna) represents the inward striving for self-awareness and understanding. This dual approach ensures holistic self-actualization, consistent with Fichtean thought.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves the resolution of contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between the paths of knowledge and action. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this tension by demonstrating that knowledge-yoga and action-yoga are not mutually exclusive but are complementary aspects of a unified spiritual journey. This synthesis aligns with Hegelian principles, where opposing elements are reconciled into a coherent and comprehensive whole, thereby achieving a higher understanding and unity in the path to liberation.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

In this segment, Śaṅkara addresses Arjuna’s objection regarding the apparent contradiction between renunciation of action and the necessity of action for liberation. Technically, he dismantles the notion that non-action alone can lead to mokṣa by highlighting the inherent drive of beings to act due to their nature (prakṛti) and qualities (guṇaiḥ). Philosophically, this aligns with Kantian ethics by maintaining universal moral duties, Fichtean self-striving through both knowledge and action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating knowledge and action into a cohesive spiritual path.

Śaṅkara reinforces that liberation is not attainable through mere abstention from action but requires the integration of knowledge and action. This ensures that the spiritual path remains practical and aligned with the inherent nature of beings, thereby preserving the logical and doctrinal consistency of the Gītā’s teachings.

Thus, the analysis confirms that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through a harmonious combination of knowledge (jñāna) and action (karma), rather than through the exclusive pursuit of renunciation or knowledge alone. This integrated approach provides a balanced and effective path to spiritual perfection, consistent with the overarching philosophy of the Bhagavad Gītā as interpreted by Śaṅkara.
