### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“How then, O Janārdana (Krishna), should the gods be worshiped?
Perform sacrifices through righteous actions so that the gods may also worship and bless you.
By worshiping one another, you will attain supreme well-being.” (Gītā 3.11)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that through yajña (sacrifice), the gods like Indra are pleased and thus bestow their blessings and rains upon you. By performing yajña, the gods will reciprocate by blessing and nurturing you with beneficial rains and other blessings. In this manner, by worshiping each other mutually, you will attain the highest form of well-being and the ultimate sign of liberation (mokṣa) through the process of acquiring knowledge. Additionally, you will achieve heavenly abodes or other superior forms of well-being.

  Sacrifice or ritual action performed in accordance with Vedic injunctions. It symbolizes selfless action dedicated to the divine and the maintenance of cosmic order.

- **Deva (देव):**
  Gods or divine beings who oversee various aspects of the cosmos. They are recipients of yajña and bestow blessings upon those who perform it.

- **Śreyah (श्रेयः):**
  Well-being, prosperity, or ultimate good. It signifies both material prosperity and spiritual advancement.

- **Vṛṣṭyādinā (वृष्ट्यादिना):**
  By means of rains and other blessings.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Directive to Perform Yajña:**
   - Śrī Bhagavān instructs Arjuna to perform yajña (sacrifice) as a means to gain the favor of the gods.

2. **Reciprocal Blessings:**
   - By performing yajña, the gods (devas) will reciprocate by bestowing blessings such as rains, which are essential for sustenance and prosperity.

3. **Mutual Worship and Attainment of Well-being:**
   - The act of mutual worship through yajña leads to the attainment of supreme well-being (śreyah) and ultimately contributes to mokṣa (liberation).

4. **Integration of Knowledge and Action:**
   - The process of performing yajña is linked with the acquisition of knowledge, emphasizing that understanding and action must be integrated for spiritual progress.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **Action Leads to Divine Favor:**
   - Performing yajña is a means to earn the favor of the gods, who control essential aspects of the natural world (e.g., rains).

2. **Divine Favor Ensures Prosperity:**
   - The blessings from the gods result in material prosperity and support, which are necessary for sustaining life and pursuing spiritual goals.

3. **Mutual Worship Enhances Spiritual Growth:**
   - Engaging in yajña fosters a sense of mutual worship and interconnectedness, which contributes to overall well-being and spiritual liberation.

4. **Knowledge and Action Synergy:**
   - The integration of knowledge (jñāna) and action (karma) through yajña ensures a balanced path to mokṣa, combining intellectual understanding with practical duties.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Earlier Verses:**
  - This verse builds upon the earlier teachings where Arjuna questions the necessity of action if knowledge is superior. Śaṅkara reinforces that action, when performed selflessly and with proper understanding, complements knowledge and leads to both material and spiritual well-being.

- **Alignment with Vedic and Upaniṣadic Teachings:**
  - The emphasis on yajña aligns with Vedic practices that advocate for ritualistic actions to maintain cosmic order and seek divine blessings. Upaniṣadic teachings on karma and jñāna are integrated, highlighting that disciplined action is essential for spiritual advancement.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing yajña aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty rather than personal inclination. By performing yajña selflessly, one adheres to a universal moral law, ensuring that actions are morally consistent and devoid of selfish motives. This reflects Kant’s notion that duty must be performed for its own sake, not for the outcomes it produces.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform yajña resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. This balance ensures that self-realization involves both inward knowledge and outward action, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (yajña) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary emphasize the indispensable role of yajña (sacrifice) in maintaining societal order and facilitating both material prosperity and spiritual advancement. Technically, it establishes that performing prescribed duties through yajña is not only beneficial but necessary for the sustenance and expansion of life. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through both knowledge and action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating action and knowledge into a cohesive spiritual path.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Desire:**
  - Yajña serves as a means to fulfill both societal duties and personal desires, ensuring that actions are purposeful and aligned with cosmic order.

- **Purposeful Rituals:**
  - Emphasizes the importance of intention in performing rituals, ensuring that actions contribute to both personal and collective well-being.

- **Moral and Spiritual Harmony:**
  - Balances the performance of duties with spiritual objectives, maintaining harmony between practical responsibilities and spiritual growth.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (yajña) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
