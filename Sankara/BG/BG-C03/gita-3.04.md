### Translation (English)

**Verse and Commentary**
```
O Arjuna, You sorrowfully declare, “O Janārdana (Krishna), I feel bewildered in my weakened mind by Your words, akin to a tangled knot. You seem to be misleading my intellect; how can You, who are intent on confusing my understanding, continue to engage me in such dreadful (ghora) action? Therefore, I say, “You are indeed confusing my understanding.”

If You believe that knowledge and action are to be performed simultaneously by the same individual, as instructed by the Lord, how then can Arjuna, who has a suitable intellectual disposition aligned with only one path (knowledge over action), logically assert that knowledge is superior to action? This assertion, however, does not hold up logically.

If indeed, in the realm of dedicated action, even knowledge has been declared superior by the Lord, then how could Arjuna’s focused inquiry “If it is superior” make sense? The Lord has not previously stated, “I will speak separately about knowledge and action, not both together,” leading an individual who perceives both as achievable to desire only one path for attaining both. Therefore, such a statement does not allow for the combination of knowledge and action, rendering Arjuna’s question “If it is superior” invalid.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Technical Analysis

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- **Buddhi (बुद्धि):**
  Refers to intellect or discriminative knowledge, especially in the spiritual context. It signifies understanding that discerns between the real (ātman) and the unreal (prakṛti).

- **Karma (कर्म):**
  Action, particularly duty-bound action performed without attachment to results. In the Gītā, Karma-yoga emphasizes performing one's prescribed duties as a path to liberation.

- **Pratyavāya (प्रत्यवाय):**
  The sin of omission; failing to perform one's prescribed duties, leading to negative consequences.

- **Saṃnyāsa (संन्यास):**
  Renunciation of worldly life, applicable primarily to sannyāsins (renunciates).

- **Jñānakarma-niṣṭhā (ज्ञानकर्मनिष्ठा):**
  The commitment or steadfastness in combining knowledge (jñāna) and action (karma) as prescribed by the Gītā.

- **Traivaṛṇikān (त्रैवर्णिकान्):**
  The three-fold caste system (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas) traditionally responsible for different societal duties and spiritual practices.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Arjuna’s Complaint:**
   Arjuna expresses his confusion and distress over Krishna's directive to engage in dreadful action despite Krishna's earlier emphasis on the superiority of knowledge (buddhi).

2. **Śaṅkara’s Critique of Dual Commitment:**
   Śaṅkara critiques the notion that an individual should simultaneously uphold both knowledge and action without logical inconsistency. He argues that such a dual commitment leads to confusion, as Arjuna's question exemplifies.

3. **Logical Inconsistency:**
   If knowledge and action are to be combined as equally important paths, Arjuna’s objection against engaging in terrible actions contradicts the supposed superiority of knowledge. This inconsistency undermines the rational basis for combining both paths for the same individual.

4. **Scriptural Authority and Consistency:**
   Śaṅkara emphasizes that the Gītā, along with Upaniṣads and other scriptures, advocates for a singular, coherent path to liberation. The inconsistency arises only if one attempts to merge the two paths without proper doctrinal backing.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Gītā Verses:**
  The analysis refers directly to Bhagavad Gītā 3.1 and 3.2, highlighting Arjuna’s questions and the apparent contradiction between knowledge and action.

- **Alignment with Scriptural Teachings:**
  Śaṅkara aligns his interpretation with authoritative texts, ensuring that the integration of knowledge and action is doctrinally sound and not merely a speculative amalgamation.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. The Gītā’s distinction between knowledge and action can be seen as aligning with Kantian ethics by assigning duties based on rational capacities and societal roles. Śaṅkara’s critique underscores that if both knowledge and action were equally mandated for the same individual, it would lead to moral dissonance, akin to conflicting duties in Kantian terms. Kant would argue for the necessity of a coherent moral law that does not impose contradictory obligations, similar to Śaṅkara’s insistence on logical consistency in the paths to liberation.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte emphasized the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. The Gītā’s framework, as interpreted by Śaṅkara, resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that different individuals must engage in varying degrees of self-striving based on their inherent dispositions and societal roles. Knowledge-yoga represents the self’s inward striving for self-realization, while Karma-yoga represents the outward striving through duty. Śaṅkara’s analysis suggests that true self-realization involves both internal knowledge and external action, maintaining the integrity of Fichte’s idea of self-actualization through both intellectual and practical efforts.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves the resolution of contradictions through a higher synthesis. Arjuna’s confusion highlights a potential contradiction between the paths of knowledge and action. Śaṅkara’s commentary aims to resolve this by demonstrating that knowledge and action are not mutually exclusive but are integrated aspects of a unified spiritual journey. This reflects Hegelian dialectical progress, where the thesis (knowledge) and antithesis (action) are reconciled into a synthesis that transcends and includes both, ensuring a coherent and holistic approach to liberation.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

In this segment, Śaṅkara addresses Arjuna’s confusion regarding the simultaneous emphasis on knowledge and action. Technically, he dismantles the notion that both paths can be equally upheld by a single individual without leading to logical inconsistencies. Philosophically, this aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for coherent moral duties, with Fichtean self-striving through both knowledge and action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating conflicting paths into a higher synthesis.

Śaṅkara reinforces that liberation (mokṣa) is attained through knowledge alone, as action does not contribute directly to mokṣa but serves as a preparatory means for those not yet established in steady knowledge. This ensures that the spiritual path remains logically consistent and doctrinally sound, preventing the confusion exemplified by Arjuna’s questioning.

Thus, Śaṅkara's commentary upholds the Gītā’s teaching that while both knowledge and action are important, they must be understood in their proper context and not conflated in a way that leads to contradiction. This maintains the integrity of the spiritual teachings and provides a clear, rational path to liberation.
