## III. Commentary

### Sanskrit
तस्मात् पापिष्ठम् अज्ञानसम्भूतम् अज्ञानात् अविवेकात् जातं हृत्स्थं हृदि बुद्धौ स्थितं ज्ञानासिना शोकमोहादिदोषहरं सम्यग्दर्शनं ज्ञानं तदेव असिः खङ्गः तेन ज्ञानासिना आत्मनः स्वस्य, आत्मविषयत्वात् संशयस्य । न हि परस्य संशयः परेण च्छेत्तव्यतां प्राप्तः, येन स्वस्येति विशेष्येत । अतः आत्मविषयोऽपि स्वस्यैव भवति । छित्त्वा एनं संशयं स्वविनाशहेतुभूतम् , योगं सम्यग्दर्शनोपायं कर्मानुष्ठानम् आतिष्ठ कुर्वित्यर्थः । उत्तिष्ठ च इदानीं युद्धाय भारत इति ॥

### Translation
Therefore, this most sinful doubt born of ignorance, born from lack of discrimination, residing in the heart, in the intellect, with the sword of knowledge - knowledge which is right vision that removes defects like sorrow and delusion, that itself is the sword - with that sword of knowledge of oneself, because doubt pertains to oneself. Indeed another's doubt cannot be cut by another, such that it would be specified as "of oneself". Thus though pertaining to the self it belongs to oneself alone. Having cut this doubt which is the cause of one's own destruction, establish yourself in yoga, the means of right vision, the practice of action - this is the meaning. And arise now for battle, O Bhārata!
