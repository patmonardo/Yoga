### C. Translation
"Thus, received through the succession of kṣatriyas, the royal sages – who were both kings and seers – knew this yoga. That yoga has been lost here through great length of time, its tradition of transmission having been broken. O Parantapa (Scorcher of Foes) – those who are opposed to the Self are called 'para' (foes), and one who burns them like the sun with rays of valor and brilliance is called Parantapa, meaning 'tormentor of enemies.'"
