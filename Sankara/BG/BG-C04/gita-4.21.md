### Translation
But one who, contrary to what was previously stated, even before beginning actions, having attained self-realization in Brahman - which is the innermost self of all and actionless - being free from desires for seen and unseen desired objects, seeing no purpose in actions meant for seen and unseen ends, renouncing action along with its means, acting only for the maintenance of the body, a renunciant established in knowledge is liberated - to show this meaning, he says:

### Transliteration
nirāśīḥ nirgatāḥ āśiṣaḥ yasmāt saḥ nirāśīḥ, yatacittātmā cittam antaḥkaraṇam ātmā bāhyaḥ kāryakaraṇasaṅghātaḥ tau ubhāvapi yatau saṃyatau yena saḥ yatacittātmā, tyaktasarvaparigrahaḥ tyaktaḥ sarvaḥ parigrahaḥ yena saḥ tyaktasarvaparigrahaḥ, śārīraṃ śarīrasthitimātraprayojanam, kevalaṃ tatrāpi abhimānavarjitam, karma kurvan na āpnoti na prāpnoti kilbiṣam aniṣṭarūpaṃ pāpaṃ dharmaṃ ca | dharmo'pi mumukṣoḥ kilbiṣameva bandhāpādakatvāt | tasmāt tābhyāṃ muktaḥ bhavati, saṃsārāt mukto bhavati ityarthaḥ ||

### Translation
'Free from hopes' means one from whom hopes have departed is free from hopes. 'With mind and self controlled' - mind means the internal organ, self means the external aggregate of body and senses - both of these are controlled, restrained, by whom, that one has mind and self controlled. 'Having abandoned all possessions' means one by whom all possessions have been abandoned. 'Bodily' means only for the purpose of maintaining the body, 'only' means even there without ego-sense, performing action, does not incur, does not obtain evil in the form of both undesirable sin and merit. For merit too is evil for the seeker of liberation since it causes bondage. Therefore one becomes liberated from both of these, meaning becomes liberated from worldly existence.

## II. Analysis of Commentary Structure

### A. Word Analysis Pattern
1. Compound Breakdowns:
   - nirāśīḥ → nirgatāḥ āśiṣaḥ
   - yatacittātmā → yata + citta + ātmā

2. Liberation Terms:
   - mumukṣu (seeker of liberation)
   - bandhāpādaka (causing bondage)
   - saṃsāra (worldly existence)

### B. Critical Distinctions

1. Dharma/Adharma Transcendence:

[Full transliteration continues...]

### Translation
Regarding 'śārīraṃ kevalaṃ karma' (mere bodily action), is what is meant action performed by the body, or action for the mere maintenance of the body? And what follows from either interpretation - whether it means action performed by the body or action for mere bodily maintenance?

[Initial pūrvapakṣa:] If what is meant is action performed by the body, then saying that "even while performing prohibited action with visible and invisible purposes through the body, one incurs no evil" would involve a contradiction. And saying that "performing scriptural action with visible and invisible purposes through the body, one incurs no evil" would involve prohibiting what is not obtained. From the qualification "performing bodily action" and the use of the word "only," it would mean that performing action through speech and mind, which is the subject of injunction and prohibition, designated by the terms merit and demerit, one incurs evil. Here too, in the case of performing prescribed actions through speech and mind, the statement about incurring evil would be contradictory. And in the case of engaging in prohibited actions, it would be merely a pointless restatement of what is already known.

[Siddhānta:] But when what is meant is action for the mere maintenance of the body, then not performing other action - which has visible and invisible purposes, is known through injunction and prohibition, and is performed through body, speech and mind - but performing, through those very means of body etc., only action for bodily maintenance (as indicated by the word "only"), without the ego-sense of "I am doing," performing mere bodily movement from the worldly perspective, one incurs no evil. Since for such a one there is no possibility of incurring evil designated by the term sin, one does not incur evil in the form of worldly existence; due to all actions being burned by the fire of knowledge, one is liberated without obstruction - this is merely a restatement of the result of right knowledge as previously stated. Thus when the meaning of "śārīraṃ kevalaṃ karma" is understood in this way, it becomes free from defect.

## III. First Pūrvapakṣa Examination

### A. Text Presentation

#### Sanskrit
उच्यते — यदा शरीरनिर्वर्त्यं कर्म शारीरम् अभिप्रेतं स्यात् , तदा दृष्टादृष्टप्रयोजनं कर्म प्रतिषिद्धमपि शरीरेण कुर्वन् नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् इति ब्रुवतो विरुद्धाभिधानं प्रसज्येत । शास्त्रीयं च कर्म दृष्टादृष्टप्रयोजनं शरीरेण कुर्वन् नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् इत्यपि ब्रुवतः अप्राप्तप्रतिषेधप्रसङ्गः ।

#### Translation
It is said: If what is meant is action performed by the body, then saying that "even while performing prohibited action with visible and invisible purposes through the body, one incurs no evil" would involve a contradiction. And saying that "performing scriptural action with visible and invisible purposes through the body, one incurs no evil" would involve prohibiting what is not obtained.

### B. Analysis of First Objection

1. Logical Structure:
   - If action means "performed by body"
   - Then contradictions arise
   - Both with prohibited and prescribed actions

2. Key Problems:
   - Contradiction with scriptural prohibitions
   - Unnecessary negation of prescribed actions
   - Loss of ethical distinctions

### C. Philosophical Issues

1. Scriptural Coherence:
   - Relation to injunctions
   - Role of prohibitions
   - Systematic integrity

2. Ethical Framework:
   - Distinction of right/wrong
   - Role of bodily action
   - Purpose of restrictions

## IV. Second Pūrvapakṣa Analysis

### A. Text Presentation

#### Sanskrit
'शारीरं कर्म कुर्वन्' इति विशेषणात् केवलशब्दप्रयोगाच्च वाङ्मनसनिर्वर्त्यं कर्म विधिप्रतिषेधविषयं धर्माधर्मशब्दवाच्यं कुर्वन् प्राप्नोति किल्बिषम् इत्युक्तं स्यात् । तत्रापि वाङ्मनसाभ्यां विहितानुष्ठानपक्षे किल्बिषप्राप्तिवचनं विरुद्धम् आपद्येत । प्रतिषिद्धसेवापक्षेऽपि भूतार्थानुवादमात्रम् अनर्थकं स्यात् ।

#### Transliteration

#### Translation
From the qualification "performing bodily action" and the use of the word "only," it would mean that performing action through speech and mind, which is the subject of injunction and prohibition, designated by the terms merit and demerit, one incurs evil. Here too, in the case of performing prescribed actions through speech and mind, the statement about incurring evil would be contradictory. And in the case of engaging in prohibited actions, it would be merely a pointless restatement of what is already known.

### B. Technical Analysis

1. Key Terms and Concepts:
   - vāṅmanasanirvartya: performed through speech and mind
   - vidhipratiṣedhaviṣaya: subject of injunction and prohibition
   - dharmādharmaśabdavācya: designated by terms merit and demerit

2. Logical Structure:
   - If only bodily action is meant
   - Then speech/mind actions would incur evil
   - This leads to further contradictions

### C. Problems Identified

1. Regarding Prescribed Actions:
   - Speech/mind prescribed actions would incur evil
   - This contradicts dharmic principles
   - Makes scriptural injunctions meaningless

2. Regarding Prohibited Actions:
   - Stating they incur evil is redundant
   - Adds nothing to understanding
   - Makes the teaching pointless

## V. Siddhānta Resolution

#### Translation
But when what is meant is action for the mere maintenance of the body, then not performing other action - which has visible and invisible purposes, is known through injunction and prohibition, and is performed through body, speech and mind - but performing, through those very means of body etc., only action for bodily maintenance (as indicated by the word "only"), without the ego-sense of "I am doing," performing mere bodily movement from the worldly perspective, one incurs no evil.

Thus when the meaning of "śārīraṃ kevalaṃ karma" is understood in this way, it becomes free from defect.

### B. Analysis of Resolution

1. Key Elements of Solution:
   - Focus on purpose (śarīrasthitimātra) not means
   - Absence of ego-sense (abhimānavarjita)
   - Integration of all faculties
   - Knowledge as foundation

2. Transcendence of Earlier Problems:
   - Beyond mere physical action
   - Beyond injunction/prohibition duality
   - Beyond karma through knowledge

### C. Technical Framework

1. Critical Terms:
   - śarīrasthitimātraprayojana: purpose only of body maintenance
   - abhimānavarjita: free from ego-sense
   - jñānāgnidagdhasarvakarma: all actions burned by fire of knowledge

2. Structural Elements:
   - Purpose defines action
   - Knowledge transforms action
   - Liberation transcends action

### D. Philosophical Synthesis

1. Integration of Action and Knowledge:
   - Action grounded in knowledge
   - Minimal necessary function
   - Transcendence through understanding

2. Resolution of Contradictions:
   - Purpose over means
   - Knowledge over rules
   - Liberation over bondage

3. Complete Framework:
   - Purpose properly understood
   - Action properly situated
   - Liberation properly achieved
