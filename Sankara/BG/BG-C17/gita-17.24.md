2. **Movement Two**: **Śaṅkara’s Detailed Explanation and Interpretation**
   - Śaṅkara’s Bhāṣya elaborates that by declaring "Om Tat Sat," a threefold directive of Brahman is established.
   - This directive guides Brahmins in their roles, the proper execution of Vedic knowledge, and the performance of sacrifices (*yajña*).

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Threefold Directive ("Om Tat Sat")**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors the Triple Gem (*Buddha, Dharma, Sangha*), providing a structured foundation for ethical and spiritual practices.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with the Yogic Triple Paths (*Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga*), emphasizing structured approaches to self-realization.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the importance of structured ethical guidelines for spiritual advancement.
  - Aligns with Śaṅkara’s Advaita Vedanta, which advocates for disciplined practices and structured instructions to realize the oneness of the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating the Triple Gem and Yogic Triple Paths with Śaṅkara’s threefold directive.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis
