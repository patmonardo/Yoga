अशास्त्रविहितं घोरं तप्यन्ते ये तपो जनाः ।
दम्भाहङ्कारसंयुक्ताः कामरागबलान्विताः ॥५ ॥

अशास्त्रविहितं घोरं न शास्त्रविहितम् अस्मात् शास्त्रेन प्रमाणम् ते कार्येण लिङ्गेन देवादिपूजया सत्त्वादिनिष्ठा अनुमेया इत्याह—
यजन्ते सात्त्विका देवान्यक्षरक्षांसि राजसाः ।

### Transliteration
aśāstravihitaṁ ghoraṁ tapyante ye tapo janāḥ ।
dambhāhaṅkārasamyuktāḥ kāmarāgabalanvitāḥ ॥5 ॥

aśāstravihitaṁ ghoraṁ na śāstravihitam asmāt śāstraena pramāṇam te kāryeṇa liṅgena devādipūjayā sattvādiniṣṭhā anumeyā ityāha—
yajante sāttvikā devānyakṣarakṣāṁsi rājasāḥ ।
pretān bhūtagaṇāṁścānye yajante tāmasā janāḥ ॥5 ॥
```

#### Translation

```markdown
### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that those who perform severe penance not prescribed by the scriptures
do not follow the scriptural authority (*śāstraena pramāṇaṁ*) in their actions (*kāryeṇa*) and ritualistic worship (*liṅgena devādipūjayā*),
thereby lacking steadfastness in goodness (*sattvādiniṣṭhā*).
Such individuals worship gods, Yakshas, and Rakshasas in a Sattvic manner,
while Rajasic individuals worship ghosts and spirits,
and Tamasic individuals worship other demonic beings.
Thus, their misguided worship leads them away from success, happiness, and the supreme destination. ॥5॥

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of performing penance not prescribed by scriptures, coupled with pride and desires, on an individual's spiritual progress and ethical conduct. For example, individuals engaging in unorthodox penances may experience internal conflict and moral dilemmas, hindering their spiritual advancement.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between deviating from scriptural prescriptions and the negative outcomes (failure to attain success, happiness, or liberation). Understanding how pride and desires undermine the purity of actions rationalizes the importance of adhering to established guidelines for spiritual efficacy.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing the deviation from scriptural authority to understanding the consequences of such actions.
  - Investigate how adherence to prescribed penances and worship practices fosters spiritual purity and advancement, while deviations lead to ethical and spiritual degradation.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Misguided Penance**: Compare with Buddhist practices where unskillful actions (akusala kamma) lead to negative karmic outcomes, and Yogic emphasis on disciplined practices for spiritual growth.
  - **Pride and Ego**: Relate to Buddhist teachings on *mana* (pride) and *ahankāra* (ego) as defilements that obstruct spiritual progress, and Yogic concepts of *ahamkara* (ego) hindering self-realization.
  - **Desires and Lust**: Align with Buddhist *rāga* (attachment) and Yogic *kāma* (desire) as binding forces that lead to suffering and impede spiritual liberation.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic nature where proper adherence to scriptural authority aligns individual actions with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight how overcoming pride, ego, and desires purifies the mind, enabling the realization of non-duality and unity with the ultimate reality.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *aśāstravihitaṁ*, *ghoraṁ*, *tapyante*, *dambhāhaṅkārasamyuktāḥ*, *kāmarāgabalanvitāḥ*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Misguided Penance (aśāstravihitaṁ ghoraṁ tapyante)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Similar to engaging in unskillful actions (*akusala kamma*), leading to negative karmic consequences.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with performing practices that are not in accordance with *dharma* (righteousness), leading to imbalance and spiritual stagnation.

  - **Pride and Ego (dambhāhaṅkārasamyuktāḥ)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *mana* (pride) and *ahaṅkāra* (ego), which are defilements that obstruct spiritual progress.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *ahamkara* (ego), hindering self-realization and the dissolution of individuality into the universal consciousness.

  - **Desires and Lust (kāmarāgabalanvitāḥ)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects *rāga* (attachment), a binding force that leads to suffering and prevents liberation.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Relates to *kāma* (desire), which distracts the mind from spiritual pursuits and binds the individual to the material world.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the elimination of pride, ego, and desires as essential for achieving ethical purity and spiritual liberation.
  - The alignment with Śaṅkara’s Advaita Vedanta reinforces the non-dual approach where overcoming these negative traits leads to the realization of the oneness of the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *dambha* (pride) with Buddhist *mana* and Yogic *ahamkara*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where performing penance in alignment with scriptural prescriptions purifies the mind and aligns the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
  - Deviations from scriptural authority, coupled with pride and desires, create dualistic separations, hindering the realization of oneness with Brahman and leading to spiritual stagnation.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how proper adherence to scriptural authority facilitates spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how overcoming pride, ego, and desires through disciplined action and scriptural guidance is essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Actions performed in accordance with scriptural guidelines transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of adhering to scriptural instructions exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**:
  - Integrate insights from the Bhagavad Gītā, Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya, and Buddhist-Abhidharma perspectives to present a comprehensive view of how misguided worship practices impede spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight the interconnectedness of ethical virtues (*daivī sampad*) and the elimination of negative traits (*āsurī sampad*) through adherence to scriptural guidelines in achieving self-realization and harmony with the universe.

- **Systematic Development**:
  - Progress from the identification of misguided worship practices to their philosophical and ethical implications, demonstrating how each aspect contributes to spiritual and moral degradation.
  - Show the transition from recognizing the importance of scriptural authority to understanding the necessity of aligning actions and worship with prescribed guidelines for spiritual advancement.

- **Meaningful Synthesis**:
  - Highlight the convergence of Hindu, Buddhist, and Yogic philosophies in promoting the elimination of negative traits such as pride, ego, and desires through disciplined action and adherence to authoritative teachings.
  - Emphasize how integrated practices from these traditions foster ethical conduct, mental purification, and selfless action, leading to a non-dual understanding of existence and ultimate liberation.
  - Illustrate the practical application of adhering to scriptural guidelines in daily life, contributing to personal growth and societal well-being.
