Sattvic individuals engage in the worship of gods, Yakshas, and Rakshasas; Rajasic individuals worship ghosts and spirits; and Tamasic individuals worship other demonic entities. Thus, the nature (*svabhāva*) of one's faith determines the objects and quality of their worship practices, aligning with the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance. ॥4॥

### IV. Dialectical Structure

1. **Movement One**: **Enumeration of Types of Worship Based on Modes of Faith**
   - The verse delineates how faith (*śraddhā*) manifests in three forms—Sattvic (*sāttvikā*), Rajasic (*rājasāḥ*), and Tamasic (*tāmasāḥ*)—each corresponding to the inherent nature (*svabhāva*) of embodied beings (*dehinām*).
   - **Sattvic Faith (*sāttvikā*)**: Individuals engaged in pure and virtuous worship (*devādipūjayā*), including gods, Yakshas, and Rakshasas.
   - **Rajasic Faith (*rājasāḥ*)**: Individuals worshiping ghosts and spirits, driven by passion and desire.
   - **Tamasic Faith (*tāmasāḥ*)**: Individuals worshiping other demonic entities, influenced by ignorance and delusion.

2. **Movement Two**: **Śaṅkara’s Detailed Explanation and Interpretation**
   - Śaṅkara’s Bhāṣya elaborates that these three forms of faith are products of one's inherent nature, influenced by their karmic engagements and societal conditioning.
   - **Sattvic Faith** is associated with pure and virtuous worship, promoting ethical and spiritual well-being.
   - **Rajasic Faith** is linked to passionate and active worship, which can lead to attachment and moral challenges.
   - **Tamasic Faith** is associated with ignorant and deluded worship, leading to spiritual degradation and ethical obstacles.

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of distinguishing between Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic faith on an individual's behavior and spiritual progress. For instance, individuals with Sattvic faith engage in pure and virtuous worship, promoting personal and societal well-being, while those with Rajasic and Tamasic faith may experience moral and spiritual challenges.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between the types of faith and their outcomes. Understanding how Sattvic faith leads to spiritual advancement, whereas Rajasic and Tamasic faith can lead to ethical and spiritual obstacles rationalizes the importance of cultivating pure faith for spiritual liberation.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing the three forms of faith to understanding their philosophical and ethical implications.
  - Investigate how cultivating Sattvic faith fosters ethical living and spiritual growth, while Rajasic and Tamasic faiths may hinder these processes.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Sattvic Faith (*sāttvikā*)**: Compare with Buddhist *sīla* (ethical conduct) and Yogic *sattva* (purity), emphasizing virtuous and disciplined practices.
  - **Rajasic Faith (*rājasāḥ*)**: Relate to Buddhist *rāga* (attachment) and Yogic *rajas* (passion), highlighting desires and active engagements that can lead to attachment and suffering.
  - **Tamasic Faith (*tāmasāḥ*)**: Align with Buddhist *moha* (delusion) and Yogic *tamas* (ignorance), focusing on delusion and inertia that obstruct spiritual clarity and progress.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic approach where Sattvic faith aligns the individual with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight how overcoming Rajasic and Tamasic faiths purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles, consistent with Advaita Vedanta's non-dual philosophy.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *sāttvikā*, *rājasāḥ*, *tāmasāḥ*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Sattvic Faith (*sāttvikā*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *sīla* (ethical conduct), fostering virtuous and disciplined behavior that leads to spiritual progress.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *sattva* (purity), emphasizing clarity, harmony, and virtuous practices essential for spiritual advancement.

  - **Rajasic Faith (*rājasāḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects *rāga* (attachment), which binds individuals to desires and leads to suffering.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with *rajas* (passion), highlighting active engagement driven by desires and attachment to material pursuits.

  - **Tamasic Faith (*tāmasāḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Aligns with *moha* (delusion), which clouds judgment and impedes spiritual clarity.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *tamas* (ignorance), emphasizing lethargy, delusion, and obstacles to spiritual progress.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the cultivation of ethical conduct and purity (*sīla*, *sattva*) for spiritual advancement.
  - The elimination of attachment (*rāga*, *rajas*) and delusion (*moha*, *tamas*) is essential for achieving spiritual clarity and liberation, aligning with Advaita Vedanta’s emphasis on overcoming negative traits.

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *sāttvikā* with Buddhist *sīla* and Yogic *sattva*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where Sattvic faith aligns the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Rajasic and Tamasic faiths are seen as obstacles that create dualistic separations, hindering the realization of oneness with Brahman.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how different forms of faith influence spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how disciplined action and inner purification, guided by Sattvic faith, are essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Actions performed in accordance with scriptural guidelines transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of adhering to scriptural instructions exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**:
  - Integrate insights from the Bhagavad Gītā, Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya, and Buddhist-Abhidharma perspectives to present a comprehensive view of how different forms of faith influence spiritual liberation.

- **Systematic Development**:
  - Progress from the enumeration of faith's forms to their philosophical implications, demonstrating how each form contributes to spiritual and moral upliftment or degradation.
