# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 20

### Introduction

In the preceding verses, the Lord has described the rare and exalted state of the wise, who, after many births, realize that **Vāsudeva** (the Supreme Lord) is everything and surrender unto Him completely. However, not all individuals reach this realization. In this verse, the Lord explains the reasons why some people, whose understanding is clouded by desires, turn to other deities instead of seeking the ultimate truth in Him.

### Sanskrit

**कामैस्तैस्तैर्हृतज्ञानाः प्रपद्यन्तेऽन्यदेवताः ।
तं तं नियममास्थाय प्रकृत्या नियताः स्वया ॥ २० ॥**

**Commentary:**

*कामैः तैस्तैः पुत्र-पशु-स्वर्ग-आदि-विषयैः हृत-ज्ञानाः अपहृत-विवेक-विज्ञानाः प्रपद्यन्ते अन्य-देवताः प्राप्नुवन्ति वासुदेवात् आत्मनः अन्याः देवताः; तं तं नियमम् देवता-आराधने प्रसिद्धः यः यः नियमः तं तम् आस्थाय आश्रित्य प्रकृत्या स्वभावेन जन्मान्तर-आर्जित-संस्कार-विशेषेण नियताः नियमिताः स्वया आत्मीयया ॥ २० ॥*

## Commentary

**Desires Clouding Knowledge**

- **"Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ"**: Individuals whose discernment has been overshadowed by manifold desires—such as for offspring, livestock, heavenly pleasures, and so on—lose the clarity of understanding. These desires captivate their minds and divert them from seeking the ultimate reality.

**Turning to Other Deities**

- **"Prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ"**: Such people approach other deities that are distinct from **Vāsudeva**, the Supreme Self. They believe that these deities can fulfill their specific material desires.

**Following Specific Practices**

- **"Taṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya"**: They adopt various specific rites and regulations prevalent in the worship of those particular deities. Each deity may have its own set of rituals, and these individuals adhere strictly to them in hopes of attaining their desired results.

**Compelled by Their Own Nature**

- **"Prakṛtyā niyatāḥ svayā"**: Driven by their inherent nature—the dispositions and impressions accumulated from past actions and births—they are bound to follow these paths. Their own innate tendencies dictate their choices, leading them to worship deities aligned with their desires.

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Phenomena vs. Noumena**:

   - **Phenomena**: The desires and material gains represent the world of phenomena—the realm of appearances and sensory experiences.

   - **Noumena**: The Supreme Lord symbolizes the noumenal reality—the thing-in-itself—which is beyond sensory perception.

2. **Moral Law and Rational Will**:

   - Individuals allowing desires to cloud their judgment fail to act according to the moral law dictated by pure practical reason.

   - Surrendering to other deities for material gains reflects heteronomy, where actions are influenced by external factors rather than autonomous moral will.

3. **Ignorance and Enlightenment**:

   - The lack of true knowledge (hṛta-jñānāḥ) parallels Kant's concept of ignorance impeding enlightenment.

### Fichtean Development

1. **The Ego and the Non-Ego**:

   - The individuals are driven by the Non-Ego (external desires and nature) rather than the pure Ego (true self).

2. **Self-Imposed Limitations**:

   - By succumbing to desires, they limit their freedom and bind themselves to external determinations, hindering the realization of the Absolute Ego.

3. **Moral Striving**:

   - True freedom requires overcoming these desires and aligning oneself with the infinite will, moving towards self-realization.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Movement**:

   - **Thesis**: Individuals possess innate desires seeking fulfillment.

   - **Antithesis**: These desires divert them from recognizing the ultimate reality.

   - **Synthesis**: Overcoming desires leads to the realization of the Absolute Spirit.

2. **Master-Slave Dialectic**:

   - The individuals become slaves to their desires and nature (prakṛti), losing autonomy.

   - True mastery is achieved by transcending these limitations and recognizing unity with the Divine.

3. **Progress of Spirit**:

   - The journey involves moving from sense-certainty to self-consciousness and ultimately to absolute knowledge by overcoming the constraints of desires.

## Conclusion

This verse highlights the obstacles that prevent individuals from realizing the ultimate truth of the Supreme Lord's all-encompassing nature. Overpowered by various desires, their knowledge and discernment are clouded, leading them to seek fulfillment through other deities and external rituals. Bound by their own nature and past impressions, they are unable to perceive the underlying unity of existence embodied in **Vāsudeva**.

The Lord emphasizes that while such worship may grant temporary satisfaction, it does not lead to the ultimate goal of liberation and eternal peace. Recognizing and transcending these desires is essential for progressing toward true knowledge and surrender to the Supreme.
