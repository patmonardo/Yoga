# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 25

### Introduction

In the preceding verses, Lord Krishna has been explaining why many people fail to recognize His supreme nature. He has addressed the misconceptions of those who see Him as a finite, manifested being rather than the eternal, unmanifested Supreme. In this verse, He further elaborates on why He remains concealed from the understanding of most people. He explains that due to His divine Yoga-Maya (illusory energy), He is not manifest to everyone, and thus, the deluded do not perceive His unborn and imperishable nature.

### Sanskrit

**तदज्ञानं किं निमित्तम् इत्युच्यते —**

**नाहं प्रकाशः सर्वस्य योगमायासमावृतः ।
मूढोऽयं नाभिजानाति लोको मामजमव्ययम् ॥ २५ ॥**

**Commentary:**

*न अहं प्रकाशः सर्वस्य लोकस्य, केषाञ्चिदेव मद्भक्तानां प्रकाशः अहमित्यभिप्रायः । योगमायासमावृतः योगः गुणानां युक्तिः घटनं सैव माया योगमाया, तया योगमायया समावृतः, संच्छन्नः इत्यर्थः । अत एव मूढो लोकः अयं न अभिजानाति माम् अजम् अव्ययम् ॥*

*यया योगमायया समावृतं मां लोकः नाभिजानाति, नासौ योगमाया मदीया सती मम ईश्वरस्य मायाविनो ज्ञानं प्रतिबध्नाति, यथा अन्यस्यापि मायाविनः मायाज्ञानं तद्वत् ॥ २५ ॥*

### Transliteration

**Tad ajñānaṁ kiṁ nimittam ity ucyate —**

**Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ |
Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam || 25 ||**

**Commentary:**

*Na ahaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya lokasya, keṣāñcid eva mad-bhaktānāṁ prakāśaḥ aham iti abhiprāyaḥ | Yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ yogaḥ guṇānāṁ yuktiḥ ghaṭanaṁ sā eva māyā yoga-māyā, tayā yoga-māyayā samāvṛtaḥ, sañchannaḥ ity arthaḥ | Ata eva mūḍho lokaḥ ayaṁ na abhijānāti mām ajam avyayam ||*

*Yayā yoga-māyayā samāvṛtaṁ māṁ lokaḥ na abhijānāti, na asau yoga-māyā madīyā satī mama īśvarasya māyāvinaḥ jñānaṁ pratibadhnāti, yathā anyasya api māyāvinaḥ māyā jñānaṁ tadvat || 25 ||*

### Translation

**"I am not manifest to everyone, being veiled by My divine Yoga-Maya. This deluded world does not recognize Me as the unborn and imperishable."**

**Commentary:**

"I am not revealed to all beings; I am manifest only to certain devotees of Mine—that is the implication. Covered by Yoga-Maya—'Yoga' means the conjunction or combination of the three Guṇas (qualities), which is Māyā itself; thus, being enveloped by Yoga-Māyā, meaning I am concealed. Therefore, this deluded world does not recognize Me as the unborn and imperishable.

By that very Yoga-Māyā by which I am concealed, the world does not know Me. However, that Yoga-Māyā of Mine, though belonging to Me, the Supreme Lord and wielder of Māyā, does not obstruct My knowledge, just as the illusion created by a magician does not impede the magician's own knowledge."

2. **योगमायासमावृतः (yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ)**

   - **Meaning**: Veiled by Yoga-Māyā.
   - **Context**: 'Yoga-Māyā' refers to the divine illusory power that conceals the true nature of the Lord from those who are deluded.

3. **मूढः अयम् लोकः (mūḍho 'yaṁ lokaḥ)**

   - **Meaning**: This deluded world.
   - **Context**: Refers to people who are ignorant due to the influence of Māyā and thus cannot perceive the Lord's true nature.

4. **न अभिजानाति (na abhijānāti)**

   - **Meaning**: Does not recognize.
   - **Context**: The deluded beings do not know or understand the Lord as He truly is.

5. **माम् अजम् अव्ययम् (mām ajam avyayam)**

   - **Meaning**: Me, the unborn and imperishable.
   - **Context**: Lord Krishna's eternal, unchanging nature that is beyond birth and decay.

6. **योगः गुणानां युक्तिः (yogaḥ guṇānāṁ yuktiḥ)**

   - **Meaning**: Yoga is the combination of the Guṇas (qualities).
   - **Context**: The term 'Yoga' here signifies the conjunction of the three Guṇas—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—which constitute Māyā.

7. **माया (māyā)**

   - **Meaning**: Illusion; the divine power that creates the appearance of the material world.
   - **Context**: Māyā is the Lord's energy that causes beings to perceive the material world as reality, veiling the true nature of the Divine.

### Structural Elements

- **Concealment by Yoga-Māyā**: The Lord explains that He is concealed from the world by His own divine illusion, Yoga-Māyā.

- **Reason for Non-Recognition**: Due to this concealment, deluded beings cannot recognize the Lord's true, unborn, and imperishable nature.

- **Selective Revelation**: The Lord suggests that He reveals Himself only to certain devotees who are free from delusion.

- **Analogy of the Magician**: Just as a magician's illusion does not deceive the magician himself, the Lord's Māyā does not affect His own knowledge.

## Textual Integration

### Connection to Previous Verses

- **Continuation of Theme**: This verse continues the discussion on why people fail to recognize the Supreme Lord. Previously, it was explained that lack of understanding and being deluded by desires lead people to worship other deities and not the Supreme.

- **Nature of Delusion**: Here, the Lord elaborates on the mechanism of delusion—His own Yoga-Māyā—which conceals His true nature from those who are not His devotees.

### Philosophical Implications

- **Māyā as Divine Power**: Māyā is not merely an illusion but a divine power wielded by the Lord to regulate the perception of beings according to their level of consciousness.

- **The Unborn and Imperishable**: Emphasizes the eternal nature of the Lord, who is beyond birth and death, and remains unaffected by the material world's changes.

- **Knowledge and Ignorance**: The distinction between those who perceive the Lord's true nature and those who do not is based on the presence or absence of spiritual knowledge (Vidya) versus ignorance (Avidya).

### Upanishadic Correlation

- **Concept of Brahman**: The Upanishads describe Brahman (the Absolute Reality) as beyond perception, unmanifested, and imperishable. This aligns with the description of the Lord in this verse.

- **Role of Māyā**: Māyā is the cosmic illusion that causes the One to appear as many, concealing the true nature of Brahman from the ignorant.

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Noumenon and Phenomenon**

   - **Noumenon (Thing-in-Itself)**: The Lord's unmanifested, imperishable nature represents the noumenal reality, which is beyond human perception.

   - **Phenomenon**: The material world perceived by the senses, influenced by Māyā, represents the phenomenal reality.

2. **Limits of Human Understanding**

   - **Veil of Māyā**: Just as human cognition is limited and cannot grasp the noumenal directly, beings are unable to perceive the Lord's true nature due to Yoga-Māyā.

3. **Transcendental Illusion**

   - **Delusion of the World**: The world's inability to recognize the Lord parallels Kant's idea of transcendental illusion, where reason leads to misunderstandings about the nature of reality.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego and Individual Ego**

   - **Concealment by Māyā**: The individual ego is separated from the Absolute Ego (the Divine Self) due to the illusion of Māyā.

2. **Overcoming Delusion**

   - **Self-Realization**: Through self-awareness and philosophical inquiry, one can overcome the illusions imposed by Māyā and recognize the unity with the Absolute.

3. **Role of Divine Illusion**

   - **Purpose of Māyā**: The divine illusion serves as a means for the self to evolve and ultimately realize its true nature.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**

   - **Thesis**: The Lord's unmanifested, imperishable nature.

   - **Antithesis**: The world's deluded perception, failing to recognize the Lord.

   - **Synthesis**: Through overcoming Māyā, the individual consciousness unites with the Absolute Spirit.

2. **Absolute Spirit**

   - **Concealment and Revelation**: The process of the Absolute Spirit becoming self-aware involves stages where the divine nature is concealed and then revealed as consciousness evolves.

3. **Māyā as Necessary Illusion**

   - **Progression of Consciousness**: Māyā plays a role in the dialectical unfolding of consciousness, ultimately leading to self-realization.

## Conclusion

In Verse 25, Lord Krishna explains that He remains unmanifested to most people because He is veiled by His divine Yoga-Māyā. This deluded world, under the influence of Māyā, does not recognize Him as the unborn and imperishable Supreme Being. The Lord's true nature is beyond the grasp of those who are deluded by ignorance and attachment to the material world.

The technical analysis highlights key terms and structural elements, emphasizing the role of Yoga-Māyā in concealing the Lord's true nature. The German Idealist perspectives offer philosophical parallels, exploring concepts of noumenon and phenomenon, the limitations of human understanding, and the dialectical process of self-realization.

This verse serves as a reminder of the importance of transcending Māyā through devotion and spiritual knowledge to perceive the true nature of the Divine. It encourages seekers to cultivate purity of mind and sincerity in devotion to overcome the veil of illusion.
