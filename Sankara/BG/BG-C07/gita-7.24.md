# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 24

### Introduction

In the preceding verses, Lord Krishna has explained why some people, driven by desires, worship other deities and attain finite results. He contrasts this with the eternal benefits of devotion to Him. Now, He addresses a misconception held by those who lack true understanding. In this verse, the Lord explains that people who are unintelligent or lacking in wisdom mistake His unmanifested, supreme nature for a manifested, limited form. They do not comprehend His transcendental, imperishable essence.

### Sanskrit

**अव्यक्तं व्यक्तिमापन्नं मन्यन्ते मामबुद्धयः ।
परं भावमजानन्तो ममाव्ययमनुत्तमम् ॥ २४ ॥**

**Commentary:**

*अव्यक्तम् अप्रकाशम् व्यक्तिम् आपन्नम् प्रकाशम् गतम् इदानीम् मन्यन्ते माम् नित्यप्रसिद्धम् ईश्वरम् अपि सन्तम् अबुद्धयः अविवेकिनः । परं भावम् परमात्मस्वरूपम् अजानन्तः अविवेकिनः मम अव्ययम् व्यय रहितम् अनुत्तम् निरतिशयम् मदीयम् भावम् अजानन्तः मन्यन्ते इत्यर्थः ॥ २४ ॥*

### Transliteration

**Avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ manyante mām abuddhayaḥ |
Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto mamāvyayam anuttamam || 24 ||**

**Commentary:**

*Avyaktaṁ aprakāśam vyaktim āpannam prakāśam gatam idānīm manyante mām nitya-prasiddham īśvaram api santam abuddhayaḥ avivekinaḥ | Paraṁ bhāvam paramātma-svarūpam ajānantaḥ avivekinaḥ mama avyayam vyaya-rahitam anuttamam niratiśayam madīyam bhāvam ajānantaḥ manyante ity arthaḥ || 24 ||*

### Translation

**"Unintelligent people, not knowing My supreme, imperishable, and unsurpassable nature, think that I, the unmanifest, have come into manifestation."**

**Commentary:**

"Those who lack discernment (abuddhayaḥ), who are without true understanding, consider Me—the eternally well-known Supreme Lord—even though I exist as unmanifest (avyakta), to have now assumed a manifest (vyakti) form. Not knowing My higher nature (paraṁ bhāvam), which is the essence of the Supreme Self (paramātma-svarūpa), they think in this way. Unaware of My imperishable (avyayam), undecaying, and unsurpassable (anuttamam) nature, they form such misconceptions."

## Commentary (Bhāṣya)

### Sanskrit

**अव्यक्तम् अप्रकाशम् व्यक्तिम् आपन्नम् प्रकाशम् गतम् इदानीम् मन्यन्ते माम् नित्यप्रसिद्धम् ईश्वरम् अपि सन्तम् अबुद्धयः अविवेकिनः । परं भावम् परमात्मस्वरूपम् अजानन्तः अविवेकिनः मम अव्ययम् व्यय रहितम् अनुत्तम् निरतिशयम् मदीयम् भावम् अजानन्तः मन्यन्ते इत्यर्थः ॥ २४ ॥**

### Transliteration

*Avyaktaṁ aprakāśam vyaktim āpannam prakāśam gatam idānīm manyante mām nitya-prasiddham īśvaram api santam abuddhayaḥ avivekinaḥ | Paraṁ bhāvam paramātma-svarūpam ajānantaḥ avivekinaḥ mama avyayam vyaya-rahitam anuttamam niratiśayam madīyam bhāvam ajānantaḥ manyante ity arthaḥ || 24 ||*

### Translation

"Those lacking wisdom (abuddhayaḥ), the undiscerning, think of Me, who am unmanifest (avyaktam)—unseen, not perceivable by the senses—as having now assumed a manifest form (vyaktim āpannam), becoming visible. They consider Me in this way, even though I am the eternally renowned Supreme Lord. Not knowing My supreme nature (paraṁ bhāvam), which is the true form of the Supreme Self (paramātma-svarūpa), and unaware of My imperishable (avyayam), undecaying, unsurpassable (anuttamam) nature, which is beyond all limitations, they think thus—that is the meaning."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Noumenon and Phenomenon**:

   - **Noumenon (Thing-in-Itself)**: The Lord's unmanifested, imperishable nature represents the noumenal reality, which is beyond sensory experience.

   - **Phenomenon**: The manifested forms perceived by the senses are phenomena, which can lead to misconceptions if taken as the ultimate reality.

2. **Limits of Human Understanding**:

   - **Ignorance (Abuddhayaḥ)**: Reflects the limitations of human cognition, which cannot grasp the noumenal without proper discernment.

3. **Transcendental Illusion**:

   - **Misconception of the Divine**: The belief that the unmanifested has become manifested is akin to transcendental illusion, where reason misapplies concepts beyond possible experience.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego and Individual Perception**:

   - **Misidentification**: The individuals mistake the Absolute (the unmanifested Divine) for limited, manifested forms due to their own limited ego.

2. **Need for Intellectual Intuition**:

   - **True Knowledge**: Requires transcending sensory experience to apprehend the Absolute through intellectual intuition.

3. **Overcoming Ignorance**:

   - **Self-Realization**: By recognizing the limitations of perception, one can move toward unity with the Absolute Ego.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The unmanifested Divine reality.

   - **Antithesis**: The perception of the Divine as manifested and limited.

   - **Synthesis**: The realization that the Divine is both immanent and transcendent, uniting the unmanifested and manifested aspects.

2. **Absolute Spirit**:

   - **Misconception as a Stage**: The misunderstanding is a stage in the development of consciousness toward recognizing the Absolute Spirit.

3. **Progression Toward Truth**:

   - **From Sensory Perception to Absolute Knowledge**: The journey involves moving beyond sensory appearances to grasp the ultimate reality.

## Conclusion

In Verse 24, Lord Krishna addresses the misunderstanding held by those who lack true wisdom. These individuals think that the Supreme Lord, who is unmanifested and beyond sensory perception, has now taken a manifest, physical form. They fail to comprehend His imperishable and unsurpassable nature. This misconception arises from ignorance and lack of discernment.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the transcendental nature of the Divine. While the Lord may appear in various forms, His true essence remains unchanging and beyond material manifestation. Understanding this helps devotees deepen their spiritual knowledge and devotion, moving beyond superficial perceptions to grasp the ultimate reality.
