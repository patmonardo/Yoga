# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 28

### Introduction

In the previous verses, Lord Krishna has been explaining why beings, deluded by the dualities of desire and aversion, fail to recognize Him as the Supreme Self. He elaborated on how this delusion arises from birth due to the influence of **Māyā** and the **pairs of opposites** (dvandvas). Now, He describes the characteristics of those rare individuals who have overcome sin and delusion, and who, through righteous actions and purified minds, engage in steadfast devotion to Him. This verse highlights the path to liberation and the importance of purity, virtue, and unwavering commitment in spiritual practice.

### Translation

**"But those persons of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, being freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me with firm resolve."**

**Commentary:**

"Those persons whose sins have come to an end—that is, whose sins are nearly destroyed—who are endowed with virtuous actions that serve as the means to purify the mind (sattva-śuddhi-kāraṇa), they are called 'puṇya-karmaṇaḥ' (doers of good deeds). For such virtuous people, the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites, as previously described, has been eliminated. Being freed from this delusion, they worship Me, the Supreme Self, with firm resolve (dṛḍha-vratāḥ).

'This is indeed the ultimate truth and not otherwise'—with such a firm conviction, and through the vow of renouncing all else, they are called steadfast in their vows (dṛḍha-vratāḥ), possessing determined knowledge."
