## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

ज्ञानं ते तुभ्यम् अहं सविज्ञानं विज्ञानसहितं स्वानुभवयुक्तम् इदं वक्ष्यामि कथयिष्यामि अशेषतः कार्त्स्न्येन । तत् ज्ञानं विवक्षितं स्तौति श्रोतुः अभिमुखीकरणाय — यत् ज्ञात्वा यत् ज्ञानं ज्ञात्वा न इह भूयः पुनः अन्यत् ज्ञातव्यं पुरुषार्थसाधनम् अवशिष्यते नावशिष्टं भवति । इति मत्तत्त्वज्ञो यः, सः सर्वज्ञो भवतीत्यर्थः । अतो विशिष्टफलत्वात् दुर्लभं ज्ञानम् ॥ २ ॥

### Transliteration

*Jñānaṁ te tubhyam ahaṁ sa-vijñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ svānubhava-yuktam idaṁ vakṣyāmi kathayiṣyāmi aśeṣataḥ kārtsnyena. Tat jñānaṁ vivakṣitaṁ stauti śrotuḥ abhimukhīkaraṇāya — yat jñātvā yat jñānaṁ jñātvā na iha bhūyaḥ punaḥ anyat jñātavyaṁ puruṣārtha-sādhanam avaśiṣyate nāvaśiṣṭaṁ bhavati. Iti mat-tattva-jño yaḥ, sa sarvajño bhavatīty arthaḥ. Ato viśiṣṭa-phalatvāt durlabhaṁ jñānam. || 2 ||

### Translation

"To you, I shall declare this knowledge along with realization, accompanied by direct experience, completely and thoroughly. He praises this intended knowledge to engage the listener's full attention: 'By knowing which knowledge, here in this world, nothing further remains to be known—no other means for attaining human goals remains unaccomplished.' Thus, one who knows My true nature becomes omniscient—that is the meaning. Therefore, due to its exceptional result, this knowledge is rare."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Structure**:
   - **Knowledge and Experience**: Reflects Kant's distinction between *a priori* knowledge and empirical experience.
   - **Synthesis of Concepts and Intuitions**: The integration of jñāna and vijñāna parallels the synthesis necessary for true understanding.

2. **Critical Method**:
   - Examines the limits and capacity of human knowledge.
   - Questions how complete knowledge is possible and what faculties are involved.

3. **Systematic Unity**:
   - The idea that knowing the Supreme leads to a unified understanding of all phenomena.
   - Emphasizes the systematic nature of knowledge leading to the cessation of further inquiry.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Self-Positing**:
   - The self strives to know itself fully; in knowing the Absolute, the self reaches complete self-awareness.
   - The act of knowing the Supreme is an act of self-realization.

2. **Dialectical Movement**:
   - **Thesis**: The desire for knowledge.
   - **Antithesis**: The recognition of incomplete knowledge.
   - **Synthesis**: Attainment of complete knowledge that resolves the tension.

3. **Synthetic Unity**:
   - The unification of the subjective self with the objective Absolute.
   - Knowledge and realization together dissolve the separation between knower and known.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Systematic Process**:
   - The progression towards Absolute Knowledge mirrors Hegel's dialectic.
   - The individual consciousness evolves towards knowing the Absolute Spirit.

2. **Concrete Universality**:
   - The specific knowledge of the Supreme encompasses all particular knowledge.
   - The individual experience reflects universal truths.

3. **Absolute Method**:
   - The movement from finite understanding to Absolute Knowledge.
   - The notion that by understanding the Absolute, all contradictions are resolved.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord promises Arjuna the highest knowledge combined with direct experience, assuring that upon realizing this, nothing else remains to be known. This highlights the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit: attaining complete understanding of the Supreme, which encompasses all.

The integration of theoretical knowledge and experiential realization is essential for true wisdom. This aligns with both Eastern philosophies and German Idealist thought, where the synthesis of concepts and experiences leads to absolute understanding.
