## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

दैवी देवस्य मम ईश्वरस्य विष्णोः स्वभावभूता हि यस्मात् एषा यथोक्ता गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया दुःखेन अत्ययः अतिक्रमणं यस्याः सा दुरत्यया। तत्र एवं सति सर्वधर्मान् परित्यज्य मामेव मायाविनं स्वात्मभूतं सर्वात्मना ये प्रपद्यन्ते ते मायाम् एतां सर्वभूतमोहिनीं तरन्ति अतिक्रामन्ति; ते संसारबन्धनात् मुच्यन्ते इत्यर्थः ॥ १४ ॥

### Transliteration

*Daivī devasya mama īśvarasya viṣṇoḥ svabhāva-bhūtā hi yasmāt eṣā yathoktā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā duḥkhena atyayaḥ atikramaṇaṁ yasyāḥ sā duratyayā. Tatra evaṁ sati sarva-dharmān parityajya mām eva māyāvinaṁ svātma-bhūtaṁ sarvātmanā ye prapadyante te māyām etāṁ sarva-bhūta-mohinīṁ taranti atikrāmanti; te saṁsāra-bandhanāt mucyante ity arthaḥ. || 14 ||*

### Translation

"This divine (daivī) illusion (Maya) is the inherent nature of Me, the Supreme Lord, Vishnu. Because it is as described—composed of the gunas—it is My Maya, difficult to overcome (duratyayā), meaning that overcoming it is arduous.

Given this, those who, renouncing all other duties, take refuge in Me alone—the wielder of Maya, who is the very Self—wholeheartedly surrender to Me. They cross over (taranti) this Maya that deludes all beings; that is, they transcend it. They are liberated from the bondage of worldly existence—that is the meaning."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Illusion and Noumenon**:

   - **Maya as Transcendental Illusion**: Just as Kant discusses the limitations of human cognition leading to illusions, Maya represents the illusory perceptions caused by the mind's interaction with the gunas.

   - **Noumenal Reality**: The Lord represents the noumenal realm, beyond sensory experience and Maya.

2. **Limits of Reason**:

   - Human reason alone cannot transcend the illusions imposed by Maya (the phenomenal world).

3. **Moral Law and Faith**:

   - Emphasizes the necessity of faith (surrender to the Lord) to access the noumenal realm and overcome the limitations of human reason.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego and Self-Surrender**:

   - The individual self must surrender to the Absolute Ego (the Lord) to overcome the not-self (Maya).

2. **Moral Action and Freedom**:

   - True freedom is achieved through self-surrender, aligning the individual will with the Absolute.

3. **Overcoming the Finite Self**:

   - By renouncing personal desires and attachments (sarva-dharmān parityajya), the self transcends limitations imposed by Maya.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The individual self entangled in Maya.

   - **Antithesis**: Recognition of the insurmountable nature of Maya through personal effort.

   - **Synthesis**: Surrender to the Absolute Spirit (the Lord), leading to the transcendence of Maya.

2. **Absolute Spirit and Self-Realization**:

   - The realization of the self's unity with the Absolute Spirit occurs through surrender, allowing the self to transcend material limitations.

3. **Freedom through Unity**:

   - True liberation is found in the unity with the Divine, overcoming the alienation caused by Maya.

By renouncing all other attachments and taking refuge in the Lord alone, beings can cross over Maya and attain liberation from the bondage of worldly existence.

The technical analysis highlights the key terms and structural elements, emphasizing the necessity of divine grace and surrender in overcoming Maya.
