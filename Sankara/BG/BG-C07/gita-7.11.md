Balaṁ sāmarthyam ojo balavatāṁ aham, tac ca balaṁ kāma-rāga-vivarjitam, kāmaś ca rāgaś ca kāma-rāgau — kāmaḥ tṛṣṇā asaṁnikṛṣṭeṣu viṣayeṣu, rāgo rañjanā prāpteṣu viṣayeṣu — tābhyāṁ kāma-rāgābhyāṁ vivarjitaṁ dehādi-dhāraṇa-mātrārthaṁ balaṁ sattvam aham asmi; na tu yat saṁsāriṇāṁ tṛṣṇā-rāga-kāraṇam.

### Translation

**"I am the strength of the strong, devoid of desire and attachment. O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), I am the desire in beings that is not contrary to Dharma (righteousness)."**

**Commentary:**

"I am the strength—the capability, vigor—of the strong, and that strength is devoid of desire and attachment. 'Desire' and 'attachment'—these two are: 'Desire' is craving for unattained sense objects; 'Attachment' is affection for sense objects that have been attained. Free from these two—desire and attachment—is the pure strength used merely for sustaining the body and such; that strength (sattva) am I. Not the strength that causes craving and attachment in worldly people. Moreover, the desire in beings that is not contrary to Dharma—that which is not opposed to righteousness and the purpose of the scriptures, such as desire for mere maintenance of the body, related to food and drink—that desire am I, O best of the Bharatas."
