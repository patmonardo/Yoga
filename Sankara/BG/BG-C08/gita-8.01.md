# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Introduction

At the conclusion of Chapter 7, Lord Krishna spoke about how devotees, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the entirety of karma. He mentioned various divine aspects—**Adhibhūta**, **Adhidaiva**, and **Adhiyajña**—and how those who understand these concepts remain united with Him even at the time of death.

Arjuna, seeking clarity on these profound terms and eager to deepen his understanding, poses a series of questions to Lord Krishna at the beginning of Chapter 8. He inquires about the nature of Brahman, the Self, action, and the various divine principles mentioned by the Lord. This sets the stage for a detailed exposition on the nature of the Supreme Reality and the path to attaining it.
