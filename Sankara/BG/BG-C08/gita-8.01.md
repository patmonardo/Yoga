## I. Mūla Verse

### Context
The Lord had previously planted seeds of inquiry in Arjuna's mind through statements like "te brahma tadviduḥ kṛtsnam" (BG 7.29), leading to these questions.

### Sanskrit
'ते ब्रह्म तद्विदुः कृत्स्नम्' (भ. गी. ७ । २९) इत्यादिना भगवता अर्जुनस्य प्रश्नबीजानि उपदिष्टानि । अतः तत्प्रश्नार्थम् अर्जुनः उवाच —

अर्जुन उवाच —
किं तद्ब्रह्म किमध्यात्मं किं कर्म पुरुषोत्तम ।
अधिभूतं च किं प्रोक्तमधिदैवं किमुच्यते ॥ १ ॥
अधियज्ञः कथं कोऽत्र देहेऽस्मिन्मधुसूदन ।
प्रयाणकाले च कथं ज्ञेयोऽसि नियतात्मभिः ॥ २ ॥

### Translation
Following the Lord's implanting of seeds of inquiry through statements like "they know that Brahman completely" (7.29), Arjuna asks:

Arjuna said:
What is that Brahman? What is adhyātma? What is karma, O Supreme Person?
What is declared to be adhibhūta? What is called adhidaiva? || 1 ||
Who and how is adhiyajña here in this body, O Madhusūdana?
And how are You to be known at the time of departure by those of controlled self? || 2 ||
