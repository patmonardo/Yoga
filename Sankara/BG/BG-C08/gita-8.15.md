# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 15

### Introduction

In the preceding verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been guiding Arjuna on the methods to attain the Supreme Being. He emphasized the importance of unwavering devotion, constant remembrance, control of the senses, and meditation on the sacred syllable **Om**. In Verse 14, He assured that those who are always absorbed in Him with exclusive devotion find Him easily attainable. Now, in Verse 15, Lord Krishna explains the ultimate benefit of attaining Him—liberation from the cycle of birth and death, which is characterized by suffering and impermanence. He describes the state of the great souls who, having reached Him, are freed from rebirth in this transient world of misery.

### Translation

**"Having attained Me, the supreme goal, the great souls do not undergo rebirth, which is the place of sorrow and is impermanent."**

**Commentary:**

"Having reached Me ('mām upetya'), the Supreme Lord, and having obtained My nature ('mad-bhāvam āpadya'), they do not attain ('na āpnuvanti') rebirth ('punar janma')—rebirth which is characterized as the dwelling place of miseries ('duḥkhālayam') such as those arising from oneself (ādhyātmika) and others. Not only is it a place of sorrow, but it is also impermanent ('aśāśvatam'), of unstable nature. Such rebirth they do not obtain—those great souls ('mahātmānaḥ'), the ascetics ('yatayaḥ'), who have attained the supreme perfection ('saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ') called liberation ('mokṣa'). Those who do not attain Me return again ('punar āvartante')."
