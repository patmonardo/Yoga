# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 16

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been elucidating the benefits of attaining Him through unwavering devotion and constant remembrance. He emphasized that great souls who reach Him are freed from the cycle of rebirth in this transient and sorrowful world. In Verse 15, He highlighted that upon attaining Him, there is no return to this impermanent abode of suffering.

Now, in Verse 16, Lord Krishna contrasts the impermanence of all worlds, including the highest realms like Brahmaloka, with the permanence of liberation attained by reaching Him. He explains that even the highest heavenly realms are subject to the cycle of birth and death, but those who attain Him transcend this cycle entirely.

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Verse

1. **Ā brahma-bhuvanāt lokāḥ punar āvartinaḥ arjuna**

   - **Ā brahma-bhuvanāt (आ ब्रह्मभुवनात्)**: Up to the realm of Brahmā; including Brahmaloka.
   - **Lokāḥ (लोकाः)**: Worlds; planes of existence.
   - **Punar āvartinaḥ (पुनरावर्तिनः)**: Subject to return; liable to rebirth.
   - **Arjuna (अर्जुन)**: O Arjuna; the recipient of the teaching.

   **Explanation:**

   - All worlds, from the lowest to the highest (including Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā), are impermanent and subject to the cycle of birth and death. Beings who attain these realms through good deeds or austerities eventually exhaust their merit and must return to the cycle of samsāra (worldly existence).

2. **Mām upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate**

   - **Mām upetya (मामुपेत्य)**: Having attained Me; reaching the Supreme Lord.
   - **Tu (तु)**: But; however.
   - **Kaunteya (कौन्तेय)**: O son of Kuntī; Arjuna.
   - **Punar janma na vidyate (पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते)**: Rebirth does not exist; there is no rebirth.

   **Explanation:**

   - In contrast, those who attain the Supreme Lord are liberated from the cycle of birth and death. They do not return to any of the worlds subject to impermanence. Liberation (mokṣa) is eternal and beyond the fluctuations of samsāra.

### Śaṅkarācārya's Commentary

- **Brahmabhuvanāt (ब्रह्मभुवनात्):**

  - 'Bhū' means 'to be'; 'bhuvana' refers to that in which beings exist. 'Brahma-bhuvana' is the abode of Brahmā, known as Brahmaloka.
  - Up to and including Brahmaloka, all realms are places where beings dwell and are thus part of the material creation.

- **Punar āvartinaḥ (पुनरावर्तिनः):**

  - All these worlds are 'punar āvartinaḥ', meaning beings who reside there are subject to return; they undergo rebirth after their merit is exhausted.

- **Mām upetya (मामुपेत्य):**

  - Attaining Me alone, the Supreme Lord, one transcends the cycle of rebirth.

- **Punar janma na vidyate (पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते):**

  - There is no rebirth for those who have realized the Supreme, as they have achieved liberation from samsāra.
