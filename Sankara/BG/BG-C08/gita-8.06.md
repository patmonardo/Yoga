# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 6

### Introduction

In the preceding verse, Lord Krishna emphasized the importance of remembering Him at the time of death to attain His divine state. He assured that anyone who departs while contemplating Him will undoubtedly reach Him. In Verse 6, He extends this principle by explaining that this outcome is not exclusive to those who remember Him alone; rather, whatever one thinks of at the time of death, that very state or being one attains. This verse highlights the profound impact of one's final thoughts on the soul's journey after death and underscores the importance of lifelong practice in shaping one's consciousness.

### Translation

**"Whatever state of being one remembers when he gives up the body at the time of death, O son of Kuntī, that alone does he attain, being ever absorbed in that state."**

**Commentary:**

"This rule is not applicable exclusively to those who contemplate Me. Rather, whatever entity (be it a specific deity or any other object) one thinks of at the time of death—while leaving the body during the final moment of life—one attains that very state, not another, O son of Kuntī. This is because one has been habitually contemplating that state throughout life ('sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ'), and thus becomes absorbed in it."

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Verse

1. **Na mad-viṣaya eva ayaṁ niyamaḥ**

   - **Meaning**: "This rule is not limited to thoughts of Me alone."
   - **Context**: Lord Krishna clarifies that the principle of attaining what one remembers at death applies universally, not just to those who remember Him.

2. **Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram**

   - **Yaṁ yaṁ bhāvaṁ**: "Whatever state or being"—refers to any object of contemplation, such as a deity, person, or desire.
   - **Smaran**: "Remembering" or "thinking of"—the act of contemplation.
   - **Tyajati ante kalevaram**: "Gives up the body at the time of death"—the moment when the soul departs.

3. **Taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya**

   - **Taṁ tam eva eti**: "He attains that very state alone"—the soul reaches the state or being contemplated.
   - **Kaunteya**: "O son of Kuntī"—addressing Arjuna affectionately.

4. **Sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ**

   - **Sadā**: "Always" or "throughout life."
   - **Tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ**: "Being absorbed in that state"—having consistently contemplated or habituated one's mind to that state.

### Explanation

- **Universal Principle**: Lord Krishna explains that the final thought at the time of death determines the next state of existence. This principle is not exclusive to those who think of Him but applies to any object of contemplation.

- **Power of Habitual Contemplation**: The likelihood of thinking of a particular state or being at death is influenced by one's habitual thoughts during life. Continuous contemplation engrains certain patterns in the mind, which surface at the final moment.

- **Attainment of Desired State**: By being consistently absorbed in certain thoughts or desires, one conditions oneself to attain that state after death.

- **Emphasis on Mindfulness**: The verse underscores the importance of being mindful of one's thoughts and the need to cultivate positive and spiritually uplifting contemplations.
