### Translation

**"With a mind made steadfast by the practice of yoga, and not moving toward anything else, one constantly meditates on the Supreme Divine Person. O son of Pṛthā, such a one attains that highest Puruṣa (Person)."**

**Commentary:**

"With a mind engaged in the yoga of constant practice—wherein the mind is dedicated to Me as the object of surrender, and characterized by repeated occurrences of the same thought uninterrupted by thoughts of other kinds—such practice is called 'abhyāsa' (repetition), and that 'abhyāsa' is 'yoga' (spiritual discipline). With that mind, which is thus absorbed in Me, the yogi, using a mind that does not wander toward anything else ('nānya-gāminā'), meaning that his mind is not accustomed to going toward other objects—by that unwavering mind, he meditates on the Supreme, unsurpassed Person, the Divine Being dwelling in the solar orb ('divi sūrya-maṇḍale bhavam'). He reaches (yāti) that Supreme Person, O Pārtha (Arjuna), by contemplating ('anucintayan') the teachings received from scriptures and the teacher."
