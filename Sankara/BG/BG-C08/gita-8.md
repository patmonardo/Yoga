# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Introduction

At the conclusion of Chapter 7, Lord Krishna spoke about how devotees, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the entirety of karma. He mentioned various divine aspects—**Adhibhūta**, **Adhidaiva**, and **Adhiyajña**—and how those who understand these concepts remain united with Him even at the time of death.

Arjuna, seeking clarity on these profound terms and eager to deepen his understanding, poses a series of questions to Lord Krishna at the beginning of Chapter 8. He inquires about the nature of Brahman, the Self, action, and the various divine principles mentioned by the Lord. This sets the stage for a detailed exposition on the nature of the Supreme Reality and the path to attaining it.

### Translation

**The Blessed Lord said:**

**"The Imperishable Supreme is Brahman; one's own nature is called Adhyātma (the Self); the offering which causes the origin of beings is called karma."**

**Commentary:**

"'Akṣara' means 'that which does not decay'—the Imperishable Supreme Self. This is supported by the scripture: 'Under the mighty rule of this Immutable (Akṣara), O Gārgī...' (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.9). The term 'Akṣara' here does not refer to the syllable 'Om,' as later it is specifically qualified in 'Om ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma' (Bhagavad Gita 8.13). The adjective 'paramam' (Supreme) aptly qualifies Brahman, the Immutable.

The very same Supreme Brahman, assuming the state of the inner Self (pratyag-ātma) in each body, is called 'svabhāva'—one's own nature—which is referred to as 'Adhyātma.' The reality that, with reference to the body, functions as the inner Self and ultimately culminates in the Supreme Brahman is called 'svabhāva' and is denoted by the term 'Adhyātma.'

'Bhūta-bhāvodbhava-karaḥ' means 'that which produces the origin of the existence of beings.' 'Bhūta-bhāva' refers to the existence of beings; 'udbhava' is the origin of that existence. That which causes (karaḥ) the origin (udbhava) of the existence (bhāva) of beings (bhūta) is called 'bhūta-bhāvodbhava-karaḥ'—in other words, it is the cause of the creation of physical entities.

'Visarga' refers to the act of offering—specifically, the relinquishment of substances like oblations and offerings (caru, puroḍāśa) to deities. This act of offering, characterized by 'visarga' (relinquishment), is known as 'karma'—that which is designated by the term 'karma' (action). It is from this seed-like offering, through the sequence of rain and so forth, that all movable and immovable beings come into existence."

---

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Terms

1. **Akṣaraṁ Brahma Paramam**

   - **Akṣara (अक्षर)**: Literally means 'imperishable' or 'immutable.' It refers to that which does not decay or change.
   - **Brahma (ब्रह्म)**: The Absolute Reality, the Supreme Cosmic Spirit.
   - **Paramam (परमं)**: Supreme; beyond all limitations.
   - **Interpretation**: The Imperishable Supreme is Brahman, the ultimate reality that is unchanging and eternal.

2. **Svabhāvo 'dhyātmam ucyate**

   - **Svabhāva (स्वभाव)**: One's own nature; inherent disposition.
   - **Adhyātma (अध्यात्म)**: Pertaining to the self; the inner self.
   - **Interpretation**: The inherent nature of an individual, as the inner self, is called Adhyātma.

3. **Bhūta-bhāvodbhava-karo visargaḥ karma-saṁjñitaḥ**

   - **Bhūta-bhāva (भूतभाव)**: The state of being of entities; existence of beings.
   - **Udbhava-karaḥ (उद्भवकरः)**: That which causes the origin.
   - **Visargaḥ (विसर्गः)**: The act of offering; relinquishment.
   - **Karma-saṁjñitaḥ (कर्मसंज्ञितः)**: Known as 'karma' or action.
   - **Interpretation**: The offering that causes the origin of the existence of beings is called 'karma' (action).

### Explanation

- **Brahman as the Imperishable Supreme**: Lord Krishna begins by defining Brahman as the ultimate, unchanging reality that is imperishable. This Brahman is beyond all limitations and is the substratum of all that exists.

- **Adhyātma as One's Own Nature**: The inherent nature of each individual, which is the inner self or soul (Ātman), is referred to as 'Adhyātma.' It is Brahman manifesting as the individual consciousness within each being.

- **Karma as the Creative Action**: 'Visarga,' the act of offering or relinquishment in sacrifices, is designated as 'karma.' This sacrificial action leads to the creation and sustenance of all beings through the cosmic cycle involving rain, food, and procreation.

- **Connection Between Sacrifice and Creation**: The sacrificial offerings made to deities result in rain, which leads to crops, sustenance of life, and continuation of existence. Thus, 'karma' in the form of sacrifice is the cause of the origin and existence of all beings.

### Translation

**"Adhibhūta (the basis of all physical beings) is the perishable nature; the Puruṣa (Cosmic Spirit) is the Adhidaiva (the presiding deity); I alone am the Adhiyajña (Lord of sacrifices) here in this body, O best of embodied beings."**

**Commentary:**

"Adhibhūta refers to that which exists with respect to beings—the perishable nature. What is that? 'Kṣara'—that which decays or perishes—is called 'kṣara.' 'Bhāvaḥ' means any entity that is subject to birth—that is, any mutable, material object.

'Puruṣa' can mean 'one who fills all' (pūrṇam anena sarvam) or 'one who dwells in the city (body)' (puri śayanāt). Here, it refers to Hiraṇyagarbha, situated within the sun (Āditya), who bestows favor upon all the organs of beings. He is the Adhidaiva (presiding deity).

'Adhiyajña' is the deity known as Viṣṇu, who is the presiding Lord of all sacrifices. As the scripture states, 'Yajña (sacrifice) is indeed Viṣṇu' (Taittirīya Saṁhitā 1.7.4). That Viṣṇu is indeed Myself. Here, in this body, I am the Adhiyajña—the Lord of the sacrifice performed in the body. Since sacrifice is carried out by the body and inheres in it, it is based in the body (dehādhikaraṇa), O best of the embodied beings."

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Terms

1. **Adhibhūta (अधिभूतं) — The Perishable Nature**

   - **Kṣaraḥ (क्षरः)**: That which decays or perishes; mutable.
   - **Bhāvaḥ (भावः)**: Any entity possessing birth; material objects.
   - **Interpretation**: Adhibhūta refers to the perishable, ever-changing physical elements—the material nature of the world, encompassing all transient beings and objects.

He emphasized that remembering the Divine leads to attaining the Divine state, while whatever else one thinks of at the moment of death determines one's future state of being. Recognizing the significance of this, Lord Krishna now instructs Arjuna on how to ensure that the mind remains focused on the Divine, not just at the time of death but throughout life. Verse 7 provides practical guidance on maintaining constant remembrance of the Lord while fulfilling one's duties, emphasizing the synthesis of spiritual practice and worldly responsibilities.

### Translation

**"Having attained Me, the supreme goal, the great souls do not undergo rebirth, which is the place of sorrow and is impermanent."**

**Commentary:**

"Having reached Me ('mām upetya'), the Supreme Lord, and having obtained My nature ('mad-bhāvam āpadya'), they do not attain ('na āpnuvanti') rebirth ('punar janma')—rebirth which is characterized as the dwelling place of miseries ('duḥkhālayam') such as those arising from oneself (ādhyātmika) and others. Not only is it a place of sorrow, but it is also impermanent ('aśāśvatam'), of unstable nature. Such rebirth they do not obtain—those great souls ('mahātmānaḥ'), the ascetics ('yatayaḥ'), who have attained the supreme perfection ('saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ') called liberation ('mokṣa'). Those who do not attain Me return again ('punar āvartante')."

# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 16

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been elucidating the benefits of attaining Him through unwavering devotion and constant remembrance. He emphasized that great souls who reach Him are freed from the cycle of rebirth in this transient and sorrowful world. In Verse 15, He highlighted that upon attaining Him, there is no return to this impermanent abode of suffering.

Now, in Verse 16, Lord Krishna contrasts the impermanence of all worlds, including the highest realms like Brahmaloka, with the permanence of liberation attained by reaching Him. He explains that even the highest heavenly realms are subject to the cycle of birth and death, but those who attain Him transcend this cycle entirely.

### Translation

**"From the realm of Brahmā downwards, all worlds are subject to return, O Arjuna. But having attained Me, O son of Kuntī, one does not take birth again."**

---

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Verse

1. **Ā brahma-bhuvanāt lokāḥ punar āvartinaḥ arjuna**

   - **Ā brahma-bhuvanāt (आ ब्रह्मभुवनात्)**: Up to the realm of Brahmā; including Brahmaloka.
   - **Lokāḥ (लोकाः)**: Worlds; planes of existence.
   - **Punar āvartinaḥ (पुनरावर्तिनः)**: Subject to return; liable to rebirth.
   - **Arjuna (अर्जुन)**: O Arjuna; the recipient of the teaching.

   **Explanation:**

   - All worlds, from the lowest to the highest (including Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā), are impermanent and subject to the cycle of birth and death. Beings who attain these realms through good deeds or austerities eventually exhaust their merit and must return to the cycle of samsāra (worldly existence).

2. **Mām upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate**

   - **Mām upetya (मामुपेत्य)**: Having attained Me; reaching the Supreme Lord.

   **Explanation:**

   - In contrast, those who attain the Supreme Lord are liberated from the cycle of birth and death. They do not return to any of the worlds subject to impermanence. Liberation (mokṣa) is eternal and beyond the fluctuations of samsāra.

### Śaṅkarācārya's Commentary

- **Brahmabhuvanāt (ब्रह्मभुवनात्):**

  - 'Bhū' means 'to be'; 'bhuvana' refers to that in which beings exist. 'Brahma-bhuvana' is the abode of Brahmā, known as Brahmaloka.
  - Up to and including Brahmaloka, all realms are places where beings dwell and are thus part of the material creation.

- **Punar āvartinaḥ (पुनरावर्तिनः):**

  - All these worlds are 'punar āvartinaḥ', meaning beings who reside there are subject to return; they undergo rebirth after their merit is exhausted.

- **Mām upetya (मामुपेत्य):**

  - Attaining Me alone, the Supreme Lord, one transcends the cycle of rebirth.

- **Punar janma na vidyate (पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते):**

  - There is no rebirth for those who have realized the Supreme, as they have achieved liberation from samsāra.

# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 17

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been explaining the impermanence of all worlds within the material realm, including the highest abode of Brahmā (Brahmaloka). He emphasized that even those who reach these exalted realms are subject to the cycle of birth and death, and only by attaining Him can one escape this cycle. In Verse 16, He stated that those who reach Him do not undergo rebirth.

Now, in Verse 17, Lord Krishna elaborates on why even Brahmaloka and other higher realms are impermanent. He introduces the concept of cosmic time, explaining the immense durations of Brahmā's day and night, and how the cycle of creation and dissolution operates within these vast time frames. This verse underscores the temporal nature of all material existence, reinforcing the need to seek the eternal Supreme.

   **Explanation:**

   - Even Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā, is bound by time and thus impermanent. Therefore, all worlds, including Brahmaloka, are subject to the cycle of creation and dissolution, making beings who reach there subject to return.

### Śaṅkarācārya's Commentary

- **Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇaḥ viduḥ**

# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 18

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been elucidating the impermanent nature of all material worlds, including the highest realm of Brahmā (Brahmaloka). He explained the vast durations of Brahmā's day and night, each consisting of one thousand yugas, and how all beings within these realms are subject to the cycles of creation and dissolution. In Verse 17, He highlighted that despite the immense scale of cosmic time, these realms are still impermanent and bound by time.

Now, in Verse 18, Lord Krishna further elaborates on the process of cosmic creation and dissolution that occurs during Brahmā's day and night. He explains how all beings manifest from the unmanifest at the onset of Brahmā's day and return to the unmanifest state at the onset of his night. This verse underscores the cyclical nature of the universe and the transient existence of all beings within the material realm.

### Translation

**"From the unmanifest, all the manifest beings come forth at the arrival of day; at the arrival of night, they dissolve into that same unmanifest, which is called the unmanifest."**

---

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Verse

1. **Avyaktāt vyaktayaḥ sarvāḥ prabhavanti ahar-āgame**

   - **Avyaktāt (अव्यक्तात्):** From the unmanifest; the unmanifested state.
   - **Vyaktayaḥ (व्यक्तयः):** The manifest beings; all manifested entities.
   - **Sarvāḥ (सर्वाः):** All.
   - **Prabhavanti (प्रभवन्ति):** Come forth; manifest.
   - **Ahar-āgame (अहरागमे):** At the arrival of day; when Brahmā's day begins.

   **Explanation:**

   - At the beginning of Brahmā's day (cosmic dawn), all beings emerge from the unmanifest state into the manifest world. The unmanifest ('avyakta') refers to the subtle, undifferentiated state of prakṛti (primordial nature) during cosmic dissolution.

2. **Rātry-āgame pralīyante tatra eva avyakta-saṁjñake**

   - **Rātry-āgame (रात्र्यागमे):** At the arrival of night; when Brahmā's night begins.
   - **Pralīyante (प्रलीयन्ते):** Dissolve; merge back.
   - **Tatra eva (तत्र एव):** There itself; into that very same.
   - **Avyakta-saṁjñake (अव्यक्तसंज्ञके):** Called the unmanifest; known as the unmanifest.

   **Explanation:**

   - At the onset of Brahmā's night (cosmic dusk), all manifest beings dissolve back into the unmanifest state. The cycle repeats with each cosmic day and night.

### Śaṅkarācārya's Commentary

- **Avyaktāt avyaktam prajāpateḥ svāpāvasthā**

  - 'Avyakta' refers to the unmanifest state, which is Brahmā's state of sleep (svāpa-avasthā) during cosmic dissolution.

- **Tasmat avyaktāt vyaktayaḥ vyajyante**

  - From that unmanifest state, the manifest beings ('vyaktayaḥ') emerge. These include all stationary (sthāvara) and moving (jaṅgama) entities—plants, animals, humans, etc.

- **Ahar-āgame brahmaṇaḥ prabodha-kāle**

  - At the arrival of Brahmā's day, during his awakening, the creation manifests.

- **Rātry-āgame brahmaṇaḥ svāpa-kāle pralīyante**

  - At the onset of Brahmā's night, during his sleep, all beings dissolve back into the unmanifest state.

- **Tatra eva pūrvokte avyakta-saṁjñake**

  - They merge into that very same unmanifest state previously mentioned, which is called 'avyakta'.

## Philosophical Analysis

### The Cycle of Samsāra

- **Macrocosmic Samsāra**

  - The concept of samsāra (cycle of birth and death) is extended to the entire universe, not just individual beings.

- **Eternal Return**

  - The repetitive cycles suggest an endless loop, emphasizing the need to seek liberation from this cycle.

### Impermanence and Suffering

- **Transience as Source of Suffering**

  - The impermanent nature of the universe leads to attachment and suffering, reinforcing the importance of seeking the eternal.

### The Unmanifest and the Manifest

- **Prakṛti and Purusha**

  - The unmanifest prakṛti is the source of the manifest universe, but it is insentient. The ultimate reality is beyond both manifest and unmanifest.

### Liberation (Mokṣa)

- **Transcending the Cycle**

  - By realizing the Supreme Being, one can transcend this cosmic cycle of creation and dissolution.

---

## Conclusion

Verse 18 of Chapter 8 highlights the cyclical nature of the universe and the impermanence of all manifested beings:

- **Cyclical Creation and Dissolution**

  - All beings emerge from the unmanifest at the beginning of Brahmā's day and dissolve back into it at the onset of his night.

- **Impermanence of Manifestation**

  - The manifest world is transient, continually undergoing cycles of birth and dissolution.

- **Encouragement to Seek the Eternal**

  - Understanding the temporary nature of material existence motivates seekers to pursue the eternal reality of the Supreme Being.

This verse reinforces the earlier teachings about the impermanence of the material world and the importance of attaining the Supreme to achieve liberation from the cosmic cycle.
