**Verse 23 (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 8)**

**Sanskrit Text:**

यत्र काले त्वनावृत्तिमावृत्तिं चैव योगिनः ।
प्रयाता यान्ति तं कालं वक्ष्यामि भरतर्षभ ॥ २३ ॥

**Transliteration:**

**Yatra kāle tv anāvṛttim āvṛttiṁ caiva yoginaḥ |
Prayātā yānti taṁ kālaṁ vakṣyāmi bharatarṣabha || 23 ||**

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**

- **Yatra kāle (यत्र काले):** At which time.
- **Tu (तु):** But; however.
- **Anāvṛttim (अनावृत्तिम्):** Non-return; no coming back to samsāra.
- **Āvṛttim (आवृत्तिम्):** Return; coming back again to the cycle of birth and death.
- **Ca (च):** And, also.
- **Eva (एव):** Indeed.
- **Yoginaḥ (योगिनः):** Yogis; here it may include both spiritual practitioners with knowledge and those who follow the path of action, as clarified by commentary.

**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Yatra kāle…tv anāvṛttim āvṛttiṁ caiva yoginaḥ prayātā yānti"**: This verse sets the stage for describing the conditions (specifically times or paths) under which departing yogis either do not return to the cycle of rebirth (anāvṛtti) or do return (āvṛtti).

- Śaṅkara clarifies that the term **"yoginaḥ"** here includes not just those established in higher yoga but also *karmiṇaḥ* (those engaged in Vedic rites and sacrificial actions) who are considered yogins by virtue of their alignment with dharma and spiritual practice. He refers back to the Gita’s previous usage: *"karmayogena yoginām"* (Gita 3.3), suggesting that various categories of spiritual practitioners are broadly called yogins.

- **"Prayātāḥ"**: means those who have died, "departed" from the body. The verse states that depending on the "kāla" (time/path) they leave the body, these practitioners either go to a state of non-return (liberation) or return again into the cycle of birth and death.

- **"Taṁ kālaṁ vakṣyāmi"**: Lord Krishna promises to explain these different time factors or conditions that determine whether there is a return to samsāra or a final liberation.

**Purpose of Introducing Kāla (Time/Path):**

In the following verses, Krishna will detail the bright and dark paths that souls may follow upon death. The bright (uttarāyaṇa) path leads to non-return (no rebirth), and the dark (dakṣiṇāyaṇa) path leads to return. By introducing the concept of "kāla" here, He sets the stage to delineate these two pathways and their outcomes.

---

**Philosophical Context:**

- This verse indicates that even among those who practice yoga or virtuous activities, the result after death can differ based on the time or conditions at departure.

- The upcoming verses (8.24-8.26) will specify these times or paths. One path leads to final liberation—no more entanglement in birth and death. The other leads back into the cosmic cycle.

- This teaching aligns with the Gita’s broader theme: even spiritual practitioners must understand subtleties—like the path of light and path of darkness—if they aim for final liberation rather than heavenly enjoyment followed by return.

- On a deeper level, while times and paths are presented, the ultimate point is to show that the dedicated and knowledgeable devotee (especially one who attains true realization) transcends these time-bound conditions. Nevertheless, Krishna teaches these details to encourage understanding and proper orientation of spiritual effort.

---

**Practical Implications:**

- The verse prepares the seeker to learn about these specific cosmic conditions that influence post-death trajectories. Understanding these helps one plan their spiritual life, ensuring constant remembrance of the Lord, devotion, and correct timing or mental state at death.

- While from a higher standpoint, pure knowledge of Brahman or unwavering devotion to the Supreme eventually overcomes all conditionalities, for the aspirant still navigating subtle differences, these teachings serve as valuable guideposts.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

We have learned about cosmic cycles, impermanence of worlds, and the need for unwavering devotion. Now the Gita adds another dimension: the recognition that even the conditions at death (times/paths) matter. This nuance encourages the practitioner to maintain spiritual vigilance throughout life, ensuring a suitable mental and spiritual condition at life’s end.

Ultimately, the teaching points beyond these conditions, hinting that full realization (merging with Brahman, the Supreme) transcends all. But first, the student must understand these intermediate distinctions to appreciate the complexity of samsāra and the grace in attaining the Supreme Lord beyond such conditions.

---

**Conclusion:**

Verse 23 introduced that Krishna would explain the times leading to no return or return. Verse 22 established the Supreme to be gained by devotion. Verse 21 clarified that Supreme as the ultimate imperishable Brahman. Now Verse 23 sets the scene for a detailed account of paths and times, and Verse 24 onwards will provide these details. This Verse 23 is a transitional verse, preparing us for the explanation of the bright and dark paths of departure that determine the soul’s future fate.
