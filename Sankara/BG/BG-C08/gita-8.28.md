**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Vedeṣu yajñeṣu tapaḥsu caiva dāneṣu yat puṇya-phalam pradiṣṭam"**:
  The scriptures promise various types of meritorious fruits for those who study the Vedas faithfully, perform prescribed sacrifices, undertake rigorous austerities, and engage in generous acts of charity. Each of these activities is known to yield positive karmic results, leading one to heavenly realms or better conditions in future births.

- **"Atyeti tat sarvam idaṁ viditvā"**:
  The yogi, after understanding all that has been taught previously (notably the seven questions posed by Arjuna at the start of the chapter, and the distinction between the two paths—no-return and return, the nature of Brahman, and the way to attain it), surpasses all these finite results. The yogi’s knowledge and practice lead them beyond any limited fruit that comes from ritual actions or meritorious deeds. They no longer are confined to enjoying rewards and then returning to samsāra.

- **"Yogī paraṁ sthānam upaiti cādyam"**:
  By following the methods taught—devotion, Om meditation, understanding the impermanent nature of worlds, and aligning one’s consciousness with the Supreme—the yogi reaches the ultimate abode. "Paraṁ sthānam" means the supreme place, which is none other than the highest Brahman.
  "Ādyam" (primeval) indicates that this Supreme Brahman is the original cause, the first and foremost principle that precedes all creation. It’s the fundamental reality beyond time, space, and all cosmic cycles.

Śaṅkara notes that the entire subject matter—dealing with cosmic impermanence, distinguishing paths of no-return and return, and understanding Om and Brahman—culminates here. The yogi who fully assimilates this knowledge and puts it into practice (through unwavering devotion and meditation) surpasses the limitations of lesser spiritual goals (like heavenly enjoyment) and directly attains the eternal Brahman.

He also points out that those who have perfect insight do not go anywhere at death. They are instantly one with Brahman. However, for the general aspirant, the Gita has provided a roadmap: even if they start from karma and upāsanā, by absorbing these teachings and integrating them, they surpass all finite fruits and reach the infinite.

**Philosophical Context:**

- **Beyond Karmic Fruits:**
  The verse emphasizes that worldly and even Vedic scriptural promises of merit are all within the domain of samsāra. The yogi, through knowledge and direct realization, transcends these finite results.

- **Integration of Knowledge and Devotion:**
  The teachings given have shown that mere good deeds lead to heaven but not liberation, and that direct devotion and knowledge lead beyond. Realizing Brahman surpasses any finite gain imaginable from ritualistic or meritorious acts.

- **Attainment of the Supreme Abode:**
  This is consistent with the Upanishadic vision of Brahman as the sole eternal reality. The ultimate abode is "Primeval" (ādyam), indicating it's the root-source of all existence. Once there, no return is possible.

---

**Practical Implications:**

For the seeker:

- No matter how much good karma one accumulates, all are inferior to realizing Brahman.
- Understanding and practicing unwavering devotion, correct meditation, and insight into Brahman’s nature frees one from all temporary results and leads straight to liberation.

This verse is a call to focus on the ultimate spiritual achievement rather than settling for partial successes.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

We have journeyed from understanding impermanence, acknowledging two eternal paths, learning about Om and devotion, and grasping that ultimate liberation surpasses all worldly and heavenly results. Now, the Gita concludes this chapter by confirming that the true yogi, who comprehends all these teachings (thus "viditvā"), surpasses every finite religious fruit and attains the Supreme Brahman—the final end of the Path to the Supreme.

**Conclusion:**

Verse 28 (note: The actual Gita numbering: this is Verse 28 in some recensions or Verse 28 is the last verse of chapter 8. The user’s posted text "अत्येति तत्सर्वमिदं..." matches Gita 8.28 in the standard numbering, but they said "Mantra 28." Actually, the user posted "मम ॥ २१ ॥" previously and we have moved along. The last verse they posted is Verse 28 indeed) states that by knowing and practicing what has been taught—the reality of Brahman and the ways to attain it—the yogi surpasses all the finite fruits promised by the Vedas and other spiritual disciplines. Instead, they achieve the Supreme Primeval Abode, Brahman itself, thereby completing the instructions of this chapter.
