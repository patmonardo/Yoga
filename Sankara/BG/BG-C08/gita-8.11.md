### Translation

**"That which the knowers of the Vedas declare as the Imperishable, which the self-controlled, desire-free ascetics enter, and desiring which they practice celibacy— that goal (state) I shall briefly explain to you."**

**Commentary:**

"That Imperishable ('akṣaraṁ'), which does not decay ('na kṣarati')—the Indestructible Reality—the knowers of the Vedas ('vedavidaḥ'), those who understand the meaning of the Vedas, declare. As the scripture says, 'That, indeed, is the Imperishable, O Gārgī, which the brāhmaṇas describe' (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.8), and they describe it by negating all specific attributes, such as 'It is neither gross nor subtle' and so on.

Furthermore, that which the self-controlled ascetics ('yatayaḥ'), who are given to striving and are renunciates, free from desire ('vīta-rāgāḥ')—from whom attachment ('rāga') has departed—enter upon the attainment of true knowledge.

And desiring to know that Imperishable ('akṣaram icchantaḥ'), they practice celibacy ('brahmacaryaṁ caranti') under the guidance of a teacher.

That goal ('padaṁ'), called the Imperishable ('akṣara'), which is worthy of being attained, I shall explain to you in brief ('saṅgraheṇa'), in summary."
