**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **Deities of Time and Path:**
  The verse enumerates a series of conditions—Agni (fire), Jyotiḥ (light), Ahaḥ (daytime), Śukla (the bright fortnight), and the six months of Uttarāyaṇa (the northern course of the sun). Each of these terms corresponds to a particular deity or devatā associated with that time. These aren't merely times of day or year; they represent auspicious paths or channels presided over by certain deities.

- **"Agniḥ jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ ṣaṇ-māsā uttarāyaṇam"**:
  Each factor—Agni, Jyoti, Daytime, Bright half of month, and Uttarāyaṇa—constitutes a segment of the path that leads beyond return. They symbolize a "bright" or "luminous" route departing souls can traverse. Śaṅkara suggests this is not arbitrary; the text and traditional understanding treat these phases as devatā-enabled gateways.

- **Departing in that Path:**
  "Tatra prayātāḥ" means those who depart (die) during these conditions. However, it's not merely about physical time of death. The key is that these conditions or paths are indicative of a certain spiritual attainment or alignment. The practitioners who qualify for this route are those with firmly established understanding and meditation on Brahman.

- **Brahma-vido janāḥ:**
  The verse calls them Brahmavidaḥ (knowers of Brahman) or Brahmopāsakāḥ (those who have devoted themselves to Brahman meditation). These are not ordinary souls; they have practiced Upāsanā on Brahman, possibly including meditation on Om, devotion to the Supreme, and cultivation of spiritual insight. By departing along this "bright path," they ascend gradually (kramena, as Śaṅkara notes) to Brahmaloka and beyond, eventually attaining Brahman.

- **Kramamukti vs. Sadyo-mukti:**
  Śaṅkara notes that those who have direct knowledge (samyag-darśana) and are completely established in Brahman may not need to travel any path at all; they achieve immediate (sadyo) liberation. For them, there's no journey or intermediate stop. The verse, however, refers to those Brahman-upāsakas who may follow the path of gradual liberation (kramamukti). They ascend through stages after death, guided by these luminous routes, eventually reaching Brahman.

- **These Conditions as Path-Deities:**
  It's implied that each condition is presided over by a particular deity that guides the soul upward. The reasoning is: Just as Om and devotion form a metaphysical path, these bright conditions constitute a subtle metaphysical route favored by those who have practiced Brahman-upāsanā but may not have attained immediate realization in life.

**Śaṅkara’s Key Point:**
There’s a subtlety: Perfect knowers of Brahman (sadyo-mukta) do not travel anywhere—"na tasya prāṇā utkramanti" (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.6) states that for them, no upward journey or path is needed, as they are merged in Brahman immediately. This verse describes those who have Brahman as their object of worship but still rely on cosmic conditions and channels after death to reach Brahman gradually. They do achieve non-return (no more rebirth) after ascending through the bright path.

---

**Philosophical Context:**

- **The Bright Path (Archi-rāṇa Marg)**:
  Traditionally, the Gita and Upanishads mention two paths: the bright path (uttarāyaṇa, through fire, light, day, bright fortnight, six months of northern solstice) for those who do not return, and the dark path (dakshiṇāyana) for those who return. This verse is setting up the explanation of that bright path.

- **Gradual Liberation (Krama-Mukti):**
  The bright path leads to Brahmaloka, and from there, after experiencing the presence of the Creator (Hiraṇyagarbha or Brahmā), the soul attains Brahman at the end of Brahmā’s tenure without returning to samsāra.

- **Importance of Brahma-Vidyā (Knowledge of Brahman):**
  Only those established in Brahman meditation can make use of this bright path. This encourages aspirants to develop constant devotion, upāsanā, and knowledge.

---

**Practical Implications:**

- For spiritual seekers who haven’t attained immediate enlightenment, adherence to Vedic injunctions, devotion, and meditation on Brahman or Om ensures that at death they may follow the bright route to eventual liberation. This route depends on prior spiritual preparation and the individual's spiritual grade at death.

- While ultimate realization (sadyo-mukti) surpasses any path or time condition, the scripture provides these methods for those still navigating karmic conditions and requiring a structured route to liberation.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

After discussing impermanence and cosmic cycles, the Gita now introduces the bright and dark paths that departed souls may follow. Verse 24 and subsequent verses will detail these routes. Verse 23 said Krishna would explain these times/paths. Verse 24 is the beginning of that explanation, focusing on the bright path conducive to Brahman realization for Brahma-vido janāḥ. Thus, we see how the Gita’s teachings unify devotion, knowledge, correct timing (or alignment), and higher meditation into a coherent spiritual roadmap culminating in final liberation.

**Conclusion:**

Verse 24 (in original numbering of Gita, it’s Verse 24 that details bright path—The user provided Verse 23 previously, now Verse 24 is given) underscores that the Supreme Person is attained by specific route: those who depart during the bright path associated with fire, light, day, bright half of the month, and the northern solstice (Uttarāyaṇa) reach Brahman. They are Brahma-vido janāḥ who, due to their Brahman-upāsanā and the cosmic conditions at death, travel this luminous route towards final emancipation, never to return to samsāra.
