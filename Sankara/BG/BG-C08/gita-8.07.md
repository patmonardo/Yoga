# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 7

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been explaining the profound impact of one's thoughts at the time of death on the soul's subsequent journey. He emphasized that remembering the Divine leads to attaining the Divine state, while whatever else one thinks of at the moment of death determines one's future state of being. Recognizing the significance of this, Lord Krishna now instructs Arjuna on how to ensure that the mind remains focused on the Divine, not just at the time of death but throughout life. Verse 7 provides practical guidance on maintaining constant remembrance of the Lord while fulfilling one's duties, emphasizing the synthesis of spiritual practice and worldly responsibilities.

**Commentary:**

"Since the final thought at the time of death is the cause for attaining another body, therefore, at all times, remember Me as prescribed by the scriptures. And fight—perform your duty of warfare as per your own dharma. Having your mind and intellect dedicated to Me—fixing your mental and intellectual faculties on Vāsudeva—you, thus being one whose mind and intellect are offered to Me, will come to Me alone as remembered. There is no doubt (asaṁśayaḥ) in this matter."
