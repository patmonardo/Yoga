### Translation

**"For those whose minds are always absorbed in Me, who constantly remember Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O Pārtha (Arjuna), because they are always engaged in devotion to Me."**

**Commentary:**

"He whose mind is not on any other object ('ananya-chetāḥ'), whose mind is not directed toward anything else—such a yogi constantly ('satatam') remembers Me, the Supreme Lord ('parameśvaraṁ smarati nityaśaḥ'). 'Satatam' denotes uninterruptedness, and 'nityaśaḥ' signifies over a long period of time—not for six months or a year, but throughout one's life without interruption ('yāvaj-jīvaṁ nairantaryeṇa'). For such a yogi, I am easy to attain ('sulabhaḥ'), O Pārtha, because he is always united with Me ('nitya-yuktasya yoginaḥ')—his mind is always focused and absorbed in Me. Therefore, being of single-minded devotion, one should always remain absorbed in Me."
