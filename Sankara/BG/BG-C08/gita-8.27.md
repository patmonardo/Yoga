**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Naite sṛtī… muhyati kaścana"**: Having learned about the two eternal paths—the bright route leading to liberation (no-return) and the dark route leading to return (rebirth)—the yogi (one who understands and practices the teachings) is never deluded. The confusion arises if one does not comprehend these paths and their outcomes. But with proper knowledge, the yogi clearly understands which path leads to non-return and which to return, thus not falling into misunderstanding or error.

- **"Tasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu yoga-yukto bhava Arjuna"**: Therefore, armed with this understanding, Arjuna is instructed to remain united with yoga at all times. "Sarveṣu kāleṣu" implies that there is no specific time when spiritual vigilance can be relaxed; one must maintain yoga (integration, devotion, constant remembrance) continuously.

Śaṅkara stresses that understanding these paths removes doubts and confusion, providing clarity of purpose. Since the ultimate liberation depends on unwavering spiritual engagement and correct orientation at death, continuous yoga practice ensures proper alignment, devotion, and eventual attainment of the Supreme.

---

**Philosophical Context:**

- **End of the Discussion on Paths**: With Verse 27, Lord Krishna concludes the explanation of the two eternal paths. After describing their nature (verses 24-26), He reassures that mere knowledge of these paths—and thus their implications—is enough for a yogi to avoid delusion.

- **Importance of Constant Practice**: Knowledge alone is insufficient without applying it through continuous yogic discipline. Therefore, Krishna instructs Arjuna to be "yoga-yuktaḥ," meaning constantly engaged in the integrative spiritual practice that includes devotion, meditation, moral discipline, and discrimination between the ephemeral and the eternal.

- **From Knowledge to Steadfast Yoga**: Awareness of cosmic conditions and ultimate goals transforms into practical advice for daily living: remain always aligned with yoga. This ensures that when life’s final moments come, the yogi’s mind naturally takes the bright route (the path of no return).

---

**Practical Implications:**

- **No Delusion**: Knowing the metaphysical mechanics of the universe’s departure paths frees the practitioner from confusion about death’s outcome. The yogi does not fear or misunderstand death.

- **Continuous Spiritual Effort**: Constant engagement with yogic principles—steadiness of mind, devotion to the Supreme, and purity of life—assures a harmonious conclusion and liberation.

- **Confidence in Spiritual Knowledge**: Understanding the cosmic law behind these paths instills confidence and resolve. The yogi knows precisely why continuous yoga practice and devotion are critical.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

Up to this point, the Gita explained impermanence, introduced two paths, and showed that knowledge combined with constant practice leads beyond confusion. This verse states that with understanding, the yogi avoids delusion and is encouraged to remain ceaselessly engaged in yoga. This unwavering engagement ensures the yogi’s eventual attainment of the Supreme. Thus, the verse reinforces that correct knowledge plus sustained effort in yoga paves the way to the highest realization.

---

**Conclusion:**

Verse 27 concludes the teaching on the two paths by stating that understanding them prevents confusion. Since correct knowledge eliminates delusion, the yogi can focus on the continuous practice of yoga. This aligns the practitioner’s life entirely with the pursuit of the Supreme, setting the stage for final liberation.
