# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

### Introduction

In the preceding verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been guiding Arjuna on the methods to attain the Supreme Brahman, especially at the time of death. He described the attributes of the Supreme Being and emphasized the importance of unwavering devotion, disciplined practice, and meditation.

### Translation

**"Having restrained all the gates of the body, and confined the mind within the heart, drawing the life force to the head, established in yoga concentration..."**

**Commentary:**

"Restraining all the doors ('sarva-dvārāṇi saṁyamya')—that is, controlling all the senses through which one perceives the external world—confine the mind within the lotus of the heart ('manaḥ hṛdi nirudhya'), making it motionless and free from external engagements. Then, using the controlled mind, guide the life force (prāṇa) upwards through the central channel (suṣumṇā), ascending from the heart and placing it at the crown of the head ('mūrdhni ādhāya ātmanaḥ prāṇam'). Having thus commenced, the yogi engages in the concentration of yoga ('āsthitaḥ yoga-dhāraṇām'), preparing to meditate upon the Supreme."
