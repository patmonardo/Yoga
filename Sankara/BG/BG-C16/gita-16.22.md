### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that those who are freed by these three doors of hell — the doors of darkness, suffering, and delusion, driven by desires (*kāmādayaḥ*) — continue to act and persist in their actions.
What is their purpose? The benefit of the self (*ātmanah śreyasaḥ*).
Having not acted previously (*pūrvaṁ na ācachāra*), they begin to act (*tadapagamāt ācachati*).
From that action (*tadācaraṇāt*), they attain the supreme path (*parāṁ gatim*), even moksha (liberation). ॥22॥

### IV. Dialectical Structure

1. **Movement One**: **Enumeration of Demoniac Traits and Their Manifestations**
   - The verse outlines a threefold door to hell (*trividham narakasyaedam dvāram nāśanam ātmanah*) which signifies the destruction of the soul (*ātmanah*). These doors are driven by three negative qualities: desire (*kāmaḥ*), anger (*krodhaḥ*), and greed (*lobhaḥ*). Therefore, one should abandon (*tyajet*) these three (*tasmādetattrayaṃ tyajet*).

2. **Movement Two**: **Śaṅkara’s Detailed Explanation and Interpretation**
   - Śaṅkara’s Bhāṣya elaborates that individuals who are freed from these three doors (*etaiḥ vimuktaḥ*) yet continue to act without steadfastness (*ācarati anutiṣṭhati*) are acting solely for the benefit of the self (*ātmanah śreyasaḥ*). Those who did not act previously (*pūrvaṁ na ācachāra*) begin to act out of that absence of action (*tadapagamāt ācachati*). Consequently, from their actions (*tadācaraṇāt*), they attain the supreme path (*parāṁ gatim*) and even moksha (*mokṣamapi*).

3. **Synthesis/Resolution**: **Integration into a Comprehensive Ethical Framework**
   - The synthesis integrates these demoniac traits into a broader ethical framework, illustrating how abandoning desire, anger, and greed leads to the preservation and enhancement of the self. Śaṅkara emphasizes the importance of renouncing these negative qualities to attain the supreme path, thereby achieving spiritual well-being and liberation.

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of distinguishing between divine and demoniac qualities on an individual's behavior and spiritual progress. For example, individuals who abandon desire (*kāmaḥ*), anger (*krodhaḥ*), and greed (*lobhaḥ*) engage in ethical actions that promote personal and societal well-being, facilitating their attainment of the supreme path (*parāṁ gatim*).
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between renouncing negative qualities and achieving spiritual advancement. Understanding how abandoning desire, anger, and greed leads to the purification of the self can rationalize the importance of ethical conduct and self-discipline for spiritual liberation.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing negative traits (desire, anger, greed) to understanding their consequences (destruction of the soul) and the necessity of renunciation.
  - Investigate how the abandonment of these traits leads to ethical living and the attainment of the supreme path, reinforcing the importance of self-purification in spiritual progress.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Desire (*kāmaḥ*)**: Compare with Buddhist *taṇhā* (craving) and Yogic *kāma* (desire), seen as binding forces that lead to suffering and spiritual entanglement.
  - **Anger (*krodhaḥ*)**: Relate to Buddhist teachings on anger as a defilement that obstructs ethical conduct and Yogic concepts of *krodha* (anger) hindering mental clarity.
  - **Greed (*lobhaḥ*)**: Align with Buddhist *lobha* (greed), a primary cause of suffering, and Yogic *lobha* as excessive desire for material possessions.
  - **Renunciation (*tyajet*)**: Connect with Buddhist *nekkhamma* (renunciation) and Yogic *vairagya* (detachment), emphasizing the importance of letting go of attachments for spiritual progress.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic nature where renouncing negative qualities aligns the individual with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
  - Highlight how overcoming these traits purifies the mind, facilitating the realization of non-duality and spiritual liberation, consistent with Advaita Vedanta's philosophy.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *kāmaḥ*, *krodhaḥ*, *lobhaḥ*, *tyajet*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Desire (*kāmaḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *taṇhā* (craving), a fundamental cause of suffering that binds individuals to the cycle of samsara.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *kāma* (desire), which distracts from spiritual pursuits and binds individuals to material existence.
  - **Anger (*krodhaḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects anger as a defilement that obstructs ethical conduct and spiritual progress.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with *krodha* (anger), which hinders mental clarity and spiritual advancement.
  - **Greed (*lobhaḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Aligns with *lobha* (greed), a primary cause of suffering and unethical behavior.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *lobha* (greed), emphasizing the need to overcome excessive desire for material possessions.
  - **Renunciation (*tyajet*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects *nekkhamma* (renunciation), promoting the abandonment of attachments to achieve liberation.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Resonates with *vairagya* (detachment), advocating for the release of attachments to attain spiritual purity.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the elimination of negative traits like desire, anger, and greed as essential for achieving ethical purity and spiritual liberation.
  - The reduction of these negative traits aligns with paths advocating for selflessness, humility, and the acquisition of true knowledge, similar to Advaita Vedanta’s emphasis on overcoming demoniac qualities.

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *kāmaḥ* (desire) with Buddhist *taṇhā* and Yogic *kāma*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where negative qualities like desire (*kāmaḥ*), anger (*krodhaḥ*), and greed (*lobhaḥ*) are seen as obstacles to realizing the oneness of the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
  - Overcoming these negative qualities purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles, thereby facilitating the realization of non-duality.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how negative qualities obstruct spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how disciplined action and inner purification are essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Actions performed without desire, anger, and greed transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of overcoming these negative qualities exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**:
  - Integrate insights from the Bhagavad Gītā, Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya, and Buddhist-Abhidharma perspectives to present a comprehensive view of how renunciation and praise facilitate liberation.
  - Highlight the interconnectedness of ethical virtues (*daivī sampad*) and the elimination of negative traits (*āsurī sampad*) in achieving self-realization and harmony with the universe.

- **Systematic Development**:
  - Progress from the enumeration of negative qualities to their philosophical implications, demonstrating how each quality contributes to spiritual and moral degradation.
  - Show the transition from recognizing negative traits to understanding their impact on one's spiritual journey and the necessity of overcoming them through renunciation and praise.

- **Meaningful Synthesis**:
  - Highlight the convergence of Hindu and Buddhist philosophies in promoting the elimination of negative traits such as desire, anger, and greed.
  - Emphasize how integrated practices from both traditions foster ethical conduct, mental purification, and selfless action, leading to a non-dual understanding of existence and ultimate liberation.
  - Illustrate the practical application of overcoming these negative qualities in daily life, contributing to personal growth and societal well-being.
