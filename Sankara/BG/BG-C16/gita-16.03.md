### Translation
Tejas — energy or vigor, which refers to proactive strength and illumination. It is not dull or lacking in brightness.
Kṣamā — forgiveness, which involves the suppression of anger arising from being provoked or hurt. Śaṅkara explains that forgiveness specifically mitigates anger.
Dhṛti — fortitude, the special function of the inner self in restraining bodily and sensory impulses, preventing disturbances and maintaining composure.
Śauca — purity, which has two aspects: external cleanliness such as washing and maintaining bodily hygiene, and internal purity characterized by mental clarity free from impurities like attachment, lust, and greed.
Adroha — absence of pride, which means not being arrogant or haughty, a form of non-violence.
Nātimānitā — lack of excessive ego, meaning one does not possess excessive pride. It implies humility and the absence of an exaggerated sense of self-importance.
Thus, these are the attributes (sampada) of the noble (abhijāta). What is the specific meaning of sampada? Śaṅkara explains that sampada refers to the divine qualities of the gods, which are aimed at the well-being and spiritual upliftment of the born beings. O Bharata, these are the divine attributes.

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical effects of cultivating these divine qualities on an individual's behavior and societal interactions. For example, practicing *kṣamā* (forgiveness) can lead to reduced interpersonal conflicts and enhanced social harmony.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between these virtues and their role in achieving personal and spiritual goals. Understanding how *tejaḥ* (energy) sustains ethical actions can rationalize its importance in maintaining consistent spiritual practices.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from basic ethical principles (e.g., *kṣamā*, *śauca*) to more complex spiritual practices (e.g., *jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ*, *dhṛtiḥ*).
  - Investigate how virtues like *tyāgaḥ* (renunciation) evolve from initial acts of charity (*dānam*) to deeper spiritual detachment.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Forgiveness (Kṣamā)**: Compare with the Buddhist practice of *kṣama* (forgiveness) and Yogic *kṣamā* (patience and forgiveness).
  - **Fortitude (Dhṛtiḥ)**: Relate to Buddhist *viriya* (energy) and Yogic *virya* (vigor).
  - **Purity (Śauca)**: Align with Buddhist *śīla* (ethical conduct) and Yogic *śauca* (purity) practices.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic approach where ethical virtues are cultivated selflessly, aligning with Advaita Vedanta's principle of oneness with the ultimate reality (Brahman).
  - Highlight how these virtues transcend dualistic notions of self and other, promoting universal harmony and interconnectedness.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *tejaḥ*, *kṣamā*, *dhṛtiḥ*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Energy (Tejaḥ)**: Aligns with Buddhist *viriya* (energy) and Yogic *virya* (vigor), emphasizing sustained effort in spiritual practices.
  - **Forgiveness (Kṣamā)**: Mirrors Buddhist *kṣama* (forgiveness) and Yogic *kṣamā* (patience and forgiveness), promoting emotional resilience and harmonious relationships.
  - **Fortitude (Dhṛtiḥ)**: Corresponds to Buddhist *viriya* (energy) and Yogic *virya* (vigor), essential for persevering in spiritual endeavors.
  - **Purity (Śauca)**: Reflects Buddhist *śīla* (ethical conduct) and Yogic *śauca* (purity), fostering both physical cleanliness and mental clarity.
  - **Absence of Pride (Adrohaḥ)**: Comparable to Buddhist *anattā* (non-self) and Yogic *anattā* (non-ego), discouraging ego-driven behavior.
  - **Lack of Excessive Ego (Nātimānitā)**: Aligns with Buddhist teachings on *anatta* (non-self) and Yogic *anattā* (ego dissolution), promoting humility and selflessness.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both traditions advocate for a disciplined life centered around ethical behavior, mental purification, and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge.
  - Emphasize selfless action (*nishkama karma*) and the reduction of ego as pathways to liberation (*moksha* in Hinduism and *nirvāṇa* in Buddhism).

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *kṣamā* (forgiveness) with Buddhist *kṣama* and Yogic *kṣamā*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where the individual self (*Atman*) is identical to the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
  - The cultivation of divine qualities purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles and facilitating the realization of non-duality.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of ethical and spiritual practices.
  - Demonstrates how disciplined action and inner purification contribute to the non-dual realization of self and cosmos.
