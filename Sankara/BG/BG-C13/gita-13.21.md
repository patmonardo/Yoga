```

2. Transliteration:
```
satyām api avidyāyāṃ sukhaduḥkhamoheṣu guṇeṣu bhujyamāneṣu yaḥ saṅgaḥ ātmabhāvaḥ saṃsārasya saḥ pradhānaṃ kāraṇaṃ janmanaḥ, 'saḥ yathākāmo bhavati tatkratur bhavati' (bṛ. u. 4.4.5) ityādiśruteḥ | tadetat āha — kāraṇaṃ hetuḥ guṇasaṅgaḥ guṇeṣu saṅgaḥ asya puruṣasya bhoktuḥ sadasadyonijanmasu, satyaśca asatyaśca yonayaḥ sadasadyonayaḥ tāsu sadasadyoniṣu janmāni sadasadyonijanmāni, teṣu sadasadyonijanmasu viṣayabhūteṣu kāraṇaṃ guṇasaṅgaḥ |
```

3. Translation:
"Even when avidyā is present and the guṇas of pleasure, pain and delusion are being experienced, it is attachment, the self-identification, that is the primary cause of saṃsāra and birth, as stated in śruti: 'As one's desire is, so is one's resolve.' This is what is being said - attachment to guṇas, the clinging to guṇas, is the cause, the reason for this experiencer puruṣa's births in higher and lower wombs - these being births in wombs both real and unreal, in these births in higher and lower wombs which are the objects [of experience], attachment to guṇas is the cause."

```

3. Translation:
"This is what has been stated: avidyā, characterized as being established in prakṛti, and attachment to guṇas, which is desire, are the cause of saṃsāra. And this is stated for the purpose of abandonment. The cause of cessation from this is well-known in the Gītā śāstra as knowledge and dispassion along with renunciation. And that knowledge concerning kṣetra and kṣetrajña was presented earlier, [about which it was said] 'knowing which one attains immortality.' And it has been explained through negation of the other and non-attribution of its properties."
