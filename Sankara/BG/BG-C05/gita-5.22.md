## III. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

### Sanskrit
ये हि यस्मात् संस्पर्शजाः विषयेन्द्रियसंस्पर्शेभ्यो जाताः भोगा भुक्तयः दुःखयोनय एव ते, अविद्याकृतत्वात् । दृश्यन्ते हि आध्यात्मिकादीनि दुःखानि तन्निमित्तान्येव । यथा इहलोके तथा परलोकेऽपि इति गम्यते एवशब्दात् । न संसारे सुखस्य गन्धमात्रमपि अस्ति इति बुद्ध्वा विषयमृगतृष्णिकाया इन्द्रियाणि निवर्तयेत् । न केवलं दुःखयोनय एव, आद्यन्तवन्तश्च, आदिः विषयेन्द्रियसंयोगो भोगानाम् अन्तश्च तद्वियोग एव ; अतः आद्यन्तवन्तः अनित्याः, मध्यक्षणभावित्वात् इत्यर्थः । कौन्तेय, न तेषु भोगेषु रमते बुधः विवेकी अवगतपरमार्थतत्त्वः ; अत्यन्तमूढानामेव हि विषयेषु रतिः दृश्यते, यथा पशुप्रभृतीनाम् ॥

### Transliteration
ye hi yasmāt saṃsparśajāḥ viṣayendriyasaṃsparśebhyo jātāḥ bhogā bhuktayaḥ duḥkhayonaya eva te, avidyākṛtatvāt | dṛśyante hi ādhyātmikādīni duḥkhāni tannimittāny eva | yathā ihaloke tathā paraloke'pi iti gamyate evaśabdāt | na saṃsāre sukhasya gandhamātram api asti iti buddhvā viṣayamṛgatṛṣṇikāyā indriyāṇi nivartayet | na kevalaṃ duḥkhayonaya eva, ādyantavantaś ca, ādiḥ viṣayendriyasaṃyogo bhogānām antaś ca tadviyoga eva; ataḥ ādyantavantaḥ anityāḥ, madhyakṣaṇabhāvitvāt ityarthaḥ | kaunteya, na teṣu bhogeṣu ramate budhaḥ vivekī avagataparamārthatattvaḥ; atyantamūḍhānām eva hi viṣayeṣu ratiḥ dṛśyate, yathā paśuprabhṛtīnām ||

### Translation
Because those pleasures born of contact, arising from the contact between objects and senses, are sources of pain alone, being products of ignorance. For sufferings - personal and others - are seen to have these as their cause alone. As in this world, so in the next too - this is understood from the word 'eva'. Understanding that there is not even a trace of happiness in saṃsāra, one should withdraw the senses from the mirage of sense objects. Not only are they sources of pain, but they have beginning and end - their beginning is the contact of senses with objects and their end is separation from these; hence they have beginning and end, are impermanent, existing only in the middle moment - this is the meaning. O son of Kunti, in these pleasures the wise one, the discriminating one who has understood the ultimate truth, does not delight; for only the completely deluded are seen to have attachment to sense objects, like animals and such.
