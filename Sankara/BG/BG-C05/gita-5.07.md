Unified with yoga means established in yoga; purified self means purified nature; conquered self means conquered body; and conquered senses; whose self has become the Self of all beings means one whose inner consciousness has become the Self of all beings from Brahmā down to a blade of grass - meaning one who sees correctly. Such a one, while thus engaged, even while performing action for the welfare of the world, is not bound - meaning is not bound by actions.
