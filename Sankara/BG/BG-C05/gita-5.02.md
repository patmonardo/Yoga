śrībhagavān uvāca —
saṃnyāsaḥ karmayogaś ca niḥśreyasakarāv ubhau |

### Translation
Speaking His own intention for decisive understanding, the Blessed Lord said:
Both renunciation of actions and the yoga of action lead to the highest good.

## II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

### Sanskrit
संन्यासः कर्मणां परित्यागः कर्मयोगश्च तेषामनुष्ठानं तौ उभौ अपि निःश्रेयसकरौ मोक्षं कुर्वाते ज्ञानोत्पत्तिहेतुत्वेन । उभौ यद्यपि निःश्रेयसकरौ, तथापि तयोस्तु निःश्रेयसहेत्वोः कर्मसंन्यासात् केवलात् कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते इति कर्मयोगं स्तौति ॥

### Translation
Sannyāsa is the renunciation of actions and karma yoga is their performance - both of these lead to the highest good, liberation, through being causes for the arising of knowledge. Although both lead to the highest good, still, between these two causes of the highest good, karma yoga is superior to mere renunciation of action - thus he praises karma yoga.
