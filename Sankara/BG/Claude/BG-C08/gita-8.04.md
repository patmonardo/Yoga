अधियज्ञोऽहमेवात्र देहे देहभृतां वर ॥ ४ ॥

### Transliteration
adhibhūtaṁ kṣaro bhāvaḥ puruṣaścādhidaivatam |
adhiyajño'hamevātra dehe dehabhṛtāṁ vara || 4 ||

### Translation
The perishable being is adhibhūta, and Puruṣa is adhidaivata;
I alone am adhiyajña here in this body, O best of the embodied ones.

## II. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit (Key Sections)
अधिभूतं प्राणिजातम् अधिकृत्य भवतीति । कोऽसौ ? क्षरः क्षरतीति क्षरः विनाशी, भावः यत्किञ्चित् जनिमत् वस्तु इत्यर्थः । पुरुषः पूर्णम् अनेन सर्वमिति, पुरि शयनात् वा, पुरुषः आदित्यान्तर्गतो हिरण्यगर्भः, सर्वप्राणिकरणानाम् अनुग्राहकः, सः अधिदैवतम् । अधियज्ञः सर्वयज्ञाभिमानिनी विष्ण्वाख्या देवता, 'यज्ञो वै विष्णुः' (तै. सं. १ । ७ । ४) इति श्रुतेः । स हि विष्णुः अहमेव ; अत्र अस्मिन् देहे यो यज्ञः तस्य अहम् अधियज्ञः ; यज्ञो हि देहनिर्वर्त्यत्वेन देहसमवायी इति देहाधिकरणो भवति, देहभृतां वर ॥
