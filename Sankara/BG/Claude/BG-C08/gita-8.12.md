# Technical Analysis: The Mechanism of Projection through Gap

## I. Mūla Verse

### Sanskrit
सर्वद्वाराणि संयम्य मनो हृदि निरुध्य च ।
मूर्ध्न्याधायात्मनः प्राणमास्थितो योगधारणाम् ॥ १२ ॥

### Transliteration
sarvadvārāṇi saṁyamya mano hṛdi nirudhya ca |
mūrdhnyādhāyātmanaḥ prāṇamāsthito yogadhāraṇām || 12 ||

### Translation
Having restrained all gates, confined the mind in the heart,
And placed the prāṇa in the head, established in yogadhāraṇā.

## II. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit
सर्वद्वाराणि सर्वाणि च तानि द्वाराणि च सर्वद्वाराणि उपलब्धौ, तानि सर्वाणि संयम्य संयमनं कृत्वा मनः हृदि हृदयपुण्डरीके निरुध्य निरोधं कृत्वा निष्प्रचारमापाद्य, तत्र वशीकृतेन मनसा हृदयात् ऊर्ध्वगामिन्या नाड्या ऊर्ध्वमारुह्य मूर्ध्नि आधाय आत्मनः प्राणम् आस्थितः प्रवृत्तः योगधारणां धारयितुम् ॥
