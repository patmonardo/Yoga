### Translation
All actions of the senses means the actions belonging to the senses, and actions of the vital force - the vital force is the internal air, its actions are contraction, expansion etc. - these others offer in the fire of yoga of self-restraint - restraint in the self is self-restraint, that itself is the fire of yoga, in that fire of yoga of self-restraint they offer, cast them, illumined by knowledge - like a lamp by oil, made bright by discriminative understanding, they offer means they dissolve them - this is the meaning.
