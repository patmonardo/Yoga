# Analysis of Bhagavad Gītā 5.4 with Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

## I. Introduction to Verse

### Sanskrit
संन्यासकर्मयोगयोः भिन्नपुरुषानुष्ठेययोः विरुद्धयोः फलेऽपि विरोधो युक्तः, न तु उभयोः निःश्रेयसकरत्वमेव इति प्राप्ते इदम् उच्यते —

### Translation
Given the objection that for sannyāsa and karma yoga, which are to be practiced by different persons and are opposed, their results must also be opposed, and both cannot equally lead to the highest good, this is said:

## II. Mūla Verse

### Sanskrit
साङ्‍ख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः ।
एकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम् ॥ ४ ॥

### Transliteration
sāṅkhyayogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ |
ekam apy āsthitaḥ samyag ubhayor vindate phalam || 4 ||

### Translation
The immature declare Sāṅkhya and Yoga to be different, not the wise.
One who is properly established in even one of them obtains the fruit of both.

## III. Primary Commentary

### Sanskrit
साङ्‍ख्ययोगौ पृथक् विरुद्धभिन्नफलौ बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः । पण्डितास्तु ज्ञानिन एकं फलम् अविरुद्धम् इच्छन्ति । कथम् ? एकमपि साङ्ख्ययोगयोः सम्यक् आस्थितः सम्यगनुष्ठितवान् इत्यर्थः, उभयोः विन्दते फलम् । उभयोः तदेव हि निःश्रेयसं फलम् ; अतः न फले विरोधः अस्ति ॥

### Translation
The immature declare Sāṅkhya and Yoga to be separate with opposed and different results, not the wise. The wise, the knowers, accept one non-contradictory result. How? One who is properly established in even one of Sāṅkhya and Yoga, meaning one who has properly practiced it, obtains the fruit of both. For both have that same highest good as their fruit; therefore there is no contradiction in the result.

## IV. Response to Objection

### Sanskrit
ननु संन्यासकर्मयोगशब्देन प्रस्तुत्य साङ्‍ख्ययोगयोः फलैकत्वं कथम् इह अप्रकृतं ब्रवीति ? नैष दोषः — यद्यपि अर्जुनेन संन्यासं कर्मयोगं च केवलम् अभिप्रेत्य प्रश्नः कृतः, भगवांस्तु तदपरित्यागेनैव स्वाभिप्रेतं च विशेषं संयोज्य शब्दान्तरवाच्यतया प्रतिवचनं ददौ 'साङ्‍ख्ययोगौ' इति । तौ एव संन्यासकर्मयोगौ ज्ञानतदुपायसमबुद्धित्वादिसंयुक्तौ साङ्‍ख्ययोगशब्दवाच्यौ इति भगवतो मतम् । अतः न अप्रकृतप्रक्रियेति ॥

### Translation
Objection: Having begun with the terms sannyāsa and karma yoga, how does he here speak of the unity of the fruits of Sāṅkhya and Yoga, which is not the topic? This is not a fault - although Arjuna's question was made with reference only to sannyāsa and karma yoga, the Lord, without abandoning these, but joining them with his intended distinction, gave his answer using different terms as 'Sāṅkhya and Yoga.' The Lord's view is that these very sannyāsa and karma yoga, when joined with knowledge and the equal understanding of its means, etc., are what is meant by the terms Sāṅkhya and Yoga. Therefore this is not an irrelevant discussion.
