One who performs all actions offering them to Brahman, to the Lord, dedicating them, thinking "I perform action for His sake" like a servant for the master's sake, abandoning attachment even to liberation as a result, performs all actions - he is not tainted by evil, is not bound, like a lotus leaf by water.
