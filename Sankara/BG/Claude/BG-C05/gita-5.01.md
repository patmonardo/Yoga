# Analysis of Bhagavad Gītā 5.1 with Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

## I. Mūla Verse

### Sanskrit
अर्जुन उवाच —
संन्यासं कर्मणां कृष्ण पुनर्योगं च शंससि ।
यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् ॥ १ ॥

### Transliteration
arjuna uvāca —
saṃnyāsaṃ karmaṇāṃ kṛṣṇa punar yogaṃ ca śaṃsasi |
yac chreya etayor ekaṃ tan me brūhi suniścitam || 1 ||

### Translation
Arjuna said:
O Krishna, you praise both renunciation of actions and yoga.
Tell me decisively which one of these two is better.

## II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

### Sanskrit
संन्यासं परित्यागं कर्मणां शास्त्रीयाणाम् अनुष्ठेयविशेषाणां शंससि प्रशंससि कथयसि इत्येतत् । पुनः योगं च तेषामेव अनुष्ठानम् अवश्यकर्तव्यं शंससि । अतः मे कतरत् श्रेयः इति संशयः — किं कर्मानुष्ठानं श्रेयः, किं वा तद्धानम् इति । प्रशस्यतरं च अनुष्ठेयम् । अतश्च यत् श्रेयः प्रशस्यतरम् एतयोः कर्मसंन्यासकर्मयोगयोः यदनुष्ठानात् श्रेयोवाप्तिः मम स्यादिति मन्यसे, तत् एकम् अन्यतरम् सह एकपुरुषानुष्ठेयत्वासम्भवात् मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् अभिप्रेतं तवेति ॥

### Translation
You praise sannyāsa, the renunciation of actions prescribed by scripture and to be specially performed, this is what you say. And again you praise yoga, the necessary performance of those very same actions. Hence my doubt - which is better: the performance of actions or their abandonment? And what is more praiseworthy should be performed. Therefore, whichever of these two - renunciation of action or yoga of action - you consider to be better and more praiseworthy, by whose performance I would attain the highest good, tell me that one decisively, since it is impossible for one person to perform both simultaneously, tell me what you truly intend.

## III. Technical Analysis

### A. Key Terms Analysis

1. From Mūla Verse:
- saṃnyāsa (संन्यास): Complete renunciation
  - Etymology: sam (complete) + ni (down) + √as (to throw)
  - Technical meaning: Total abandonment of prescribed actions

- karman (कर्मन्): Action
  - Root: √kṛ (to do)
  - Context: Prescribed Vedic actions

- yoga (योग): Disciplined action
  - Root: √yuj (to join)
  - Contextual meaning: Performance of action with proper understanding

2. From Bhāṣya:
- śāstrīya (शास्त्रीय): Scriptural
  - Specifically refers to Vedic injunctions
  - Distinguishes from ordinary actions

- anuṣṭheya (अनुष्ठेय): To be performed
  - Technical term for prescribed duties
  - Implies obligatory nature

### B. Structural Analysis

1. Dialectical Structure:
- Thesis: Renunciation (saṃnyāsa)
- Antithesis: Performance (yoga)
- Tension: Apparent contradiction between praise of both

2. Nature of the Question:
- Practical: Which to perform
- Philosophical: Understanding the relationship
- Existential: Personal path determination

## IV. Philosophical Integration

### A. Kantian Framework

1. Transcendental Structure:
- Question concerns conditions of possibility
- Seeks universal principle
- Addresses practical reason

2. Critical Method:
- Examines apparent contradiction
- Seeks systematic resolution
- Questions grounds of both positions

### B. Fichtean Development

1. Self-Positing Analysis:
- Both paths relate to self-determination
- Question of authentic action
- Unity of theory and practice

2. Dialectical Movement:
- From opposition to synthesis
- Through practical necessity
- Toward systematic unity

### C. Hegelian Integration

1. Concrete Universal:
- Beyond abstract opposition
- Toward concrete unity
- Through systematic development

2. Methodological Progression:

## V. Systematic Integration

### A. Technical-Philosophical Unity

1. Term Network:
- saṃnyāsa as transcendental negation
- yoga as practical synthesis
- karma as concrete particular

2. Structural Correspondence:
- Technical terms align with philosophical framework
- Sanskrit analysis supports systematic development
- Commentary guides integration

### B. Developmental Trajectory

1. Current Position:
- Initial opposition stated
- Question properly formulated
- Ground for resolution prepared

2. Progressive Implications:
- Points toward synthetic resolution
- Suggests systematic development
- Prepares for complete integration

## VI. Key Insights

1. The question is properly philosophical:
- Not merely practical choice
- Concerns systematic understanding
- Requires complete resolution

2. Commentary reveals deeper structure:
- Beyond surface opposition
- Toward systematic unity
- Through proper understanding

3. Integration achieved through:
