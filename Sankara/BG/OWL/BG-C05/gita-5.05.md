### Translation
The state called liberation that is attained by the Sāṅkhyas, those established in knowledge, the renunciants - that same state is also reached by the Yogins who, as a means to attaining knowledge, offer their actions to the Lord without attachment to personal results - this is the meaning. Therefore, one who sees Sāṅkhya and Yoga as one due to the unity of their fruit, that person truly sees, sees correctly - this is the meaning.
