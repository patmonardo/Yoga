अज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानं तेन मुह्यन्ति जन्तवः ॥ १५ ॥

### Transliteration
nādatte kasyacit pāpaṃ na caiva sukṛtaṃ vibhuḥ |
ajñānenāvṛtaṃ jñānaṃ tena muhyanti jantavaḥ || 15 ||

### Translation
The all-pervading One takes neither the sin nor indeed the merit of anyone.
Knowledge is covered by ignorance; by that beings are deluded.

## III. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

### Sanskrit
न आदत्ते न च गृह्णाति भक्तस्यापि कस्यचित् पापम् । न चैव आदत्ते सुकृतं भक्तैः प्रयुक्तं विभुः । किमर्थं तर्हि भक्तैः पूजादिलक्षणं यागदानहोमादिकं च सुकृतं प्रयुज्यते इत्याह — अज्ञानेन आवृतं ज्ञानं विवेकविज्ञानम् , तेन मुह्यन्ति 'करोमि कारयामि भोक्ष्ये भोजयामि' इत्येवं मोहं गच्छन्ति अविवेकिनः संसारिणो जन्तवः ॥

### Translation
The all-pervading One neither takes nor accepts the sin of anyone, even a devotee. Nor indeed does it accept merit performed by devotees. Then why do devotees perform meritorious acts characterized by worship, sacrifice, charity, oblations, etc.? This is explained - knowledge, discriminative understanding, is covered by ignorance; by that beings are deluded - worldly beings lacking discrimination fall into delusion thinking "I do, I cause to do, I will enjoy, I will cause to enjoy."
