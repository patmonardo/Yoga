### Sanskrit
तस्मिन् ब्रह्मणि गता बुद्धिः येषां ते तद्बुद्धयः, तदात्मानः तदेव परं ब्रह्म आत्मा येषां ते तदात्मानः, तन्निष्ठाः निष्ठा अभिनिवेशः तात्पर्यं सर्वाणि कर्माणि संन्यस्य तस्मिन् ब्रह्मण्येव अवस्थानं येषां ते तन्निष्ठाः, तत्परायणाश्च तदेव परम् अयनं परा गतिः येषां भवति ते तत्परायणाः केवलात्मरतय इत्यर्थः । येषां ज्ञानेन नाशितम् आत्मनः अज्ञानं ते गच्छन्ति एवंविधाः अपुनरावृत्तिम् अपुनर्देहसम्बन्धं ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः यथोक्तेन ज्ञानेन निर्धूतः नाशितः कल्मषः पापादिसंसारकारणदोषः येषां ते ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः यतयः इत्यर्थः ॥

### Translation
Those whose intellect has gone to that Brahman are tadbuddhayas; tadātmānas means those whose self is that supreme Brahman; tanniṣṭhās - niṣṭhā means absorption, complete dedication - those who, renouncing all actions, remain established in that Brahman alone; and tatparāyaṇās means those whose supreme goal, highest destiny is that - meaning those devoted solely to the Self. Those whose ignorance of the Self has been destroyed by knowledge, being thus qualified, go to non-return - no further connection with a body - jñānanirdhūtakalmaṣās means those whose impurity, the defect which is the cause of saṃsāra like sin etc., has been destroyed, removed by the knowledge described - meaning the striving ones.
