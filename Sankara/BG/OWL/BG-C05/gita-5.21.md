### Sanskrit
बाह्यस्पर्शेषु बाह्याश्च ते स्पर्शाश्च बाह्यस्पर्शाः स्पृश्यन्ते इति स्पर्शाः शब्दादयो विषयाः तेषु बाह्यस्पर्शेषु, असक्तः आत्मा अन्तःकरणं यस्य सः अयम् असक्तात्मा विषयेषु प्रीतिवर्जितः सन् विन्दति लभते आत्मनि यत् सुखं तत् विन्दति इत्येतत् । स ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा ब्रह्मणि योगः समाधिः ब्रह्मयोगः तेन ब्रह्मयोगेन युक्तः समाहितः तस्मिन् व्यापृतः आत्मा अन्तःकरणं यस्य सः ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा, सुखम् अक्षयम् अश्नुते व्याप्नोति । तस्मात् बाह्यविषयप्रीतेः क्षणिकायाः इन्द्रियाणि निवर्तयेत् आत्मनि अक्षयसुखार्थी इत्यर्थः ॥

### Translation
In external contacts - external and contacts are external contacts, being contacted they are contacts, meaning sense objects like sound etc. - in these external contacts, one whose self, inner instrument, is unattached, this one being free from attachment to objects, finds, obtains in the Self whatever happiness there is, that he finds. Such a one whose self is united in Brahman-yoga - yoga in Brahman is samādhi, Brahman-yoga - united with that Brahman-yoga, concentrated, engaged in that, whose self, inner instrument, is such - he attains, pervades imperishable happiness. Therefore, one desiring imperishable happiness in the Self should withdraw the senses from attachment to external objects which is momentary - this is the meaning.
