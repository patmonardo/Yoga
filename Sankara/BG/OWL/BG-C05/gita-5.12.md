## III. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

### Sanskrit
युक्तः 'ईश्वराय कर्माणि करोमि न मम फलाय' इत्येवं समाहितः सन् कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा परित्यज्य शान्तिं मोक्षाख्याम् आप्नोति नैष्ठिकीं निष्ठायां भवां सत्त्वशुद्धिज्ञानप्राप्तिसर्वकर्मसंन्यासज्ञाननिष्ठाक्रमेणेति वाक्यशेषः । यस्तु पुनः अयुक्तः असमाहितः कामकारेण करणं कारः कामस्य कारः कामकारः तेन कामकारेण, कामप्रेरिततयेत्यर्थः, 'मम फलाय इदं करोमि कर्म' इत्येवं फले सक्तः निबध्यते । अतः त्वं युक्तो भव इत्यर्थः ॥

### Translation
The harmonized one, thinking "I perform actions for the Lord, not for my result," being thus concentrated, abandoning, giving up the fruit of action, attains peace called liberation, which is final - being in the final state through the progression of purity of nature, attainment of knowledge, renunciation of all actions, and establishment in knowledge - this completes the sentence. But one who is unharmonized, unconcentrated, through desire-impulsion - impulsion is action, desire's action is desire-impulsion, by that desire-impulsion, meaning being impelled by desire - thinking "I do this action for my result," thus attached to the fruit, is bound. Therefore, you should become harmonized - this is the meaning.
