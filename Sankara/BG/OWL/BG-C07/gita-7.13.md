# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 13

### Introduction

In this verse, the Lord expresses compassion for the beings who, despite His true nature as the eternal, pure, enlightened, and liberated Supreme Self of all beings, remain unaware of Him. He explains the reason for this ignorance, highlighting how the deluding qualities (gunas) of material nature cause beings to misunderstand His transcendental position. This sets the stage for understanding the nature of Maya (illusion) and the challenges faced by beings in realizing the Supreme Truth.

### Sanskrit

एवंभूतमपि परमेश्वरं नित्यशुद्धबुद्धमुक्तस्वभावं सर्वभूतात्मानं निर्गुणं संसारदोषबीजप्रदाहकारणं मां नाभिजानाति जगदिति अनुक्रोशं दर्शयति भगवान्। तच्च किं निमित्तं जगतः अज्ञानमित्युच्यते—

त्रिभिर्गुणमयैर्भावैरेभिः सर्वमिदं जगत्।
मोहितं नाभिजानाति मामेभ्यः परमव्ययम् ॥ १३ ॥

### Transliteration

**Evaṁbhūtam api parameśvaraṁ nitya-śuddha-buddha-mukta-svabhāvaṁ sarva-bhūtātmānaṁ nirguṇaṁ saṁsāra-doṣa-bīja-pradāha-kāraṇaṁ māṁ nābhijānāti jagad iti anukrośaṁ darśayati Bhagavān. Tac ca kiṁ nimittaṁ jagataḥ ajñānam ity ucyate—**

**Tribhir guṇa-mayair bhāvair ebhiḥ sarvam idaṁ jagat |
Mohitaṁ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam || 13 ||**

### Translation

"Though I am the Supreme Lord of such nature—eternally pure, enlightened, liberated, the Self of all beings, beyond qualities, the cause of burning away the seeds of the defects of worldly existence—the world does not know Me. The Lord shows compassion for this. He explains the reason for the world's ignorance:

**Deluded by these threefold states composed of the gunas (qualities), all this world does not recognize Me, who am beyond them and imperishable.**"

## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

त्रिभिः गुणमयैः गुणविकारैः रागद्वेषमोहादि-प्रकारैः भावैः पदार्थैः एभिः यथोक्तैः सर्वम् इदं प्राणि-जातं जगत् मोहितम् अविवेकिताम् आपादितं सत् न अभिजानाति माम्, एभ्यः यथोक्तेभ्यः गुणेभ्यः परं व्यतिरिक्तं विलक्षणं च अव्ययम्—व्ययरहितं जन्मादि-सर्वभावविकारवर्जितम् इत्यर्थः ॥ १३ ॥

### Transliteration

*Tribhiḥ guṇa-mayaiḥ guṇa-vikāraiḥ rāga-dveṣa-mohādi-prakāraiḥ bhāvaiḥ padārthaiḥ ebhiḥ yathoktaiḥ sarvam idaṁ prāṇi-jātaṁ jagat mohitam avivekitām āpāditaṁ sat na abhijānāti mām, ebhyaḥ yathoktebhyaḥ guṇebhyaḥ paraṁ vyatiriktaṁ vilakṣaṇaṁ ca avyayam—vyaya-rahitaṁ janma-ādi-sarva-bhāva-vikāra-varjitam ity arthaḥ || 13 ||

### Translation

"By these threefold states composed of the gunas—modifications of the qualities manifesting as forms like attachment, aversion, and delusion—by these various objects as previously described, this entire world of living beings, being deluded and rendered devoid of discrimination, does not know Me. [They do not know Me] who am beyond these gunas as previously described, distinct, and imperishable—that is, free from decay, devoid of all modifications like birth and other states."

## Technical Analysis

### Key Terms Analysis

1. **त्रिभिः गुणमयैः (tribhiḥ guṇa-mayaiḥ)**

   - **Compound Analysis**: *Tribhiḥ* (threefold) + *guṇa-mayaiḥ* (consisting of qualities).
   - **Contextual Significance**: Refers to the three gunas—sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance)—which constitute material nature and influence the minds and actions of beings.

2. **भावैः (bhāvaiḥ)**

   - **Meaning**: States, conditions, or dispositions.
   - **Context**: The various emotional and mental states arising from the gunas, such as attachment, aversion, and delusion.

3. **एभिः सर्वमिदं जगत् मोहितम् (ebhiḥ sarvam idaṁ jagat mohitam)**

   - **Meaning**: By these, all this world is deluded.
   - **Context**: The influence of the gunas causes the entire world to fall into delusion, preventing beings from perceiving the true nature of the Supreme.

4. **न अभिजानाति माम् (na abhijānāti mām)**

   - **Meaning**: Does not know Me.
   - **Context**: Despite the Lord's true nature, beings fail to recognize Him due to the delusion caused by the gunas.

5. **एभ्यः परम् अव्ययम् (ebhyaḥ param avyayam)**

   - **Meaning**: Beyond these [gunas], imperishable.
   - **Context**: The Lord is transcendent to the gunas and is unaffected by their qualities; He is eternal and unchanging.

6. **राग-द्वेष-मोहादि-प्रकारैः (rāga-dveṣa-mohādi-prakāraiḥ)**

   - **Meaning**: Forms like attachment, aversion, and delusion.
   - **Context**: Specific manifestations of the gunas that lead to delusion.

7. **अव्ययम् (avyayam)**

   - **Meaning**: Imperishable, undecaying.
   - **Context**: The Lord is free from all modifications and changes associated with material existence.

### Structural Elements

- **Cause of Ignorance**: The verse identifies the three gunas and their manifestations as the cause of delusion in beings, leading to ignorance of the Supreme.

- **Nature of Delusion**: Delusion arises from attachment, aversion, and ignorance, which are products of the gunas influencing the mind.

- **Transcendence of the Lord**: Despite being the source of the gunas, the Lord remains beyond them, imperishable and unaffected by their influence.

- **Compassion of the Lord**: The Lord expresses compassion for beings who, deluded by the gunas, fail to recognize His true nature.

### Textual Integration

- **Connection to Previous Verses**: This verse builds upon the earlier explanation that all qualities arise from the Lord, but He remains unattached. Here, the focus is on how beings are deluded by these qualities.

- **Philosophical Implications**:

  - **Maya (Illusion)**: The gunas represent the illusory energy (Maya) that obscures the true nature of the Divine.

  - **Need for Discrimination**: Recognizing the influence of the gunas is essential for overcoming delusion and realizing the Supreme.

- **Upanishadic Correlation**:

  - The concept of beings being deluded by Maya and failing to perceive Brahman is a common theme in Upanishadic teachings.

- **Term Networks**:

  - **Gunas (Qualities)** ↔ **Delusion (Moha)**

  - **Ignorance (Avidya)** ↔ **Lack of Discrimination (Aviveka)**

  - **Transcendence (Para)** ↔ **Imperishable (Avyaya)**

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Phenomena and Noumena**:

   - **Phenomena**: The world as experienced through the senses, influenced by the gunas, leading to delusion.

   - **Noumenon**: The Lord as the thing-in-itself (noumenal reality), beyond sensory perception and unaffected by the qualities.

2. **Limits of Human Understanding**:

   - Beings are limited by the categories of understanding (gunas), which shape their perception and prevent them from knowing the noumenal reality.

3. **Transcendental Illusion**:

   - The delusion caused by the gunas parallels Kant's concept of transcendental illusion, where the mind's inherent structures lead to misunderstandings about the nature of reality.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Self and Not-Self**:

   - The Absolute Ego (the Lord) posits the non-self (world influenced by gunas). Beings identify with the non-self, leading to delusion.

2. **Ignorance and Knowledge**:

   - Delusion arises when the self fails to recognize its true nature as part of the Absolute Ego, being misled by the qualities (gunas).

3. **Moral Imperative**:

   - Overcoming delusion requires an ethical effort to align the individual self with the Absolute, transcending the influences of the gunas.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The Absolute (Lord) as pure being.

   - **Antithesis**: The world deluded by the gunas, failing to recognize the Absolute.

   - **Synthesis**: The realization of the Absolute by overcoming delusion, integrating knowledge of the self and the Lord.

2. **Alienation and Reconciliation**:

   - Beings are alienated from the Lord due to delusion. Through self-awareness and overcoming the gunas, they reconcile with the Absolute.

3. **Absolute Spirit**:

   - The process of the Spirit realizing itself involves transcending the limitations imposed by the gunas and recognizing its true, imperishable nature.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord highlights the profound impact of the three gunas on the consciousness of beings. The gunas, manifesting as various mental and emotional states like attachment, aversion, and delusion, obscure the true nature of the Divine. As a result, beings fail to recognize the Lord, who is beyond these qualities and imperishable.

The technical analysis delves into the key terms and structural elements, elucidating how the gunas contribute to ignorance and delusion. The German Idealist perspectives offer philosophical insights that parallel these concepts, exploring the limitations of human understanding and the path to transcendence.

Understanding this verse encourages individuals to develop discrimination (viveka) and seek knowledge that transcends the influence of the gunas. By doing so, one can overcome delusion, recognize the true nature of the self and the Lord, and move towards liberation.
