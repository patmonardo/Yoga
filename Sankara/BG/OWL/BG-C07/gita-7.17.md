# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 17

### Introduction

Continuing from the previous verse where the Lord described four types of virtuous people who worship Him—the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise—He now highlights the unique position of the wise devotee. In this verse, the Lord explains why the wise (jñānī) is especially dear to Him and how their relationship differs from that of other devotees.

### Sanskrit

**तेषां ज्ञानी नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते ।
प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रियः ॥ १७ ॥**

**Commentary:**

*तेषां चतुर्णां मध्ये ज्ञानी तत्त्ववित् तत्ववित्त्वात् नित्ययुक्तः भवति एकभक्तिश्च, अन्यस्य भजनीयस्य अदर्शनात्; अतः स एकभक्तिः विशिष्यते विशेषम् आधिक्यम् आपद्यते, अतिरिच्यते इत्यर्थः। प्रियो हि यस्मात् अहम् आत्मा ज्ञानिनः, अतः तस्य अहम् अत्यर्थं प्रियः; प्रसिद्धं हि लोके ‘आत्मा प्रियो भवति’ इति। तस्मात् ज्ञानिनः आत्मत्वात् वासुदेवः प्रियो भवतीत्यर्थः। स च ज्ञानी मम वासुदेवस्य आत्मैव इति मम अत्यर्थं प्रियः ॥ १७ ॥*

**Teṣāṁ jñānī nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir viśiṣyate |
Priyo hi jñānino 'tyartham ahaṁ sa ca mama priyaḥ || 17 ||**

**Commentary:**

*Teṣāṁ caturṇāṁ madhye jñānī tattvavit tattvavittvāt nitya-yuktaḥ bhavati eka-bhaktiś ca, anyasya bhajanīyasya adarśanāt; ataḥ sa eka-bhaktiḥ viśiṣyate viśeṣam ādhikyam āpadyate, atiricyate ity arthaḥ. Priyo hi yasmāt aham ātmā jñāninaḥ, ataḥ tasya aham atyarthaṁ priyaḥ; prasiddhaṁ hi loke 'ātmā priyo bhavati' iti. Tasmāt jñāninaḥ ātmatvāt vāsudevaḥ priyo bhavatīty arthaḥ. Sa ca jñānī mama vāsudevasya ātmā eva iti mama atyarthaṁ priyaḥ. || 17 ||*

### Translation

**"Of these, the wise one, who is ever steadfast and devoted exclusively to Me, is the best. For I am exceedingly dear to the wise, and he is dear to Me."**

**Commentary:**

"Among these four types, the wise one (jñānī), who knows the Truth, is ever steadfast (nitya-yuktaḥ) due to his knowledge of the Reality and is exclusively devoted (eka-bhaktiḥ), for there is none else worthy of devotion for him. Therefore, he—the one with exclusive devotion—is distinguished (viśiṣyate), meaning he attains a special excellence; he surpasses the others.

For, because I am the very Self (ātmā) of the wise one, I am exceedingly dear to him; it is well known in the world that 'the Self is dear.' Therefore, because Vāsudeva is the very Self of the wise one, Vāsudeva becomes dear to the wise one. And that wise one is indeed My own Self, says Vāsudeva; therefore, he is exceedingly dear to Me."

"Among these four types, the wise one (jñānī), the knower of the Truth, because of his knowledge of Reality, is ever steadfast (nitya-yuktaḥ) and has exclusive devotion (eka-bhaktiḥ), as there is no other object of worship for him. Therefore, he—the one with exclusive devotion—is distinguished (viśiṣyate), meaning he attains special excellence; he surpasses others—that is the meaning.
