# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 18

### Introduction

In the previous verses, the Lord described four types of virtuous devotees who turn to Him—the distressed, the seeker of wealth, the seeker of knowledge, and the wise. He highlighted the special status of the wise devotee who is ever steadfast and exclusively devoted to Him. Anticipating a question about the other devotees' status, the Lord addresses whether they are also dear to Him and clarifies the unique relationship He shares with the wise.

### Sanskrit

**न तर्हि आर्तादयः त्रयः वासुदेवस्य प्रियाः? न; किं तर्हि?**

**उदाराः सर्व एवैते
ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम् ।
आस्थितः स हि युक्तात्मा
मामेवानुत्तमां गतिम् ॥ १८ ॥**

### Transliteration

**Na tarhi ārtādayaḥ trayaḥ Vāsudevasya priyāḥ? Na; kiṁ tarhi?**

*Udārāḥ sarva evaite
Jñānī tv ātmāiva me matam |
Āsthitaḥ sa hi yuktātmā
Mām evānuttamāṁ gatim || 18 ||*

### Translation

"Then, are not the other three—those who are distressed, etc.—dear to Vāsudeva? No; then what?

**All these are indeed noble, but the wise one is considered as My very Self. For, being steadfast in mind, he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.**"

## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

**उदाराः उत्कृष्टाः सर्व एव एते, त्रयोऽपि मम प्रिया एव इत्यर्थः । न हि कश्चित् मद्भक्तः मम वासुदेवस्य अप्रियः भवति । ज्ञानी तु अत्यर्थं प्रियो भवतीति विशेषः । तत् कस्मात् इत्यत आह—ज्ञानी तु आत्मैव न अन्यो मत्तः इति मे मम मतं निश्चयः । आस्थितः आरोढुं प्रवृत्तः सः ज्ञानी हि यस्मात् 'अहमेव भगवान् वासुदेवः न अन्योऽस्मि' इत्येवं युक्तात्मा समाहितचित्तः सन् मामेव परं ब्रह्म गन्तव्यम् अनुत्तमां गन्तुं प्रवृत्त इत्यर्थः ॥ १८ ॥**

### Transliteration

*Udārāḥ utkṛṣṭāḥ sarva eva ete, trayo 'pi mama priyā eva ity arthaḥ. Na hi kaścit mad-bhaktaḥ mama Vāsudevasya apriyaḥ bhavati. Jñānī tu atyarthaṁ priyo bhavatīti viśeṣaḥ. Tat kasmāt ity ata āha—jñānī tu ātmā eva na anyaḥ mattaḥ iti me mama mataṁ niścayaḥ. Āsthitaḥ āroḍhuṁ pravṛttaḥ saḥ jñānī hi yasmāt 'aham eva Bhagavān Vāsudevaḥ na anyaḥ asmi' iti evaṁ yukta-ātmā samāhita-cittaḥ san mām eva paraṁ brahma gantavyam anuttamāṁ gantuṁ pravṛtta ity arthaḥ. || 18 ||*

### Translation

"All these are indeed noble (udārāḥ), excellent; all of them, even the three, are dear to Me—that is the meaning. For no devotee of Mine, Vāsudeva's, is ever displeasing to Me. But the wise one (jñānī) is exceedingly dear—that is the distinction.

Why is that? He says: The wise one is My very Self; there is none other than Me—that is My firm conviction. Because the wise one, being steadfast in mind (yukta-ātmā), is engaged in ascending—endeavoring to realize—'I am indeed the Lord Vāsudeva; there is none other than Me.' Thus, with concentrated mind, he is engaged in reaching Me alone, the Supreme Brahman, the highest goal—that is the meaning."

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord reassures that all devotees are noble and dear to Him. However, the wise devotee holds a special place because of the profound realization of non-duality—the understanding that there is no distinction between the self and the Divine. This realization leads to exclusive devotion and steadfastness, making the wise one exceedingly dear to the Lord, just as the Lord is exceedingly dear to the wise one.

The commentary and analysis delve into the deep philosophical implications of this relationship, highlighting the integration of knowledge and devotion as the pinnacle of spiritual attainment. The German Idealist perspectives offer parallel insights into self-realization and the unity of consciousness with the Absolute.

This verse encourages seekers to aspire toward the wisdom that leads to the intimate union with the Divine, transcending ordinary devotion and entering into a state of oneness.
