# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 15

### Introduction

After explaining that those who surrender to Him can transcend His divine illusion (Maya), the Lord anticipates a pertinent question: If taking refuge in You enables one to cross over Maya, why do not all people surrender to You? In this verse, He elucidates the reasons why certain individuals do not seek refuge in Him, identifying the characteristics that hinder them from doing so.

### Sanskrit

यदि त्वां प्रपन्नाः मायामेतां तरन्ति, कस्मात् त्वामेव सर्वे न प्रपद्यन्ते इत्युच्यते —

**न मां दुष्कृतिनो मूढाः प्रपद्यन्ते नराधमाः ।
माययापहृतज्ञाना आसुरं भावमाश्रिताः ॥ १५ ॥**

**Commentary:**

न मां परमेश्वरं नारायणं दुष्कृतिनः पापकारिणः मूढाः प्रपद्यन्ते नराधमाः नराणां मध्ये अधमाः निकृष्टाः। ते च मायया अपहृत-ज्ञानाः संमुषित-ज्ञानाः आसुरं भावं हिंसा-अनृत-आदि-लक्षणम् आश्रिताः॥ १५ ॥

### Transliteration

**Yadi tvāṁ prapannāḥ māyām etāṁ taranti, kasmāt tvām eva sarve na prapadyante ity ucyate —**

*Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ |
Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ || 15 ||*

**Commentary:**

*Na māṁ parameśvaraṁ nārāyaṇaṁ duṣkṛtinaḥ pāpa-kāriṇaḥ mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ narāṇāṁ madhye adhamāḥ nikṛṣṭāḥ. Te ca māyayā apahṛta-jñānāḥ saṁmuṣita-jñānāḥ āsuraṁ bhāvam hiṁsā-anṛta-ādi-lakṣaṇam āśritāḥ. || 15 ||*

### Translation

"If those who surrender to You cross over this Maya, why do not all surrender to You? It is said:

**The evildoers, the foolish, the lowest among men, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of a demonic nature—they do not surrender unto Me.**"

**Commentary:**

"Evildoers (duṣkṛtinaḥ), those who engage in sinful actions, and the foolish (mūḍhāḥ) do not surrender to Me, the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa. The lowest among men (narādhamāḥ)—those who are degraded among humans. They, whose knowledge has been stolen away by illusion (Māyā), whose wisdom has been plundered, resort to a demonic nature (āsuraṁ bhāvam), characterized by violence, falsehood, and similar negative qualities."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Moral Law and Duty**:

   - **Evildoers and the Lowest among Men**: Represent those who act against the moral law and fail to fulfill their duty.
   - **Ignorance and Delusion**: The influence of Maya parallels Kant's idea of inclinations that obstruct adherence to the moral law.

2. **Transcendental Illusion**:

   - **Maya**: Functions similarly to Kant's concept of transcendental illusion, where the mind is deceived by appearances and fails to grasp the noumenal reality.

3. **Autonomy and Enlightenment**:

   - **Foolishness (Mūḍhāḥ)**: Lack of enlightenment due to failure to use reason.
   - **Surrender to the Divine**: Aligns with the pursuit of enlightenment through the proper use of reason and moral will.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Ego and the Not-Self**:

   - **Deluded Individuals**: Those who identify with the not-self (material world) rather than recognizing the Absolute Ego (Divine Self).

2. **Moral Action and Self-Realization**:

   - **Embracing Demonic Nature**: Represents the failure to act in accordance with the moral imperative, hindering self-realization.

3. **Overcoming Maya**:

   - **Surrender to the Lord**: Symbolizes the alignment of the individual self with the Absolute, necessary for transcending illusion.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The individual's potential for realizing the Divine.
   - **Antithesis**: The obstruction caused by ignorance and negative qualities.
   - **Synthesis**: Overcoming these through surrender and the development of self-awareness.

2. **Alienation and Reconciliation**:

   - **Delusion**: Leads to alienation from the Absolute Spirit.
   - **Surrender**: Facilitates reconciliation and the return to unity with the Divine.

3. **Ethical Life (Sittlichkeit)**:

   - **Failure to Surrender**: Reflects a breakdown in the ethical life, where individuals act contrary to universal ethical norms.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord explains why certain individuals do not surrender to Him despite the opportunity to transcend Maya through devotion. He identifies four types of people who refrain from seeking refuge:

1. **Evildoers**: Engaged in actions contrary to righteousness.
2. **Foolish**: Lacking spiritual understanding.
3. **Lowest among Men**: Those who have degraded their human potential.
4. **Deluded by Maya**: Whose knowledge is obscured by illusion.

These individuals are characterized by their attachment to negative qualities and their embrace of a nature opposed to the Divine. Their ignorance and delusion prevent them from recognizing the Lord's true nature and hinder their spiritual progress.

The verse serves as a reminder of the obstacles that can impede one's spiritual journey and the importance of cultivating virtues, seeking true knowledge, and avoiding behaviors that lead to degradation. It emphasizes the need for conscious effort to overcome ignorance and align oneself with the path of devotion and righteousness.
