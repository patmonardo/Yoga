# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 7

### Introduction

The Lord continues to emphasize His supreme position as the ultimate cause and sustainer of the universe. In this verse, He declares that nothing is superior to Him and illustrates how all existence is woven into His being, much like pearls strung on a thread.

### Sanskrit

यतः तस्मात् —

मत्तः परतरं नान्यत्किञ्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय ।

मयि सर्वमिदं प्रोतं सूत्रे मणिगणा इव ॥ ७ ॥

### Transliteration

**Yataḥ tasmāt —**

*Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya |

Mayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ sūtre maṇi-gaṇā iva || 7 ||*

### Translation

"Because of this, therefore:

There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Dhanañjaya (Arjuna).

All this is pervaded by Me, as clusters of gems are strung on a thread."

## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

मत्तः परमेश्वरात् परतरम् अन्यत् कारणान्तरं किञ्चित् नास्ति न विद्यते, अहमेव जगत्कारणम् इत्यर्थः, हे धनञ्जय। यस्मादेवम् तस्मात् मयि परमेश्वरे सर्वाणि भूतानि सर्वमिदं जगत् प्रोतं अनुस्यूतम् अनुगतम् अनुविद्धं ग्रथितम् इत्यर्थः, दीर्घतन्तुषु पटवत्, सूत्रे च मणिगणा इव ॥ ७ ॥

### Transliteration

*Mattaḥ parameśvarāt parataraṁ anyat kāraṇāntaraṁ kiñcit nāsti na vidyate, aham eva jagat-kāraṇam ity arthaḥ, he dhanañjaya. Yasmād evam tasmāt mayi parameśvare sarvāṇi bhūtāni sarvam idaṁ jagat protaṁ anusūtam anugatam anuviddhaṁ grathitam ity arthaḥ, dīrgha-tantuṣu paṭa-vat, sūtre ca maṇi-gaṇā iva. || 7 ||

### Translation

"There is nothing higher than Me, the Supreme Lord; no other cause whatsoever exists beyond Me—I alone am the cause of the universe—that is the meaning, O Dhanañjaya. Because this is so, therefore, in Me, the Supreme Lord, all beings, this entire universe is woven, threaded, pervaded, interpenetrated, and connected—that is the meaning; like cloth on extended threads, or like clusters of gems on a thread."

   - **Context**: Another analogy showing how cloth is woven on threads, symbolizing the structure of the universe within the Divine.

### Structural Elements

- **Assertion of Supremacy**: The Lord unequivocally states that nothing is superior to Him, establishing His position as the ultimate reality.

- **Interconnectedness of All Beings**:

  - The universe is depicted as being woven into the Divine, indicating that all existence is fundamentally connected through Him.

- **Analogies Used**:

  - **Gems on a Thread**: Just as gems are strung together by a thread, so are all beings connected by the Divine essence.

  - **Cloth Woven on Threads**: Highlights the foundational role of the threads (the Divine) in forming the fabric (the universe).

### Textual Integration

- **Connection to Previous Verses**:

  - Builds upon Verse 6, where the Lord declares Himself as the origin and dissolution of the universe.

- **Philosophical Consistency**:

  - Reinforces the non-dualistic perspective that the Divine is both the material and efficient cause of all that exists.

- **Upanishadic Correlation**:

  - Echoes statements like "Sarvam khalv idam Brahma" (All this is verily Brahman) from the Chandogya Upanishad, emphasizing the pervasive nature of the Divine.

- **Term Networks**:

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Idealism**:

   - **Phenomena and Noumena**: The universe as phenomena is an expression of the noumenal reality, which is the Divine.

   - **Unity of Apperception**: The assertion that nothing is higher than the Divine aligns with the idea of a fundamental unity underlying all perceptions.

2. **Synthetic Unity of Consciousness**:

   - The interconnectedness of all beings reflects the necessary unity for coherent experience.

3. **Moral Law and the Divine**:

   - Recognizing the Divine as the ultimate reality aligns with Kant's notion of the moral law within, which is universal and absolute.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego**:

   - The Divine represents the absolute 'I' that posits both the self and the not-self, unifying all existence.

2. **Self-Positing and Reflection**:

   - The analogy of gems on a thread symbolizes how individual consciousnesses are reflections of the absolute consciousness.

3. **Dialectical Movement**:

   - **Thesis**: The individual self perceives itself as separate.

   - **Antithesis**: Recognition of the underlying unity with the Divine.

   - **Synthesis**: The self realizes its oneness with the Divine, overcoming the illusion of separateness.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Absolute Spirit**:

   - The universe is the self-expression of the Absolute Spirit, unfolding itself through various forms.

2. **Dialectical Process**:

   - The movement from the particular (individual beings) to the universal (the Divine) reflects the dialectical progression towards self-realization.

3. **Unity of Identity and Difference**:

   - While beings appear distinct (like individual gems), they are fundamentally connected and unified through the Divine (the thread).

4. **Concrete Universality**:

   - The Divine encompasses all particulars, and each particular reflects the whole.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord declares His unparalleled supremacy, stating that nothing exists beyond Him. He uses vivid analogies to illustrate how the entire universe is intrinsically connected to and pervaded by Him. The imagery of gems strung on a thread conveys the idea that while individual beings may appear separate, they are all held together and given existence through the Divine essence.

The technical analysis elucidates key terms and concepts, highlighting the integral relationship between the Divine and the cosmos. The German Idealist perspectives offer philosophical parallels that deepen the understanding of these concepts, exploring themes of unity, consciousness, and the unfolding of the Absolute.

This verse reinforces the non-dualistic vision that the Divine is both immanent and transcendent, the foundation upon which all existence rests, and within which all diversity is unified.
