# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 26

### Introduction

In the preceding verses, Lord Krishna has been elucidating why He remains unmanifest to the deluded and how His divine Yoga-Māyā conceals His true nature from those lacking discernment. He has explained that while He is the Supreme Being, unborn and imperishable, people under the influence of illusion fail to recognize Him. In this verse, He further emphasizes His omniscience and the fact that while He knows all beings—past, present, and future—no one truly knows Him. This highlights the profound depth of His transcendental nature and the rarity of those who genuinely understand Him.

**Commentary:**

"I indeed know all beings that have passed away, the beings existing in the present, O Arjuna, and also those that will come in the future.

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Noumenon and Phenomenon**

   - **Divine Omniscience as Noumenon**: The Lord's complete knowledge represents the noumenal reality, which is beyond human comprehension.

   - **Human Ignorance**: The inability of beings to know the Lord reflects the limitations of human cognition in accessing the noumenal realm.

2. **Limits of Human Reason**

   - **Transcendental Idealism**: Human knowledge is confined to phenomena; the thing-in-itself (the Lord's true nature) remains inaccessible without transcendental insight.

3. **Moral Implications**

   - **Need for Faith**: Since reason alone cannot grasp the Divine, faith becomes necessary to approach the ultimate reality.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego and Individual Ego**

   - **Divine Omniscience**: Represents the Absolute Ego, the ultimate self-consciousness that encompasses all.

   - **Individual Ignorance**: The individual ego lacks awareness of the Absolute Ego due to self-imposed limitations.

2. **Path to Self-Realization**

   - **Exclusive Devotion**: Aligning one's will with the Absolute Ego (through devotion) enables the individual to transcend ignorance.

3. **Moral Striving**

   - **Overcoming Ignorance**: The individual's effort to know the Divine reflects the moral imperative to realize one's true nature.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**

   - **Thesis**: The Lord's omniscience and unknown nature.

   - **Antithesis**: Human ignorance and inability to know the Divine.

   - **Synthesis**: Through devotion and self-consciousness, the individual reconciles with the Absolute Spirit.

2. **Absolute Spirit**

   - **Unfolding of Consciousness**: The progression toward knowing the Divine is part of the Absolute Spirit realizing itself through human consciousness.

3. **Knowledge and Unity**

   - **Unity with the Divine**: True knowledge arises when the individual consciousness unites with the Absolute, overcoming the separation caused by ignorance.

## Conclusion

In Verse 26, Lord Krishna emphasizes His omniscience, declaring that He knows all beings of the past, present, and future. Despite His all-encompassing knowledge, no one truly knows Him, except for those who are exclusively devoted to Him. This underscores the profound depth of the Lord's transcendental nature and the limitations imposed by ignorance and the influence of Māyā.

The technical analysis highlights the key terms and structural elements, revealing the relationship between divine omniscience and human ignorance. The German Idealist perspectives provide philosophical parallels, exploring the limitations of human cognition and the necessity of devotion and faith to approach the ultimate reality.

This verse serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of exclusive devotion and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge to transcend ignorance and begin to comprehend the Supreme Lord's true nature.
