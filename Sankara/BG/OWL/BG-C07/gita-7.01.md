## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

मयि वक्ष्यमाणविशेषणे परमेश्वरे आसक्तं मनः यस्य सः मय्यासक्तमनाः, हे पार्थ! योगं युञ्जन् मनःसमाधानं कुर्वन्, मदाश्रयः अहमेव परमेश्वरः आश्रयः यस्य सः मदाश्रयः। यो हि कश्चित् पुरुषार्थेन केनचित् अर्थी भवति, स तत्साधनं कर्म अग्निहोत्रादि तपः दानं वा किञ्चित् आश्रयं प्रतिपद्यते। अयं तु योगी मामेव आश्रयं प्रतिपद्यते, हित्वा अन्यत् साधनान्तरं मय्येव आसक्तमनाः भवति। यस्त्वं एवंभूतः सन् असंशयं समग्रं समस्तं विभूति-बल-शक्ति-ऐश्वर्यादि-गुण-सम्पन्नं मां यथा, येन प्रकारेण ज्ञास्यसि संशयमन्तरेण ‘एवमेव भगवान्’ इति, तत् शृणु उच्यमानं मया॥

### Transliteration

*Mayi vakṣyamāṇa-viśeṣaṇe parameśvare āsaktaṁ manaḥ yasya saḥ mayy āsakta-manāḥ, he Pārtha! Yogaṁ yuñjan manaḥ-samādhānaṁ kurvan, mad-āśrayaḥ aham eva parameśvaraḥ āśrayaḥ yasya saḥ mad-āśrayaḥ. Yo hi kaścit puruṣārthena kenacit arthī bhavati, sa tat-sādhanaṁ karma agnihotrādi tapaḥ dānaṁ vā kiñcit āśrayaṁ pratipadyate. Ayaṁ tu yogī mām eva āśrayaṁ pratipadyate, hitvā anyat sādhana-antaraṁ mayy eva āsakta-manāḥ bhavati. Yas tvaṁ evaṁbhūtaḥ san asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ samastaṁ vibhūti-bala-śakti-aiśvaryādi-guṇa-sampannaṁ māṁ yathā, yena prakāreṇa jñāsyasi saṁśayam antareṇa ‘evam eva Bhagavān’ iti, tat śṛṇu ucyamānaṁ mayā.||

### Translation

One whose mind is attached to Me—the Supreme Lord characterized by the attributes to be described—is called 'mayy āsakta-manāḥ'. O Pārtha, practicing yoga, concentrating the mind, taking refuge in Me—the Supreme Lord who alone is the refuge. Whoever desires any human goal adopts some means such as rituals like Agnihotra, austerities, charity, or some other refuge. But this yogi takes Me alone as his refuge, abandoning other means, his mind attached solely to Me. Being such, without doubt, you shall know Me, endowed with all attributes like manifestations, strength, power, lordliness, completely and in what manner—by which method—you will know Me without any doubt, thinking 'Indeed, the Lord is like this'; listen to that which I shall declare.

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Structure**:
   - The conditions necessary for the possibility of knowing the Supreme are established.
   - **A priori** faculties: The mind's attachment and the capacity for yoga are prerequisites.

2. **Critical Method**:
   - Examination of the faculties (mind, will) that enable knowledge.
   - Questioning how attachment and practice lead to certain knowledge.

3. **Systematic Unity**:
   - Unification of faculties (sensibility, understanding) through devotion.
   - The mind's focus on the noumenal (Supreme) rather than the phenomenal world.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Self-Positing**:
   - The individual self actively attaches to the Supreme, defining itself in relation to the Absolute.
   - The self's identity is reshaped through devotion and practice.

2. **Dialectical Movement**:
   - **Thesis**: The aspirant's initial state of seeking.
   - **Antithesis**: The challenges and doubts encountered.
   - **Synthesis**: Resolution through taking refuge in the Supreme, leading to knowledge without doubt.

3. **Synthetic Unity**:
   - The merging of individual will with the divine will.
   - The self realizes itself as part of a greater absolute reality.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Systematic Process**:
   - The verse outlines a logical progression akin to the Hegelian dialectic.
   - The movement from subjective attachment to objective knowledge of the Absolute.

2. **Concrete Universality**:
   - The individual's journey reflects universal principles of spiritual evolution.
   - The personal experience embodies the universal process of the Absolute manifesting itself.

3. **Absolute Method**:
   - Knowledge of the Supreme is achieved through the unfolding of Spirit.
   - The self comes to know the Absolute not just intellectually but experientially.

## Conclusion

The first verse of Chapter 7 serves as a gateway to understanding the profound relationship between the individual self and the Supreme. Through a meticulous practice of yoga, unwavering devotion, and taking refuge in the Divine, one is promised complete and doubtless knowledge of the Absolute.

This journey is not merely a personal endeavor but reflects universal philosophical principles explored in both Eastern and Western traditions. The integration of technical analysis with German Idealist thought provides a holistic understanding of the text, highlighting its timeless relevance in the pursuit of ultimate knowledge and realization.
