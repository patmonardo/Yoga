## II. Śaṅkara's Commentary

### Sanskrit
अग्निः कालाभिमानिनी देवता । तथा ज्योतिरपि देवतैव कालाभिमानिनी । अथवा, अग्निज्योतिषी यथाश्रुते एव देवते । भूयसा तु निर्देशो 'यत्र काले' 'तं कालम्' इति आम्रवणवत् । तथा अहः देवता अहरभिमानिनी ; शुक्लः शुक्लपक्षदेवता ; षण्मासा उत्तरायणम् , तत्रापि देवतैव मार्गभूता इति स्थितः अन्यत्र अयं न्यायः । तत्र तस्मिन् मार्गे प्रयाताः मृताः गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो ब्रह्मोपासकाः ब्रह्मोपासनपरा जनाः । 'क्रमेण' इति वाक्यशेषः । न हि सद्योमुक्तिभाजां सम्यग्दर्शननिष्ठानां गतिः आगतिर्वा क्वचित् अस्ति, 'न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति' (बृ. उ. ४ । ४ । ६) इति श्रुतेः । ब्रह्मसंलीनप्राणा एव ते ब्रह्ममया ब्रह्मभूता एव ते ॥
