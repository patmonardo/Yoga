### Sanskrit
ब्रह्म अर्पणं येन करणेन ब्रह्मवित् हविः अग्नौ अर्पयति तत् ब्रह्मैव इति पश्यति, तस्य आत्मव्यतिरेकेण अभावं पश्यति, यथा शुक्तिकायां रजताभावं पश्यति ; तदुच्यते ब्रह्मैव अर्पणमिति, यथा यद्रजतं तत् शुक्तिकैवेति । 'ब्रह्म अर्पणम्' इति असमस्ते पदे । यत् अर्पणबुद्ध्या गृह्यते लोके तत् अस्य ब्रह्मविदः ब्रह्मैव इत्यर्थः ।

### Transliteration
brahma arpaṇaṃ yena karaṇena brahmavit haviḥ agnau arpayati tat brahmaiva iti paśyati, tasya ātmavyatirekeṇa abhāvaṃ paśyati, yathā śuktikāyāṃ rajatābhāvaṃ paśyati; taducyate brahmaiva arpaṇamiti, yathā yadrajataṃ tat śuktikaiveti | 'brahma arpaṇam' iti samaste pade | yat arpaṇabuddhyā gṛhyate loke tat asya brahmavidaḥ brahmaiva ityarthaḥ |

### Translation
The instrument by which the knower of Brahman offers the oblation in the fire, that he sees as Brahman alone, he sees its non-existence apart from the Self, just as one sees the non-existence of silver in the shell; therefore it is said "the offering instrument is Brahman alone," just as "what appears as silver is just the shell."

### Translation
This being so, even for one who has ceased from action, who has renounced all actions, the accomplishment of sacrifice-ness for knowledge serves the purpose of praising right vision; what is well-known as offering etc. in the context of sacrifice (adhiyajña), that for this seer of the highest truth is Brahman itself in the spiritual context (adhyātma).

### Translation
Therefore, for the knower who realizes "all this is indeed Brahman," there is absence of action, due to absence of instrumental cognition. For no sacrificial action is seen without instrumental cognition. All action like the Agnihotra etc. is seen to possess instrumental cognition of specific deities presented by scripture as recipients etc., and to possess ego-sense of agency and intention for results; it is not seen with dissolved cognition of the distinctions of action, instruments and results, or without ego-sense of agency and intention for results. But this action has its cognition of distinctions of instruments like offering etc., action and results dissolved by the understanding of Brahman. Therefore it is indeed non-action.

## I. Text Presentation

### Sanskrit
तथा च दर्शितम् 'कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येत्' (भ. गी. ४ । १८) 'कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः' (भ. गी. ४ । २०) 'गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्ते' (भ. गी. ३ । २८) 'नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित्' (भ. गी. ५ । ८) इत्यादिभिः । तथा च दर्शयन् तत्र तत्र क्रियाकारकफलभेदबुद्ध्युपमर्दं करोति । दृष्टा च काम्याग्निहोत्रादौ कामोपमर्देन काम्याग्निहोत्रादिहानिः । तथा मतिपूर्वकामतिपूर्वकादीनां कर्मणां कार्यविशेषस्य आरम्भकत्वं दृष्टम् । तथा इहापि ब्रह्मबुद्ध्युपमृदितार्पणादिकारकक्रियाफलभेदबुद्धेः बाह्यचेष्टामात्रेण कर्मापि विदुषः अकर्म सम्पद्यते । अतः उक्तम् 'समग्रं प्रविलीयते' (भ. गी. ४ । २०) इति ॥

### Transliteration
tathā ca darśitam 'karmaṇyakarma yaḥ paśyet' (bg. 4.18) 'karmaṇyabhipravṛtto'pi naiva kiñcitkaroti saḥ' (bg. 4.20) 'guṇā guṇeṣu vartante' (bg. 3.28) 'naiva kiñcitkaromīti yukto manyeta tattvavit' (bg. 5.8) ityādibhiḥ | tathā ca darśayan tatra tatra kriyākārakaphalabhedabuddhyuparmaṃ karoti...

### Translation
And thus it has been shown: "Who sees non-action in action" (4.18), "Though engaged in action, he truly does nothing" (4.20), "Guṇas act on guṇas" (3.28), "The knower of truth should think 'I do nothing at all'" (5.8) and so forth. And showing thus, in various places he establishes the dissolution of the cognition of distinctions between action, instruments and results. And it is seen in desired fire-sacrifices etc. that through the dissolution of desire comes the cessation of desired fire-sacrifices etc. Just as intentional and unintentional actions are seen to produce specific effects. Similarly here too, through mere external movement, even the action of the knower whose cognition of distinctions between instruments like offering etc., action and results has been dissolved by the understanding of Brahman becomes non-action. Therefore it is said "completely dissolves" (4.20).

# BG 4.24: Analysis of Alternative View

## I. Text Presentation

### Sanskrit
अत्र केचिदाहुः — यत् ब्रह्म तत् अर्पणादीनि ; ब्रह्मैव किल अर्पणादिना पञ्चविधेन कारकात्मना व्यवस्थितं सत् तदेव कर्म करोति । तत्र न अर्पणादिबुद्धिः निवर्त्यते, किं तु अर्पणादिषु ब्रह्मबुद्धिः आधीयते ; यथा प्रतिमादौ विष्ण्वादिबुद्धिः, यथा वा नामादौ ब्रह्मबुद्धिरिति ॥

### Transliteration
atra kecidāhuḥ — yat brahma tat arpaṇādīni; brahmaiva kila arpaṇādinā pañcavidhena kārakātmanā vyavasthitaṃ sat tadeva karma karoti | tatra na arpaṇādibuddhiḥ nivartyate, kiṃ tu arpaṇādiṣu brahmabuddhiḥ ādhīyate; yathā pratimādau viṣṇvādibuddhiḥ, yathā vā nāmādau brahmabuddhiriti ||

### Translation
Here some say: What is Brahman, that is the offering etc.; Brahman indeed, being established as the five-fold instrumental nature beginning with offering, performs that very action. There the cognition of offering etc. is not removed, but rather the cognition of Brahman is superimposed on the offering etc.; just as the cognition of Viṣṇu etc. on images, or as the cognition of Brahman on names etc.

## II. Technical Analysis

### A. Key Terms

1. Philosophical Terms:
   - brahmabuddhi: cognition of Brahman
   - kārakātman: instrumental nature

# BG 4.24 Final Commentary Section 2: Analysis of Specific Brahman-Identification

## I. Text Presentation

### Sanskrit
अत्र च समर्थमिदं वचनम् 'ब्रह्मार्पणम्' इत्यादि ज्ञानस्य यज्ञत्वसम्पादने ; अन्यथा सर्वस्य ब्रह्मत्वे अर्पणादीनामेव विशेषतो ब्रह्मत्वाभिधानमनर्थकं स्यात् । ये तु अर्पणादिषु प्रतिमायां विष्णुदृष्टिवत् ब्रह्मदृष्टिः क्षिप्यते नामादिष्विव चेति ब्रुवते न तेषां ब्रह्मविद्या उक्ता इह विवक्षिता स्यात् , अर्पणादिविषयत्वात् ज्ञानस्य ।

### Transliteration

### Translation
And here this statement "brahmārpaṇam" etc. is capable of establishing the sacrifice-nature of knowledge; otherwise, if everything were Brahman, the specific designation of offering etc. as Brahman would be meaningless. But those who say that the vision of Brahman is projected onto offering etc. like the vision of Viṣṇu on an image, or like on names etc. - their understanding of Brahman as stated is not what is meant here, because knowledge has offering etc. as its object.

# BG 4.24 Final Commentary Section 3: Arguments from Liberation Purpose

## I. Text Presentation

### Sanskrit
न च दृष्टिसम्पादनज्ञानेन मोक्षफलं प्राप्यते । 'ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यम्' इति चोच्यते । विरुद्धं च सम्यग्दर्शनम् अन्तरेण मोक्षफलं प्राप्यते इति । प्रकृतविरोधश्च ; सम्यग्दर्शनम् च प्रकृतम् 'कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येत्' (भ. गी. ४ । १८) इत्यत्र, अन्ते च सम्यग्दर्शनम् , तस्यैव उपसंहारात् ।

### Transliteration
na ca dṛṣṭisampādanajñānena mokṣaphalaṃ prāpyate | 'brahmaiva tena gantavyam' iti cocyate | viruddhaṃ ca samyagdarśanam antareṇa mokṣaphalaṃ prāpyate iti | prakṛtavirodhaśca; samyagdarśanam ca prakṛtam 'karmaṇyakarma yaḥ paśyet' (bg. 4.18) ityatra, ante ca samyagdarśanam, tasyaiva upasaṃhārāt |

### Translation
And liberation as the result is not obtained through knowledge that merely accomplishes vision. And it is said "Brahman alone is to be reached by him." And it is contradictory that the result of liberation could be obtained without right vision. And it contradicts the context; for right vision is the subject matter in "who sees inaction in action" (4.18), and at the end right vision [is discussed], because that alone is concluded.

### Translation
With statements like "Knowledge-sacrifice is superior to material sacrifice" (4.33), "Having obtained knowledge, supreme peace" (4.39), etc., the chapter concludes while praising right vision alone. There it would be illogical that suddenly, out of context, the vision of Brahman in offering etc. would be spoken of like the vision of Viṣṇu in an image. Therefore this verse has exactly the meaning as explained.
