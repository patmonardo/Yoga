## II. Commentary

### Sanskrit
एवं यथोक्ता बहुविधा बहुप्रकारा यज्ञाः वितताः विस्तीर्णाः ब्रह्मणो वेदस्य मुखे द्वारे वेदद्वारेण अवगम्यमानाः ब्रह्मणो मुखे वितता उच्यन्ते ; तद्यथा 'वाचि हि प्राणं जुहुमः' (ऐ. आ. ३ । २ । ६) इत्यादयः । कर्मजान् कायिकवाचिकमानसकर्मोद्भावान् विद्धि तान् सर्वान् अनात्मजान् , निर्व्यापारो हि आत्मा । अत एवं ज्ञात्वा विमोक्ष्यसे अशुभात् । न मद्व्यापारा इमे, निर्व्यापारोऽहम् उदासीन इत्येवं ज्ञात्वा अस्मात् सम्यग्दर्शनात् मोक्ष्यसे संसारबन्धनात् इत्यर्थः ॥

### Transliteration
evaṃ yathoktā bahuvidhā bahuprakārā yajñāḥ vitatāḥ vistīrṇāḥ brahmaṇo vedasya mukhe dvāre vedadvāreṇa avagamyamānāḥ brahmaṇo mukhe vitatā ucyante; tadyathā 'vāci hi prāṇaṃ juhumaḥ' (ai. ā. 3.2.6) ityādayaḥ | karmajān kāyikavācikamānasakarmodbhavān viddhi tān sarvān anātmajān, nirvyāpāro hi ātmā | ata evaṃ jñātvā vimokṣyase aśubhāt | na madvyāpārā ime, nirvyāpāro'ham udāsīna ityevaṃ jñātvā asmāt samyagdarśanāt mokṣyase saṃsārabandhanāt ityarthaḥ ||

### Translation
Thus the many kinds of sacrifices as described, of many types, are spread out, extended at the mouth, the door of brahman (Veda), known through the door of the Veda, are said to be spread at the mouth of brahman; as in "we offer prāṇa in speech" (Ai. Ā. 3.2.6) etc. Know them all to be born of action - arising from bodily, verbal and mental action, not born of the Self, for the Self is actionless. Therefore knowing thus you shall be liberated from the inauspicious. Knowing thus: "these are not my activities, I am actionless, uninvolved" - from this right vision you shall be liberated from the bondage of worldly existence - this is the meaning.
