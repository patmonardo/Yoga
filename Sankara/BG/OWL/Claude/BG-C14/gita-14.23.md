### Transliteration
udāsīnavat yathā udāsīnaḥ na kasyacit pakṣaṃ bhajate, tathā ayaṃ guṇātītatvopāyamārge'vasthitaḥ āsīnaḥ ātmavit guṇaiḥ yaḥ saṃnyāsī na vicālyate vivekadarśanāvasthātaḥ | tadetat sphuṭīkaroti — guṇāḥ kāryakaraṇaviṣayākārapariṇatāḥ anyo'nyasmin vartante iti yaḥ avatiṣṭhati | chandobhaṅgabhayāt parasmaipada prayogaḥ | yo'nutiṣṭhatīti vā pāṭhāntaram | na iṅgate na calati, svarūpāvastha eva bhavati ityarthaḥ || 23 ||

### Translation
Just as one who is indifferent does not take anyone's side, so this knower of the Self, established in the path of transcending the guṇas, seated, a renunciate who is not moved by the guṇas from the state of discriminative vision. He clarifies this: who remains established in the understanding that the guṇas, transformed into the form of effects, instruments and objects, operate among themselves. The parasmaipada usage is due to fear of breaking the meter. Or there is another reading 'yo'nutiṣṭhati'. Does not waver means does not move, remains established in his own nature - this is the meaning.
