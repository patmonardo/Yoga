### Translation
Due to its purity, like a crystal, sattva is illuminating and harmless, free from affliction. How does it bind? Through attachment to happiness - the superimposition on the Self as subject of happiness which is an object, thinking "I am happy" is a false attachment to happiness. This is avidyā. For the property of an object does not belong to the subject. And desire etc. up to steadiness are properties of the field, the object, as stated by the Blessed Lord. Therefore, through avidyā alone, which is its own property characterized by non-discrimination between object and subject, it causes attachment as it were to happiness which is not the Self, makes the unattached appear attached, makes the unhappy appear happy. Similarly with attachment to knowledge - knowledge, being associated with happiness, is a property of the field, the object, of the inner organ, not of the Self; if it were a property of the Self, attachment and bondage would be impossible. Attachment to knowledge etc. should be understood like attachment to happiness. O sinless one, free from affliction.
