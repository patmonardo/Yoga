It is said to be beyond darkness, untouched by ignorance."

### Translation
"For encouraging one who is depressed thinking knowledge etc. is difficult to attain, he says - knowledge beginning with freedom from pride; the knowable has been spoken of as 'I will declare that which is to be known'; what is to be attained through knowledge means the knowable itself when known becomes the fruit of knowledge; while being known it is the knowable. These three are specially established in the intellect, in the heart of all beings. Indeed, there alone are the three perceived."
