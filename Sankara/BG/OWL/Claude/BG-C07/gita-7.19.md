बहूनां जन्मनां ज्ञानार्थसंस्काराश्रयाणाम् अन्ते समाप्तौ ज्ञानवान् प्राप्तपरिपाकज्ञानः मां वासुदेवं प्रत्यगात्मानं प्रत्यक्षतः प्रपद्यते । कथम्? वासुदेवः सर्वम् इति । यः एवं सर्वात्मानं मां नारायणं प्रतिपद्यते, सः महात्मा; न तत्समः अन्यः अस्ति, अधिको वा । अतः सुदुर्लभः, ‘मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु’ (भ.गी. ७.३) इति हि उक्तम् ॥ १९ ॥

### Transliteration

**Jñānī punar api stūyate —**

*Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate |
Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ || 19 ||

Bahūnāṁ janmanāṁ jñānārtha-saṁskāra-āśrayāṇām ante samāptau jñānavān prāpta-paripāka-jñānaḥ māṁ Vāsudevaṁ pratyag-ātmānaṁ pratyakṣataḥ prapadyate. Katham? Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti. Yaḥ evaṁ sarvātmānaṁ māṁ Nārāyaṇaṁ pratipadyate, saḥ mahātmā; na tat-samaḥ anyaḥ asti, adhiko vā. Ataḥ sudurlabhaḥ, ‘manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu’ (Bh. Gī. 7.3) iti hi uktam. || 19 ||*

### Translation

**"Even the wise is further praised:**

**At the end of many births, the one endowed with knowledge surrenders unto Me, realizing that Vāsudeva is everything. Such a great soul is very rare."**

**Commentary:**

"At the culmination of many births, which serve as the basis for the cultivation of knowledge, the wise one—whose knowledge has matured—directly surrenders unto Me, Vāsudeva, the indwelling Self. How does he surrender? By realizing 'Vāsudeva is everything.' One who thus realizes Me, Nārāyaṇa, as the Self of all, he is indeed a great soul (mahātmā); there is none equal to him, nor superior. Therefore, he is very rare, as it has been said, 'Among thousands of men...' (Bhagavad Gītā 7.3)."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Idealism**: The realization that 'Vāsudeva is everything' parallels Kant's notion of the noumenal reality underlying phenomenal appearances.

2. **Moral Progress Over Lifetimes**: The progression over many births suggests a cumulative moral development, akin to Kant's idea of striving toward the highest good through moral actions.

3. **Rarity of Enlightenment**: The difficulty of achieving true knowledge reflects the limitations of human reason in grasping the noumenal realm.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego and Self-Realization**: Recognizing 'Vāsudeva is everything' mirrors the individual's recognition of the Absolute Ego as the true Self, dissolving the distinction between self and not-self.

2. **Process of Annihilating the Not-Self**: Over many lifetimes, the individual sheds the not-self (material attachments) to realize unity with the Absolute.

3. **Moral Duty and Surrender**: Surrendering to the Divine aligns with fulfilling the moral imperative to align one's will with the Absolute Ego.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: Individual existence characterized by separation from the Divine.
   - **Antithesis**: The quest for knowledge and recognition of the limitations of individuality.
   - **Synthesis**: Realization that 'Vāsudeva is everything,' uniting the individual self with the Absolute Spirit.

2. **Absolute Spirit Realizing Itself**: The individual's journey represents the unfolding of the Absolute Spirit becoming self-aware through human consciousness.

3. **Rarity and Inevitability**: While such realization is rare (sudurlabhaḥ), it is the inevitable culmination of the dialectical process of consciousness seeking unity with the Absolute.
