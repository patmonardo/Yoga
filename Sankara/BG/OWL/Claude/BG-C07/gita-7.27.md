# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 27

### Introduction

In the previous verses, Lord Krishna has been explaining why people, deluded by ignorance and bound by desires, fail to recognize His true, transcendental nature. He has highlighted how beings do not know Him due to the influence of **Māyā** and their own limitations. In this verse, He delves deeper into the root cause of this ignorance, explaining how the delusion arising from the dualities of desire and aversion leads all beings into a state of confusion at birth. This understanding is crucial for spiritual seekers aiming to overcome ignorance and realize the Divine.

### Translation

**"O scion of the Bharata dynasty, O conqueror of foes, all beings fall into complete delusion at birth due to the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion."**

**Commentary:**

"Desire (icchā) and aversion (dveṣa) together are called 'icchā-dveṣau.' That which arises from these two is 'icchā-dveṣa-samutthaḥ.' By that—the delusion born of desire and aversion.

To specify the cause, it is said: 'dvandva-mohena'—the delusion (moha) caused by the pairs of opposites (dvandva). Desire and aversion themselves, like heat and cold, are mutually opposing and relate to pleasure and pain and their causes. At different times, all beings are associated with these pairs, which are denoted by the term 'dvandva' (pairs of opposites).

When and where desire and aversion, manifesting through the attainment of pleasure and pain and their causes, become active, they generate delusion (moha) in all beings. This delusion obstructs the arising of true knowledge concerning the ultimate reality of the Self by preventing the mind from gaining mastery over itself.

Indeed, for one whose mind is overpowered by the defects of desire and aversion, even knowledge of external things as they truly are does not arise. What then can be said about one whose intellect is possessed by these and is utterly deluded regarding the inner Self, where numerous obstacles prevent the rise of knowledge?

Therefore, due to this delusion born of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O descendant of Bharata, all beings are deluded at birth—they enter into a state of complete delusion at the time of their origin, O subduer of enemies. The implication is that all beings are born under the sway of delusion.

Because of this, all beings, their discernment obstructed by the delusion of the pairs of opposites, do not know Me, who am their very Self. Consequently, they do not worship Me in the state of being the Self."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Phenomena and Noumena**:

   - **Phenomena**: The pairs of opposites represent the sensory world of phenomena, which is subject to change and illusion.

   - **Noumena**: The true nature of the Self and the Divine is noumenal, beyond sensory perception.

2. **Desire and Aversion as Affects**:

   - They cloud judgment and prevent the exercise of pure practical reason, leading to moral heteronomy.

3. **Transcendental Idealism**:

   - Recognizing that time, space, and causality are forms of human intuition helps to understand that dualities are constructs of the mind.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Ego and Non-Ego**:

   - Desire and aversion arise when the Ego interacts with the Non-Ego (the external world), leading to a sense of separation.

2. **Moral Striving**:

   - The self must overcome desire and aversion to align with the Absolute Ego, realizing freedom.

3. **Role of Delusion**:

   - Delusion is a necessary stage in self-realization, prompting the individual to strive towards higher knowledge.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The individual's innate purity at birth.

   - **Antithesis**: The delusion caused by desire and aversion.

   - **Synthesis**: Overcoming delusion leads to self-realization and unity with the Absolute Spirit.

2. **Master-Slave Dialectic**:

   - Beings become slaves to their desires and aversions, losing autonomy.

   - Liberation comes through self-consciousness and mastery over the senses.

3. **Progress of Spirit**:

   - The evolution from delusion to enlightenment reflects the unfolding of the Absolute Spirit through human experience.

## Conclusion

In Verse 27, Lord Krishna identifies **desire and aversion** as the fundamental causes of delusion that bind all beings from birth. This delusion, arising from the interaction with the **pairs of opposites** in the material world, obstructs true knowledge and prevents beings from recognizing the Divine as their own Self. As a result, they do not worship the Lord in His true nature.

The verse emphasizes the importance of overcoming desire and aversion to dispel delusion. By gaining mastery over the mind and senses, one can transcend the dualities of the material world, attain true knowledge, and realize the Self's unity with the Divine.

Understanding this concept is crucial for spiritual aspirants seeking liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It highlights the need for self-discipline, discernment, and devotion in the journey toward self-realization.
