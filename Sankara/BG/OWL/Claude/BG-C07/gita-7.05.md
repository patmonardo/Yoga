# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 5

### Introduction

The Lord continues His exposition on the nature of Prakriti (material nature), distinguishing between His lower material energy and a higher spiritual energy that animates and sustains the universe. He reveals that beyond the eightfold material elements lies a superior Prakriti—the living entities—which is integral to the functioning of the cosmos.

### Sanskrit

अपरेयमितस्त्वन्यां प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम् ।

जीवभूतां महाबाहो ययेदं धार्यते जगत् ॥ ५ ॥

अपरा न परा निकृष्टा अशुद्धा अनर्थकरी संसारबन्धनात्मिका इयम् । इतः अस्याः यथोक्तायाः तु अन्यां विशुद्धां प्रकृतिं मम आत्मभूतां विद्धि मे परां प्रकृष्टां जीवभूतां क्षेत्रज्ञलक्षणां प्राणधारणनिमित्तभूतां हे महाबाहो, यया प्रकृत्या इदं धार्यते जगत् अन्तः प्रविष्टया ॥ ५ ॥

### Transliteration

**Apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām |

Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat || 5 ||

Aparā na parā nikṛṣṭā aśuddhā anartha-karī saṁsāra-bandhana-ātmikā iyam. Itaḥ asyāḥ yathoktāyāḥ tu anyāṁ viśuddhāṁ prakṛtiṁ mama ātma-bhūtāṁ viddhi me parāṁ prakṛṣṭāṁ jīva-bhūtāṁ kṣetrajña-lakṣaṇāṁ prāṇa-dhāraṇa-nimitta-bhūtāṁ he mahā-bāho, yayā prakṛtyā idaṁ dhāryate jagat antaḥ praviṣṭayā. || 5 ||**

### Translation

**"This is My lower nature; but beyond it, O mighty-armed one, know that there exists a higher Prakriti of Mine, which is the life-principle (jīva-bhūta) that sustains this universe."**

**Commentary:**

"This lower nature is inferior, impure, causing misfortune, and is the very essence of bondage to the cycle of birth and death. Beyond this, other than this aforementioned nature, know My higher Prakriti, which is pure, of the nature of the Self, superior, the life-principle, characterized as the knower of the field (kṣetrajña), and the cause that sustains life, O mighty-armed one. By this Prakriti, which has entered into the universe, the world is upheld."

## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

अपरा न परा निकृष्टा अशुद्धा अनर्थकरी संसारबन्धनात्मिका इयम्। इतः अस्याः यथोक्तायाः तु अन्यां विशुद्धां प्रकृतिं मम आत्मभूतां विद्धि मे परां प्रकृष्टां जीवभूतां क्षेत्रज्ञलक्षणां प्राणधारणनिमित्तभूतां हे महाबाहो, यया प्रकृत्या इदं धार्यते जगत् अन्तः प्रविष्टया॥ ५ ॥

### Transliteration

*Aparā na parā nikṛṣṭā aśuddhā anartha-karī saṁsāra-bandhana-ātmikā iyam. Itaḥ asyāḥ yathoktāyāḥ tu anyāṁ viśuddhāṁ prakṛtiṁ mama ātma-bhūtāṁ viddhi me parāṁ prakṛṣṭāṁ jīva-bhūtāṁ kṣetrajña-lakṣaṇāṁ prāṇa-dhāraṇa-nimitta-bhūtāṁ he mahā-bāho, yayā prakṛtyā idaṁ dhāryate jagat antaḥ praviṣṭayā. || 5 ||*

### Translation

"This is the lower (not higher) nature—inferior, impure, causing misfortune, and the essence of bondage to the cycle of birth and death. Beyond this, other than this previously described nature, know My higher Prakriti, which is pure, of the nature of the Self, superior, the life-principle (jīva-bhūta), characterized as the knower of the field (kṣetrajña), and the cause of sustaining life, O mighty-armed one. By this Prakriti, which has entered within, this universe is sustained."

The Lord emphasizes that beyond the inert material elements lies a superior conscious principle, the life-force that is integral to all existence.

The technical analysis clarifies the key terms and their implications, highlighting the distinction and relationship between the material and the spiritual. The German Idealist perspectives provide a philosophical framework that parallels these concepts, exploring the roles of consciousness, self, and the Absolute in the unfolding of reality.

By recognizing the higher Prakriti within ourselves and the universe, we move towards a more profound realization of the unity of all existence and our place within it.
