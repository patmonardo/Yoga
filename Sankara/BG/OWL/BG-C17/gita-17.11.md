atha idānīṁ yajñaḥ trividhāḥ ucyate iti trayo guṇānusāraḥ, yajñasya hetuḥ phalalābhaṁ iti। asya yajñasya vidhidiṣṭiḥ śāstrānusāram asti। yat yajñaḥ manasi svīkāryate yat ucitam iti niścitya manaḥ samādhāya saḥ yajñaḥ sāttvikaḥ ucyate। ataḥ phalakāṅkṣhirvidhidiṣṭo yajñaḥ sattvalīṅgaḥ bhavati। ॥11॥
```

#### Translation

```markdown
### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that the sacrifice (*yajña*) is categorized into three types based on three qualities (*trayo guṇānusāraḥ*), where the purpose (*hetuḥ*) of the sacrifice is the desire for fruits (*phalalābhaṁ*). The regulation (*vidhidiṣṭiḥ*) of this sacrifice is in accordance with the scriptures (*śāstrānusāram*).
By establishing that the sacrifice is appropriate (*ucitam*) as accepted by the mind (*manasi svīkāryate*) through contemplation (*manaḥ samādhāya*), such a sacrifice is called Sattvic (*sāttvikaḥ*).
Therefore, sacrifices performed with the desire for fruits and regulated by duty are classified as Sattvic (*sattvalīṅgaḥ bhavati*). ॥11॥

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of performing Sattvic sacrifices—those performed with pure intent and adherence to duty—on an individual's behavior and spiritual progress. Empirical evidence suggests that such practices promote ethical conduct, mental clarity, and spiritual well-being.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between the motivations behind Sattvic sacrifices and their positive outcomes. Understanding how pure intentions and duty-oriented actions lead to spiritual advancement rationalizes the importance of cultivating Sattvic qualities in rituals.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing the threefold categorization of sacrifices to understanding their philosophical and ethical implications.
  - Investigate how performing Sattvic sacrifices fosters ethical living and spiritual growth, while Rajasic and Tamasic sacrifices may lead to attachment and moral challenges.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Sattvic Sacrifices**: Compare with Buddhist *sīla* (ethical conduct) and Yogic *sattva* (purity), emphasizing virtuous and disciplined practices that promote spiritual progress.
  - **Rajasic Sacrifices**: Relate to Buddhist *rāga* (attachment) and Yogic *rajas* (passion), highlighting desires and active engagements that can lead to attachment and suffering.
  - **Tamasic Sacrifices**: Align with Buddhist *moha* (delusion) and Yogic *tamas* (ignorance), focusing on how misguided motivations hinder spiritual clarity and progress.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic approach where Sattvic sacrifices align the individual with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight how overcoming Rajasic and Tamasic motivations purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles, consistent with Advaita Vedanta's non-dual philosophy.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *sāttvikaḥ*, *rājasī*, *tāmasī*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Sattvic Sacrifices (*sāttvikaḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *sīla* (ethical conduct), fostering virtuous and disciplined behavior that leads to spiritual progress.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *sattva* (purity), emphasizing clarity, harmony, and virtuous practices essential for spiritual advancement.

  - **Rajasic Sacrifices (*rājasī*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects *rāga* (attachment), which binds individuals to desires and leads to suffering.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with *rajas* (passion), highlighting active engagement driven by desires and attachment to material pursuits.

  - **Tamasic Sacrifices (*tāmasī*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Aligns with *moha* (delusion), which clouds judgment and impedes spiritual clarity.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *tamas* (ignorance), emphasizing lethargy, delusion, and obstacles to spiritual progress.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the cultivation of ethical conduct and purity (*sīla*, *sattva*) for spiritual advancement.
  - The elimination of attachment (*rāga*, *rajas*) and delusion (*moha*, *tamas*) is essential for achieving spiritual clarity and liberation, aligning with Advaita Vedanta’s emphasis on overcoming negative traits.

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *sāttvikaḥ* with Buddhist *sīla* and Yogic *sattva*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where Sattvic sacrifices align the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation (*moksha*).
  - Rajasic and Tamasic sacrifices are seen as obstacles that create dualistic separations, hindering the realization of oneness with Brahman.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how different forms of sacrifices influence spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how disciplined action and inner purification, guided by Sattvic sacrifices, are essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Sacrificial actions performed in accordance with scriptural guidelines transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of adhering to scriptural instructions exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis
