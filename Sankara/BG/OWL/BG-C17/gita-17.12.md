abhisandhāya tu phalaṁ dambhārthamapi caiva yat iti tatra yajñasya hetuḥ phalaṁ ca dambham asti। yajño’yaṁ rājasam iti cedyat yat ijyate, tadā saḥ rājasasattvānusāraḥ। asya yajñasya kārye dambhaḥ atikaṭuḥ cidraśca yatnāḥ naitikaṁ ca kalyāṇam api na kariṣyanti। ataḥ iyaṁ yajñaḥ rājasattvasya śreyo bhavati। ॥12॥
```

#### Translation

```markdown
### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that performing sacrifices with the desire for fruits (*phalaṁ*) and pride (*dambhārtham*) indicates that the purpose (*hetuḥ*) of the sacrifice is to gain results and satisfy ego. Such a sacrifice, when performed with these intentions, is classified as Rajasic (*rājasam*). The actions driven by pride are excessively harsh (*atikaṭuḥ*), deceitful (*cidraśca*), and neglect ethical well-being (*naitikaṁ ca kalyāṇam*). Therefore, this type of sacrifice is considered Rajasic, aligning with the mode of passion and desire. ॥12॥

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of performing Rajasic sacrifices—those motivated by desire for fruits and pride—on an individual's behavior and spiritual progress. Empirical evidence suggests that such sacrifices can lead to increased ego, attachment to results, and ethical compromises, hindering spiritual development.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between the motivations behind Rajasic sacrifices and their negative outcomes. Understanding how desire and pride undermine the purity and effectiveness of sacrificial practices rationalizes the importance of cultivating Sattvic qualities for genuine spiritual efficacy.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing the motivations behind sacrifices to understanding their philosophical and ethical implications.
  - Investigate how aligning sacrificial practices with Sattvic qualities fosters ethical living and spiritual growth, while Rajasic sacrifices may lead to attachment and moral challenges.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Rajasic Sacrifices**: Compare with Buddhist teachings on *rāga* (attachment) leading to suffering, and Yogic concepts of *rajas* (passion) causing imbalance and distraction from spiritual pursuits.
  - **Emotional Impact**: Relate to how excessive passion and desire in Buddhist and Yogic traditions lead to emotional turmoil and hinder mental clarity.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic approach where sacrificial practices aligned with Sattvic qualities harmonize the individual with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight how overcoming Rajasic motivations purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles, consistent with Advaita Vedanta's non-dual philosophy.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *sāttvikaḥ*, *rājasam*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Rajasic Sacrifices (*rājasam*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *rāga* (attachment), which binds individuals to desires and leads to suffering.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with *rajas* (passion), highlighting active engagement driven by desires and attachment to material pursuits.

  - **Emotional Impact**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Excessive attachment and desire lead to emotional turmoil and hinder spiritual progress.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Passionate desires disrupt mental clarity and balance, obstructing the path to self-realization.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the elimination of attachment (*rāga*, *rajas*) as essential for achieving emotional stability and spiritual liberation.
  - Aligns with Śaṅkara’s Advaita Vedanta, which advocates for overcoming negative traits to realize the oneness of the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *rāga* (Buddhist) and *rajas* (Yogic) with Śaṅkara’s Rajasic qualities.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where Rajasic sacrifices, driven by desire and pride, create dualistic separations and hinder the realization of oneness with Brahman.
  - Such sacrifices lead to moral degradation and spiritual stagnation, obstructing the path to liberation (*moksha*).

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how sacrificial motivations influence spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how overcoming Rajasic motivations through disciplined, Sattvic actions is essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Sacrificial actions performed in accordance with Sattvic qualities transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of adhering to scriptural instructions exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**:
  - Integrate insights from the Bhagavad Gītā, Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya, and Buddhist-Abhidharma perspectives to present a comprehensive view of how Rajasic sacrificial practices influence spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight the interconnectedness of ethical virtues (*daivī sampad*) and the elimination of negative traits (*āsurī sampad*) through cultivating Sattvic sacrifices in achieving self-realization and harmony with the universe.

- **Systematic Development**:
  - Progress from the enumeration of sacrificial motivations to their philosophical and ethical implications, demonstrating how Rajasic sacrifices contribute to spiritual and moral degradation.
  - Show the transition from recognizing the negative impact of Rajasic sacrifices to understanding the necessity of cultivating Sattvic sacrifices for spiritual advancement and liberation.

- **Meaningful Synthesis**:
  - Highlight the convergence of Hindu, Buddhist, and Yogic philosophies in promoting the cultivation of ethical and pure sacrifices while eliminating attachment and delusion.
  - Emphasize how integrated practices from these traditions foster ethical conduct, mental purification, and selfless action, leading to a non-dual understanding of existence and ultimate liberation.
  - Illustrate the practical application of cultivating Sattvic sacrifices in daily life, contributing to personal growth, societal well-being, and spiritual progress.
