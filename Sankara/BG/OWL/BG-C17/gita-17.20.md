## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of performing Sattvic charity—charitable acts performed with sincere intent, at appropriate times and places, and directed towards deserving individuals—on an individual's behavior and societal well-being. Empirical evidence suggests that such practices promote social harmony, reduce suffering, and foster positive relationships.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between the qualities of Sattvic charity and their positive outcomes.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Sattvic Charity (*sāttvikaṁ dānaṁ*)**:
