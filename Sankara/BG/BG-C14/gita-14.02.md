# Śaṅkara Commentary Analysis: BG 14.2

## I. Main Commentary Text

### Sanskrit
इदं ज्ञानं यथोक्तमुपाश्रित्य, ज्ञानसाधनम् अनुष्ठाय इत्येतत् , मम परमेश्वरस्य साधर्म्यं मत्स्वरूपताम् आगताः प्राप्ताः इत्यर्थः । न तु समानधर्मता साधर्म्यम् , क्षेत्रज्ञेश्वरयोः भेदानभ्युपगमात् गीताशास्त्रे । फलवादश्च अयं स्तुत्यर्थम् उच्यते । सर्गेऽपि सृष्टिकालेऽपि न उपजायन्ते । न उत्पद्यन्ते । प्रलये ब्रह्मणोऽपि विनाशकाले न व्यथन्ति च व्यथां न आपद्यन्ते, न च्यवन्ति इत्यर्थः ॥ २ ॥

### Transliteration
idaṃ jñānaṃ yathoktam upāśritya, jñānasādhanam anuṣṭhāya ityetat, mama parameśvarasya sādharmyaṃ matsvarūpatām āgatāḥ prāptāḥ ityarthaḥ | na tu samānadharmatā sādharmyam, kṣetrajñeśvarayoḥ bhedānabhyupagamāt gītāśāstre | phalavādaśca ayaṃ stutyartham ucyate | sarge'pi sṛṣṭikāle'pi na upajāyante | na utpadyante | pralaye brahmaṇo'pi vināśakāle na vyathanti ca vyathāṃ na āpadyante, na cyavanti ityarthaḥ || 2 ||

### Translation
Having taken refuge in this knowledge as stated, meaning having practiced the means to knowledge, they have attained My nature, the nature of the Supreme Lord - this is the meaning. Sādharmya does not mean similarity of attributes, since the Gītā scripture does not accept difference between kṣetrajña and Īśvara. And this statement of result is spoken for the purpose of praise. Even at creation, at the time of manifestation, they are not born, they do not come into being. And at dissolution, even at the time of destruction of Brahmā, they are not disturbed, meaning they do not undergo disturbance, they do not fall - this is the meaning.
