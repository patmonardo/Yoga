### Translation
Know rajas to be of the nature of passion, from coloring (rañjana), having passion as its nature like red ochre etc. Arising from craving and attachment - craving is desire for the unattained, attachment is the mind's clinging characterized by pleasure in what is attained; arising from craving and attachment means having craving and attachment as its source.
