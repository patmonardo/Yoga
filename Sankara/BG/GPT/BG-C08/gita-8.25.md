**Verse 25 (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 8)**

**Sanskrit Text:**

धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् ।
तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥ २५ ॥

**Transliteration:**

**Dhūmo rātris tathā kṛṣṇaḥ ṣaṇ-māsā dakṣiṇāyanam |
Tatra cāndrama-saṁ jyotir yogī prāpya nivartate || 25 ||**

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**

- **Dhūmaḥ (धूमः):** Smoke; representing a deity or principle associated with the "smoky" or "obscure" path.
- **Rātriḥ (रात्रिः):** Night; again symbolizing a presiding deity/time-factor linked to darkness.
- **Tathā (तथा):** Similarly; also.
- **Kṛṣṇaḥ (कृष्णः):** The dark half of the month (Kṛṣṇa-pakṣa), or the deity/time associated with the darker lunar fortnight.
- **Ṣaṇ-māsā dakṣiṇāyanam (षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम्):** The six months of the southern solstice; again represented by a set of deities/time principles.
- **Tatra (तत्र):** There; in that path.
- **Cāndrama-saṁ jyotiḥ (चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिः):** The lunar light; referring to a fruit/realm associated with the moon, often interpreted as the lunar heaven (Pitṛ-loka) where pious souls enjoy their karmic results.
- **Yogī (योगी):** Here includes those who have engaged in karma and upāsanā but not attained full Brahman-knowledge. Śaṅkara suggests "yogī" here includes "karmī" (ritualists/doers of good deeds) due to their inclusion under the umbrella of spiritual practitioners.
- **Prāpya (प्राप्य):** Having attained; reached.
- **Nivartate (निवर्तते):** Returns; comes back.

**Translation:**

"Smoke, night, the dark half of the lunar month, and the six months of the southern solstice—under these conditions, the yogi, attaining the lunar realm (cāndrama-saṁ jyotiḥ), subsequently returns (to this world)."

**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Dhūmo rātriḥ… etc."**: Just as in the previous verse (8.24) where bright, luminous conditions (agni, jyoti, etc.) represented the devatās and time factors guiding the soul to a path of no return, here the conditions are reversed: smoke (dhūma), night (rātri), the dark half of the month (kṛṣṇa-pakṣa), and the six months of Dakṣiṇāyana. These factors are also presided over by respective deities and constitute an alternate path.

- **"Tatra cāndrama-saṁ jyotiḥ"**: On this path, the departing soul (the practitioner, who might be a ritualist performing Vedic rites and seeking heavenly enjoyments) attains the lunar world, i.e. the Chandraloka or Pitṛ-loka. This "moon-lit realm" is a fruit of meritorious deeds but not the ultimate liberation.

- **"Yogī karmī prāpya… nivartate"**: While called "yogī," Śaṅkara clarifies this includes karmīs who perform righteous deeds and rituals. They enjoy their fruits in this lunar heaven (Candramasa-loka), but once their accumulated merit (puṇya) depletes, they return to earthly existence. This is the path leading back to samsāra. It's a route of “return,” unlike the bright path leading to non-return.

- **Contrasted with the Bright Path**: Verse 24 described a "bright path" that leads to no return. Verse 25 describes the alternate "dark path" leading to the lunar world and thus eventually back to samsāra. This distinction mirrors what the Upanishads say about the Devayāna (path of gods, leading to final liberation) and the Pitṛyāna (path of ancestors, leading back to rebirth).

**Key Points from Commentary:**

1. **The Two Paths**:
   - Bright path (described in Verse 24): Fire, light, day, bright half of month, six months of Uttarāyaṇa → leads to non-return (liberation or gradual liberation).
   - Dark path (described here in Verse 25): Smoke, night, dark half of month, six months of Dakṣiṇāyana → leads to the lunar world and eventual return to samsāra.

2. **Nature of the Dark Path**:
   The dark path is associated with enjoyment of karmic fruits but not liberation. After enjoyment in the lunar heaven (Candramasa-loka), the soul must descend again to earthly existence, continuing the cycle of birth and death.

---

**Philosophical and Spiritual Implications:**

- **Impermanence of Heavenly Enjoyments**: This verse emphasizes that heaven (like the lunar realm) is not the ultimate liberation. It is a temporary reward station. After the soul’s accumulated merit is exhausted, it returns to human (or other) birth.

- **Discouraging Sole Reliance on Ritual and Merit**: Merely performing good deeds and seeking heavenly pleasures is not enough for final emancipation. The Gita encourages understanding the eternal nature of Brahman and cultivating devotion and knowledge leading to non-returning paths.

- **Alignment with Upanishadic Teachings**: The Kaṭha and Chāndogya Upanishads also describe these two paths: the bright path of the gods and the dark path of the ancestors. The Gita integrates these concepts, guiding the seeker to aim beyond heavenly enjoyments to final liberation.

---

**Practical Relevance:**

For a spiritual aspirant, this verse clarifies that simply accumulating pious deeds for heavenly pleasures is ultimately unsatisfactory. One must strive for the path that leads to no return (attaining Brahman, abiding in the Supreme Lord) rather than settle for temporary heavenly abodes.

---

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

We have the cosmic picture now:

- Verse 24: Bright path leads to non-return, culminating in Brahman-realization.
- Verse 25: Dark path leads to return, no final liberation, just recycling through samsāra.

This dichotomy encourages earnest seekers to move beyond ritualistic rewards, fostering exclusive devotion and knowledge to secure liberation, the true "Path to the Supreme."

---

**Conclusion:**

Verse 25 identifies the alternative path characterized by smoke, night, the dark fortnight, and the southern solstice—conditions symbolic of a return-route. Souls traveling this path, though they might enjoy a heavenly sojourn in the lunar realm, inevitably return to samsāra. This stands in contrast to the bright path. The Gita thus teaches that only the path associated with Brahman-knowledge and devotion leads beyond all return, while lesser spiritual accomplishments yield only temporary relief from the cycle of rebirth.
