**Verse 19 (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 8)**

**Sanskrit Text:**

भूतग्रामः स एवायं भूत्वा भूत्वा प्रलीयते ।
रात्र्यागमेऽवशः पार्थ प्रभवत्यहरागमे ॥ १९ ॥

**Transliteration:**

**Bhūta-grāmaḥ sa evāyaṁ bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate |
Rātry-āgame ’vaśaḥ pārtha prabhavaty ahar-āgame || 19 ||**

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**

- **Bhūta-grāmaḥ (भूतग्रामः):** The multitude (or totality) of beings; referring to all living entities, both stationary (sthāvara) and moving (jaṅgama).
- **Sa eva (स एव):** That very same.
- **Ayaṁ (अयम्):** This (set of beings).
- **Bhūtvā bhūtvā (भूत्वा भूत्वा):** After repeatedly coming into existence; again and again taking birth.
- **Pralīyate (प्रलीयते):** It dissolves, merges back, ceases to be manifest.
- **Rātri-āgame (रात्र्यागमे):** At the arrival of night (Brahmā’s cosmic night).
- **Avaśaḥ (अवशः):** Helpless, without independence or free will.
- **Pārtha (पार्थ):** O son of Pṛthā (Arjuna).

- **Ahar-āgame (अहरागमे):** At the arrival of day (Brahmā’s cosmic day).

**Translation:**

"That same multitude of beings, repeatedly taking birth, merges back (into the unmanifest) at the coming of night. Helplessly, O Pārtha, it again comes forth at the arrival of day."

**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary and Context:**

The snippet before the verse indicates some reasons for the Gita’s exposition:

- **"अकृताभ्यागमकृतविप्रणाशदोषपरिहारार्थम्":** To remove doubts about whether unperformed duties or undone things cause impediments, and to show that knowledge leads to freedom from certain defects.

- **"बन्धमोक्षशास्त्रप्रवृत्तिसाफल्यप्रदर्शनार्थम्":** To demonstrate the purpose of scriptures discussing bondage and liberation, thus showing the fruitfulness of spiritual inquiry.

- **"अविद्यादिक्लेशमूलकर्माशयवशाच्च अवशः भूतग्रामः भूत्वा भूत्वा प्रलीयते… संसारे वैराग्यप्रदर्शनार्थं च":** The cluster of beings (bhūta-grāma), due to karmic impressions rooted in ignorance and afflictions (avidyā, kleśas), is compelled (avaśaḥ) to appear and disappear repeatedly. By highlighting this cyclical helplessness, the Gita intends to inspire dispassion (vairāgya) toward samsāra.

**Explanation of the Verse:**

- **“Bhūta-grāmaḥ sa eva ayaṁ”**: The same aggregate of beings that existed in the previous cosmic cycle reappears in the next. There’s no entirely new set of beings—it's the very same jīva-s returning again and again.

- **"Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate"**: At the start of Brahmā’s day, these beings are manifested from the unmanifest state. Repeatedly, at the day’s end (Brahmā’s night), they dissolve back into the unmanifest seed condition. This infinite recurrence emphasizes that existence in samsāra is cyclical and not leading to any final rest or stability.

- **"Rātry-āgame ’vaśaḥ"**: They dissolve at night, and "prabhavaty ahar-āgame" arise again at daybreak—both times without any freedom or autonomy. 'Avaśaḥ' underscores their powerlessness, bound by karmic tendencies. They must return to manifested existence and then again dissolve, over and over.

**Śaṅkara’s Key Point:**
This verse aims to show the futility of worldly existence. Beings trapped in samsāra follow this cosmic rhythm: appearing and disappearing with cosmic days and nights. Their helpless, repetitive cycle stems from ignorance and karmic conditioning. Understanding this encourages the practitioner to develop dispassion (vairāgya) towards samsāra and to seek permanent liberation (mokṣa) through the knowledge and devotion described in the Gita.

---

**Philosophical Context:**

This verse continues the theme: no matter how grand the scale (Brahmā’s day and night), samsāra remains repetitive and controlled by past impressions and ignorance. This cosmic-level repetition mirrors the individual’s personal cycle of births and deaths. Recognizing that even the totality of beings is caught in this cycle emphasizes that liberation must come from transcending this cosmic routine, not from within it.

---

**Practical Implications:**

For a spiritual aspirant:

- Understanding the repetitive and helpless nature of samsāra at a cosmic scale deepens dispassion for worldly existence and heavenly enjoyments.
- This encourages focus on the Supreme Reality and the means to final liberation where no forced return exists.
- By cultivating knowledge (jñāna), devotion (bhakti), and disciplined practice (yoga), one escapes the cycle of repetitive manifestation and dissolution.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

This verse is yet another nudge toward transcending impermanence. After learning about cosmic timescales, unmanifest and manifest states, and the two eternal paths (no-return and return), the Gita here shows that the entire cosmic host of beings is powerless. Only by understanding this and aspiring for the supreme goal—attaining Brahman, as previously indicated—does one break free from cyclical patterns. Thus, the verse reinforces the importance of seeking the Supreme instead of remaining tangled in cycles of becoming and unbecoming.

---

**Conclusion:**

Verse 19 (re-explained) reveals that all beings repeatedly arise and vanish with cosmic day and night, entirely without freedom. This cyclical and helpless nature of samsāra fosters dispassion and propels the seeker to strive for liberation. Understanding this further cements the quest for the Supreme Lord and Brahman-realization as the only meaningful end to one’s spiritual journey.
