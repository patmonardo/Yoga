**Commentary:**

"At the time of departure (death), with a mind that is unmoving and free from distraction ('manasā achalena'), being united with devotion ('bhaktyā yuktaḥ')—devotion being the act of worship—and also endowed with the strength of yoga ('yoga-balena chaiva'), which refers to the steadiness of mind characterized by mental firmness arising from a collection of impressions born of meditative absorption (samādhi)—thus equipped, controlling the mind in the lotus of the heart, then, through the upward-moving channel (suṣumṇā), by the conquest of the elements (bhūmi-jaya-krameṇa), placing the prāṇa between the eyebrows ('bhruvoḥ madhye prāṇam āveśya'), remaining fully alert ('samyak apramattaḥ san')—such a yogi, knowing thus, attains that Supreme, Transcendental Person, who is characterized as 'the Seer, the Ancient' (as described in Verse 9), who is luminous ('divyam'), possessing the nature of light."
