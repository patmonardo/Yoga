# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 13

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been guiding Arjuna on how to attain the Supreme Brahman at the time of death. He has emphasized the importance of unwavering devotion, disciplined practice, control of the senses, and meditation on the Supreme Being. In Verse 12, He detailed the yogic techniques for restraining the senses, focusing the mind, and controlling the life force (prāṇa) to prepare for meditation.

Now, in Verse 13, Lord Krishna introduces the sacred syllable **Om** (Omkāra) as a crucial means for realizing the Supreme Brahman. He explains how uttering this single-syllabled Brahman while remembering the Divine leads to the highest spiritual attainment. This verse underscores the profound significance of **Om** in spiritual practice and its efficacy in leading the practitioner to liberation.
