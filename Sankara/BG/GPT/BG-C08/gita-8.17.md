# Chapter 8: The Path to the Supreme

## Verse 17

### Introduction

In the previous verses of Chapter 8, Lord Krishna has been explaining the impermanence of all worlds within the material realm, including the highest abode of Brahmā (Brahmaloka). He emphasized that even those who reach these exalted realms are subject to the cycle of birth and death, and only by attaining Him can one escape this cycle. In Verse 16, He stated that those who reach Him do not undergo rebirth.

Now, in Verse 17, Lord Krishna elaborates on why even Brahmaloka and other higher realms are impermanent. He introduces the concept of cosmic time, explaining the immense durations of Brahmā's day and night, and how the cycle of creation and dissolution operates within these vast time frames. This verse underscores the temporal nature of all material existence, reinforcing the need to seek the eternal Supreme.

### Translation

**"Those who know the duration of Brahmā's day, which extends to a thousand yugas (ages), and the night which also ends after a thousand yugas—they understand day and night. Because even Brahmaloka is limited by time, all the worlds are subject to return, O Arjuna."**

## Detailed Commentary

### Understanding the Verse

1. **Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ**

   - **Sahasra-yuga-paryantam (सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तम्):** Extending to a thousand yugas (ages); comprising a duration of one thousand yugas.
   - **Ahar (अहः):** Day.
   - **Yat (यत्):** Which.
   - **Brahmaṇaḥ (ब्रह्मणः):** Of Brahmā, the creator deity.
   - **Viduḥ (विदुः):** Know; understand.

   **Explanation:**

   - Those who understand that the duration of Brahmā's day lasts for one thousand yugas comprehend the immense scale of cosmic time. A 'yuga' refers to a specific age or epoch in Hindu cosmology.

2. **Rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'horātra-vido janāḥ**

   - **Rātrim (रात्रिम्):** Night.
   - **Yuga-sahasrāntām (युगसहस्रान्ताम्):** Ending after a thousand yugas; lasting for a thousand yugas.
   - **Te (ते):** They.
   - **Ahorātra-vidaḥ (अहोरात्रविदः):** Knowers of day and night; those who understand cosmic days and nights.
   - **Janāḥ (जनाः):** People; individuals.

   **Explanation:**

   - Similarly, they know that Brahmā's night also lasts for one thousand yugas. Those who are knowledgeable about these vast durations understand the concept of cosmic day and night.

3. **Contextual Understanding**

   - **Kāla-paricchinnatvāt (कालपरिच्छिन्नत्वात्):** Because of being limited by time.
   - **Punar āvartinaḥ (पुनरावर्तिनः):** Subject to return; revolving in the cycle of birth and death.
   - **Lokāḥ (लोकाः):** Worlds; realms of existence.

   **Explanation:**

   - Even Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā, is bound by time and thus impermanent. Therefore, all worlds, including Brahmaloka, are subject to the cycle of creation and dissolution, making beings who reach there subject to return.

### Śaṅkarācārya's Commentary

- **Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇaḥ viduḥ**

  - The day ('ahar') of Brahmā is said to last for one thousand yugas. 'Paryantam' means ending with or comprising.

- **Rātrim yuga-sahasrāntām**

  - Similarly, Brahmā's night is also of the same duration—one thousand yugas.

- **Te ahorātra-vidaḥ kāla-saṅkhyā-vidaḥ janāḥ**

  - Those who know ('viduḥ') these measurements of time ('kāla-saṅkhyā')—the cosmic day and night—are the ones who understand the vast cycles of creation and dissolution.

- **Conclusion**

  - Because these durations are finite and measured, Brahmaloka and other worlds are bound by time ('kāla-paricchinnatvāt') and thus impermanent. Therefore, beings who reach these worlds are subject to return ('punar āvartinaḥ').
