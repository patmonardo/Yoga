**Context and Background:**

Previously, the Gita described cosmic cycles of manifestation and dissolution (Verses 17-19) and introduced the concept of beings repeatedly emerging from the unmanifest and dissolving back into it during the cosmic day and night of Brahmā. Now Lord Krishna points out that beyond the described "unmanifest" that serves as the seed of cyclical creation, there exists an even higher, different kind of unmanifest Reality—eternal and imperishable. While all beings and worlds eventually get destroyed, this Supreme Reality does not.

This sets the stage for differentiating between two types of "unmanifest":
1. The lower unmanifest (associated with Prakṛti and the cycles of creation/dissolution).
2. The higher unmanifest (the Supreme Brahman), transcending even that primal seed state.

**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Parastasmāt tu…"**: The word *tu* contrasts this higher reality with the previously mentioned unmanifest. The text had discussed an "avyakta" (unmanifest) that serves as the seedbed for cosmic manifestation. Now, Lord Krishna points out that beyond (paraḥ) that previously described unmanifest is another, distinct unmanifest reality.

- **"Bhāvo ’nyo ’vyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ"**:
  - *Bhāvaḥ*: A reality or entity.
  - *Anyaḥ*: Other, meaning it differs from the unmanifest (avyakta) we’ve already heard of.
  - *Avyaktaḥ*: This higher entity is also called unmanifest, but unlike the first unmanifest (which is the seed of material creation), this is of a different order.
  - *Avyaktāt sanātanaḥ*: It is beyond that unmanifest and is eternal (sanātana)—not subject to time or cosmic cycles.

  Śaṅkara clarifies that this "another unmanifest" is distinguished from the previously mentioned one which serves as the seed for all beings in samsāra. The previously mentioned "unmanifest" is associated with ignorance (avidyā) and the seed-state of beings, subject to appearing and disappearing in Brahmā's day and night. In contrast, this higher unmanifest is absolutely different—this is the supreme Brahman, eternal and never subject to any dissolution.

- **"Yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu na vinaśyati"**:
  All beings, including even gods and high realms, eventually perish. Yet this higher reality, the supreme Brahman, does not perish. It remains unaffected by cosmic dissolutions. This line cements Brahman’s transcendence over all temporal existence. Brahman stands beyond cycles of manifestation and dissolution that characterize lesser unmanifest states and worlds.

Śaṅkara points out that the text introduced Omkāra and the means to attain Brahman. Now it clarifies Brahman’s nature further. The first unmanifest state is still a product of Māyā and thus perishable at the end of cosmic cycles. The second, higher "unmanifest" is the ultimate Reality, Brahman, never destroyed, never changing.

**Philosophical and Practical Significance:**

- **Two Levels of Unmanifest:**
  The Gita distinguishes between:
  1. The "lower unmanifest" (mūlaprakṛti), from which universes emerge and into which they return. This is subject to change and time—hence impermanent.
  2. The "higher unmanifest," the eternal Brahman, beyond even primal matter, timeless and immutable.

- **Impermanence of the Lower Unmanifest:**
  Even what seems like a primordial seed-state of the cosmos is subject to time-bound cycles. This underscores that no refuge can be found in anything within samsāra—not even in primal matter or the grand cosmic seed-state.

- **Eternal Refuge in Brahman:**
  Since beings and worlds perish, and even primal states of matter eventually change, the aspirant should aim beyond these, toward the Highest Reality—Brahman. Understanding Brahman’s timeless, unchanging nature spurs the seeker to go beyond all conditional realities, all creations and dissolutions, and rest in that which is never destroyed.

- **Spiritual Aspiration:**
  This verse encourages seeking Brahman, the ultimate permanent refuge. Knowledge of cosmic impermanence instills deeper dispassion (vairāgya) and motivates the practitioner to realize Brahman, ensuring escape from the grand cosmic cycles.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

The "Path to the Supreme" involves traversing beyond all relative states, including high heavens, subtle unmanifest realms, and cosmic seeds of creation. This verse points to the highest reality, Brahman, distinct even from the avyakta seed-state. Samyama and meditation, as discussed previously, direct the mind from form to formless, from changing manifestations to the changeless Brahman, culminating in liberation.

The Gita, step by step, leads the seeker from recognizing impermanence in all worlds to focusing on the eternal Brahman. By understanding that even primal states of existence are time-bound, the seeker is left with only one rational goal: to attain that eternal, transcendent Brahman, thereby completing the journey on the Path to the Supreme.

**Conclusion:**

Verse 20 reveals that beyond the impermanent unmanifest realm lies another, higher unmanifest—the eternal Brahman, immune to cosmic dissolutions. This clarifies the ultimate goal and refuge for spiritual seekers: transcending all temporal states and realizing the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate and unchanging reality.
