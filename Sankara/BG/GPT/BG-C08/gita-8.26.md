**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Śukla-kṛṣṇe gatī hy ete"**: The bright (śukla) and dark (kṛṣṇa) paths have been discussed in the previous verses. Śaṅkara explains that *śukla* (bright) is associated with the illuminating quality, often linked with knowledge and auspicious conditions leading to no return, while *kṛṣṇa* (dark) is associated with the absence of that brightness, corresponding to the path that leads back to samsāra after one’s merits are exhausted.

- **"Jagataḥ śāśvate mate"**: These two paths are considered eternal, meaning they are perpetually available and recognized in the cosmic order. Since samsāra (the cycle of birth and death) is eternal, these two routes—one leading out of samsāra permanently, another leading back into it—are ever-present possibilities for departing souls.

- **"Ekayā yāty anāvṛttim"**: By following the bright path described earlier (in verse 24), a person attains *anāvṛtti*, the state of no return, i.e., liberation from samsāra. This path is associated with having lived a life of Brahman-upāsanā, devotion, and correct spiritual alignment so that at death one traverses through the bright route and never returns.

- **"Anyayā āvartate punaḥ"**: By the other path (the dark path described in verse 25), one returns again to samsāra after enjoying the fruits of their good actions in a heavenly realm. This second path is associated with those who may have done pious deeds (karmīs) but not achieved full knowledge or devotion capable of granting liberation. Thus, they go temporarily to lunar regions (Pitṛloka) and then must come back to the earthly plane after their accumulated merit is exhausted.

**Key Distinction According to Śaṅkara:**
- The bright path is for those with knowledge and devotion aimed at the Supreme Reality, granting them non-return and leading ultimately to Brahman-realization (whether immediate or gradual).
- The dark path is for those who have done good deeds but remain entangled in desire and ignorance. They ascend to a heavenly state, then inevitably descend back into the cycle of birth and death.

**Philosophical Context:**

This verse concludes the explanation of the two post-mortem routes: the “Northern/bright” (śukla) path leading toward liberation, and the “Southern/dark” (kṛṣṇa) path leading back into samsāra. The Gita aligns with Upanishadic teachings (notably in the Chāndogya and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishads) that mention these paths.

The eternal existence of these two paths serves as a cosmic principle, reflecting the dual nature of spiritual outcomes: one permanent (liberation), one temporary (heavenly enjoyment followed by return).

---

**Practical Implications:**

For the spiritual aspirant, understanding these paths is a caution and encouragement:
- Caution: Relying on good deeds alone without true knowledge and devotion leads only to temporary uplift and eventual return.
- Encouragement: Cultivating knowledge (jñāna), unwavering devotion (bhakti), and meditative integration (samādhi) ensures a final departure along the bright path, guaranteeing no return to suffering.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

We started with recognizing samsāra’s impermanence and suffering. The Gita explained cosmic cycles and distinguished between lesser achievements (heavens, lunar realms) and the ultimate attainment (Brahman). Now, summarizing the two paths makes the choice clear: aim for the bright path and final liberation rather than be content with transient heavenly pleasures. Understanding these two eternal paths helps the seeker commit fully to the spiritual practices leading to the Supreme, completing the Gita’s teaching on life’s ultimate end.

---

**Conclusion:**

Verse 26 states that these two paths—bright and dark—are eternal aspects of cosmic law. By one, the realized soul never returns (liberation), and by the other, the soul returns to the cycle of rebirth. This reaffirms the Gita’s central theme: true spiritual endeavor guided by knowledge and devotion leads to permanent freedom, while partial efforts yield only temporary respite.
