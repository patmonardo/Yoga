### Translation

**"Adhibhūta (the basis of all physical beings) is the perishable nature; the Puruṣa (Cosmic Spirit) is the Adhidaiva (the presiding deity); I alone am the Adhiyajña (Lord of sacrifices) here in this body, O best of embodied beings."**

**Commentary:**

"Adhibhūta refers to that which exists with respect to beings—the perishable nature. What is that? 'Kṣara'—that which decays or perishes—is called 'kṣara.' 'Bhāvaḥ' means any entity that is subject to birth—that is, any mutable, material object.

'Puruṣa' can mean 'one who fills all' (pūrṇam anena sarvam) or 'one who dwells in the city (body)' (puri śayanāt). Here, it refers to Hiraṇyagarbha, situated within the sun (Āditya), who bestows favor upon all the organs of beings. He is the Adhidaiva (presiding deity).

'Adhiyajña' is the deity known as Viṣṇu, who is the presiding Lord of all sacrifices. As the scripture states, 'Yajña (sacrifice) is indeed Viṣṇu' (Taittirīya Saṁhitā 1.7.4). That Viṣṇu is indeed Myself. Here, in this body, I am the Adhiyajña—the Lord of the sacrifice performed in the body. Since sacrifice is carried out by the body and inheres in it, it is based in the body (dehādhikaraṇa), O best of the embodied beings."
