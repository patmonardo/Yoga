**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ"**: The term *puruṣa* can be understood in two etymological ways:
  1. *Puri śayanāt*: He who dwells in the 'pura' (city), i.e., the body or the universe.
  2. *Pūrṇatvāt*: Because He is all-pervading and complete, He is called Puruṣa.

  *Paraḥ* means 'supreme,' indicating that there is nothing beyond or higher than this Puruṣa. He is niratiśayaḥ—unsurpassed, the ultimate reality.

- **"Bhaktyā labhyaḥ tu ananyayā"**: This Supreme Being is attainable by *bhakti*—devotion characterized by knowledge and single-mindedness. *Ananyayā* means 'undivided,' 'not directed towards anything else.' Thus, the Supreme is reached by a form of devotion that does not depend on any other support and is solely focused on the Supreme Person. This devotion is essentially a form of love and knowledge combined, directed exclusively towards Him.

  Śaṅkara clarifies that this devotion (bhakti) is not blind emotion alone, but endowed with the discernment that He is the ultimate reality. It’s a single-pointed, unwavering devotion.

- **"Yasya antaḥsthāni bhūtāni"**: 'Antaḥsthāni' means 'inside, within.' All beings exist within this Supreme Puruṣa as effects reside in their cause. Since the cause encompasses the effect internally, all creatures (bhūtāni) are contained within this Supreme Person, who is their ultimate support and source.

- **"Yena sarvam idaṁ tatam"**: By whom all this (the universe) is pervaded. He pervades everything, just as space pervades all forms such as jars and pots. This underscores His all-encompassing presence. Nothing exists outside His being.

**Conclusion from Śaṅkara’s Perspective:**

The verse teaches that while the supreme Brahman was previously described as beyond even the unmanifest, here it is indicated that the Supreme Person is indeed that same ultimate reality (paramāṁ gatim) discussed earlier. He is reachable only by unalloyed devotion—devotion not mixed with any other object or goal.

Having recognized the impermanent cycles of creation and dissolution in earlier verses, and having seen that all worlds and beings come and go, we are now given the means to transcend these cycles: unwavering devotion to the Supreme Person who pervades everything and within whom all beings are contained. Attaining Him ensures freedom from the cycle of samsāra.

**Philosophical Context:**

- **Devotion as the Means:** After elaborating on cosmic impermanence, the Gita prescribes devotion (bhakti) as the surest means to realize the permanent and ultimate truth. This devotion must be exclusive (ananyā) because any duality of focus dilutes the direct experience of the Supreme.

- **Supreme Person and Brahman:** Although the verse uses 'Puruṣaḥ' and 'Paramam dhāma' indicating a personal dimension to the Absolute, Śaṅkara understands this Supreme Person as none other than the highest Brahman, often identified with Viṣṇu or the Supreme Lord. The personal form is a helpful means, yet what is attained is the nondual reality itself.

- **No Return upon Attainment:** This verse in conjunction with previous ones indicates that attaining the Supreme Person frees one from return to ephemeral states of being. This resonates with the Upanishadic teachings that realization of Brahman leads to mokṣa, the end of all becoming.

**Practical Implications:**

For the seeker, the method is clear: cultivate unwavering, exclusive devotion. Such devotion involves both heartfelt dedication and correct insight into the nature of the Supreme. By constantly directing one’s thought and love towards Him, one’s consciousness becomes fit to realize the Supreme Abode, beyond all impermanence and suffering.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

We have been exploring a conceptual journey from the impermanence of cosmic realms, through the recognition of Brahman as the ultimate refuge, and culminating in the practice necessary to reach that refuge. This verse firmly states that devotion (bhakti) is the direct means. It complements the earlier instructions on single-pointed meditation and control of senses, merging knowledge, devotion, and unwavering focus into one stream of spiritual effort that leads to the Supreme.

---

**Final Summary:**

Verse 22 (just concluded previously) clarified the nature of the Supreme Goal, and now Verse 21 instructs that to attain this Supreme Person, unwavering devotion is required. Now, Verse 22 (as we have done) reaffirms that this Supreme Person stands beyond all realms and is the ultimate reality. Having clarified the ultimate goal and the means (unalloyed devotion), we firmly establish that no lesser attainment can secure liberation. The seeker is thus guided to adopt a singular devotion to the Supreme, ensuring no return to the cycle of birth and death.
