Below is Verse 21 with a careful translation, word-by-word meaning, and commentary drawing on Śaṅkarācārya’s bhāṣya. We will also integrate the philosophical context we have developed, including the distinctions between Brahman, Purusha, Prakriti, and how this ultimate state relates to the previously discussed concepts of the unmanifest.

**Verse 21 (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 8)**

**Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary:**

- **"Avyakto ’kṣara ity uktas…"**: The unmanifest, which was previously identified as akṣara (imperishable), is now proclaimed as the supreme goal (paramāṁ gatim). This clarifies that the Reality described as 'beyond the unmanifest' in previous verses (Verse 20) is indeed the ultimate end sought by all spiritual aspirants.

- **"Tam āhuḥ paramāṁ gatim"**: This very unmanifest, eternal essence is recognized by the wise as the highest possible attainment—far surpassing any temporal or cosmic achievement, including residence in the highest celestial realms or Brahmaloka.

- **"Yaṁ prāpya na nivartante"**: Attaining this supreme Reality, beings do not return to samsāra, the cycle of birth and death. Unlike beings who ascend to higher realms yet still remain bound by time and cyclical existence, those who realize this supreme Brahman abide beyond all cycles—no rebirth, no return.

- **"Tad dhāma paramaṁ mama"**: The term 'dhāma' suggests an 'abode' or ultimate 'state.' The Supreme Lord indicates that this is His highest abode—also termed 'Viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam' (the supreme state of Viṣṇu). It conveys that the ultimate Reality, while formless and beyond attributes, is still the essence of the Divine Lord's own transcendental position.

Śaṅkara uses this verse to reinforce that the previously described unmanifest and imperishable Reality is indeed Brahman, the ultimate refuge from impermanence and ignorance. It transcends even the subtlest aspects of creation and cosmic seed-states described earlier.

**Philosophical Context:**

We have previously acknowledged that:

- **Brahman is beyond Purusha and Prakriti**: Purusha (pure consciousness) and Prakriti (primordial nature) are distinct principles in Sankhya-Yoga contexts. Brahman, however, is the ultimate nondual ground beyond even these conceptual dualities. Purusha and Prakriti help describe the cosmos and the embodied soul’s entanglement, but Brahman underlies and transcends these categories.

- **The 'Absolute Idea' and 8-fold Prakriti**: In earlier commentary, we noted that the Gita mentions the 8-fold Prakriti (earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, and ego) as the lower nature of the Lord, while there is a higher reality beyond it. The 'Absolute Idea' you mentioned can be likened to the pure intelligence or citi underlying even buddhi and citta. Yet all of these remain within the sphere of manifestation (even subtle manifestation). Brahman stands apart—neither merely 'in itself' nor 'for another'—it is utterly nondual and beyond relational existence.

- **Two Levels of Unmanifest**: The earlier verses distinguished between a lower unmanifest (seed state of cosmic manifestations) and a higher unmanifest (the eternal Brahman). Now Verse 21 makes explicit that the higher unmanifest (akṣara, eternal Brahman) is indeed the final and supreme goal.

- **No Return Post-Liberation**: Attaining Brahman means the jīva (individual self) is no longer subject to any form of becoming or returning. Liberation (mokṣa) is final and absolute.

**Practical Import:**

- **Inspiration for Seekers**: Understanding that even the subtlest cosmic states and highest realms do not grant permanent escape from the cycle of samsāra encourages the seeker to direct their efforts towards realizing Brahman, the supreme state.

- **Single Ultimate Goal**: The text consolidates spiritual endeavor into a single ultimate aim—Brahman realization—freeing the aspirant from confusion about partial or intermediate goals.

**Connection to the Path to the Supreme:**

As we integrate Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, and Samyama with knowledge of cosmic impermanence, devotion to the Supreme, and the distinction between lower and higher unmanifest states, we see that all yoga and devotion aim toward Brahman-realization. This verse acts as a milestone: having identified that Brahman is the eternal reality beyond all cyclic existence, the Gita now confirms that reaching this reality—attaining Om-based meditation, Ishvara devotion, and higher discernment—secures a final and irreversible liberation.

---

**Conclusion:**

Verse 21 confirms that the unmanifest, imperishable Brahman previously described is indeed the Supreme Goal. Attaining this transcendental Reality ensures the end of all return to conditional existence. The realization that nothing short of Brahman-liberation grants permanent freedom underscores the importance of focusing spiritual effort on reaching that supreme abode—thereby completing the journey on the Path to the Supreme.
