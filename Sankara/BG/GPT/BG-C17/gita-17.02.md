#### Translation

### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that faith (*śraddhā*) manifests in three kinds, as you inquire about their steadfastness (*niṣṭhāyāṁ*):
- **Sattvikī**: Associated with pure, virtuous worship (*devapūjādiviṣayā*).
- **Rajasi**: Linked to passionate, active worship (*yakṣarakṣapūjādiviṣayā*).
- **Tāmasī**: Connected to ignorant, deluded worship (*pretapiśācādipūjāvishayā*).

Thus, hear the description of faith as Sattvik, Rajasic, and Tamasic, which arises from the inherent nature (*svabhāvajā*) of embodied beings, influenced by their karmic engagements and societal conditioning.

### IV. Dialectical Structure

1. **Movement One**: **Enumeration of Faith's Forms and Their Nature**
   - The verse outlines that faith (*śraddhā*) manifests in three forms—Sattvic (*sāttvikī*), Rajasic (*rājasī*), and Tamasic (*tāmasī*)—each arising from the inherent nature (*svabhāvajā*) of embodied beings (*dehinām*).

2. **Movement Two**: **Śaṅkara’s Detailed Explanation and Interpretation**
   - Śaṅkara’s Bhāṣya elaborates that these three forms of faith are products of one's inherent nature, influenced by their karmic engagements and societal conditioning. Sattvic faith is associated with pure and virtuous worship, Rajasic faith with passionate and active worship, and Tamasic faith with ignorant and deluded worship.

3. **Synthesis/Resolution**: **Integration into a Comprehensive Ethical Framework**
   - The synthesis integrates the threefold nature of faith into a broader ethical and philosophical framework, illustrating how different modes of faith influence one's worship practices and spiritual progress. Śaṅkara emphasizes the importance of cultivating Sattvic faith for spiritual purity and advancement, while cautioning against Rajasic and Tamasic faiths that can lead to moral and spiritual degradation.

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of distinguishing between Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic faith on an individual's behavior and spiritual progress. For instance, individuals with Sattvic faith engage in pure and virtuous worship, promoting personal and societal well-being, while those with Rajasic and Tamasic faith may experience moral and spiritual challenges.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between the types of faith and their outcomes. Understanding how Sattvic faith leads to spiritual advancement, whereas Rajasic and Tamasic faith can lead to ethical and spiritual obstacles, rationalizes the importance of cultivating pure faith for spiritual liberation.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing the three forms of faith to understanding their philosophical and ethical implications.
  - Investigate how cultivating Sattvic faith fosters ethical living and spiritual growth, while Rajasic and Tamasic faiths may hinder these processes.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Sattvic Faith (*sāttvikī*)**: Compare with Buddhist *sīla* (ethical conduct) and Yogic *sattva* (purity), emphasizing virtuous and disciplined practices.
  - **Rajasic Faith (*rājasī*)**: Relate to Buddhist *rāga* (attachment) and Yogic *rajas* (passion), highlighting desires and active engagements that can lead to attachment and suffering.
  - **Tamasic Faith (*tāmasī*)**: Align with Buddhist *moha* (delusion) and Yogic *tamas* (ignorance), focusing on delusion and inertia that obstruct spiritual clarity and progress.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic approach where Sattvic faith aligns the individual with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight how overcoming Rajasic and Tamasic faiths purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles, consistent with Advaita Vedanta's non-dual philosophy.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *sāttvikī*, *rājasī*, *tāmasī*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Sattvic Faith (*sāttvikī*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *sīla* (ethical conduct), fostering virtuous and disciplined behavior that leads to spiritual progress.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *sattva* (purity), emphasizing clarity, harmony, and virtuous practices essential for spiritual advancement.

  - **Rajasic Faith (*rājasī*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects *rāga* (attachment), which binds individuals to desires and leads to suffering.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with *rajas* (passion), highlighting active engagement driven by desires and attachment to material pursuits.

  - **Tamasic Faith (*tāmasī*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Aligns with *moha* (delusion), which clouds judgment and impedes spiritual clarity.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *tamas* (ignorance), emphasizing lethargy, delusion, and obstacles to spiritual progress.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the cultivation of ethical conduct and purity (*sīla*, *sattva*) for spiritual advancement.
  - The elimination of attachment (*rāga*, *rajas*) and delusion (*moha*, *tamas*) is essential for achieving spiritual clarity and liberation, aligning with Advaita Vedanta’s emphasis on overcoming negative traits.

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *sāttvikī* with Buddhist *sīla* and Yogic *sattva*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where Sattvic faith aligns the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), facilitating spiritual liberation.
  - Rajasic and Tamasic faiths are seen as obstacles that create dualistic separations, hindering the realization of oneness with Brahman.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how different forms of faith influence spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how disciplined action and inner purification, guided by Sattvic faith, are essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Actions performed with Sattvic faith transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of cultivating Sattvic faith exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**:
  - Integrate insights from the Bhagavad Gītā, Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya, and Buddhist-Abhidharma perspectives to present a comprehensive view of how different forms of faith influence spiritual liberation.
  - Highlight the interconnectedness of ethical virtues (*daivī sampad*) and the elimination of negative traits (*āsurī sampad*) through cultivating Sattvic faith in achieving self-realization and harmony with the universe.

- **Systematic Development**:
  - Progress from the enumeration of faith's forms to their philosophical implications, demonstrating how each form contributes to spiritual and moral upliftment or degradation.
  - Show the transition from recognizing different types of faith to understanding their impact on one's spiritual journey and the necessity of cultivating Sattvic faith for liberation.

- **Meaningful Synthesis**:
  - Highlight the convergence of Hindu and Buddhist philosophies in promoting the cultivation of ethical and pure faith while eliminating attachment and delusion.
  - Emphasize how integrated practices from both traditions foster ethical conduct, mental purification, and selfless action, leading to a non-dual understanding of existence and ultimate liberation.
  - Illustrate the practical application of cultivating Sattvic faith in daily life, contributing to personal growth and societal well-being.
