#### Translation

```markdown
### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that speech (*vākyaṁ*) which is free from agitation (*anudvega*), truthful (*satyaṁ*), and beneficial (*priyahitaṁ*),
along with self-study and practice (*svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ*) associated with eloquent speech (*vāṅmayamayaṁ*),
is called austerity (*tapaḥ*).
Such speech is aligned with Sattvic qualities because it promotes truth, love, and well-being without causing distress or agitation.
For example, commands like "Be peaceful, O son; continue your self-study and yoga, thus you will prosper" exemplify Sattvic speech.
Therefore, self-study and practice performed with sincere intent and aligned with Sattvic speech are considered Sattvic austerity. ॥15॥
