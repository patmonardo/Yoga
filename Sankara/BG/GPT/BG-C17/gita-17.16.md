### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that peace of mind (*manaḥprasādaḥ*), gentleness (*saumyatvaṁ*), silence (*maunam*), self-control (*ātmanigrahah*), and purity of emotions (*bhavasamśuddhi*) constitute austerity (*tapaḥ*). This austerity aligns with Sattvic qualities, as it brings about mental tranquility (*praśāntiḥ*), gentleness (*saumyam*), silence (*maunam*), self-control (*ātmanigraham*), and emotional purity (*bhavasamśuddhim*). Therefore, such austerity is called mental austerity (*mānasamucyate*), which regulates the self, promotes peace, gentleness, silence, and purifies emotions. ॥16॥
