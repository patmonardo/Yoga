# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 22

### Introduction

Continuing from the previous verse, where the Lord explains how He strengthens the faith of devotees who worship various deities driven by their desires, this verse elaborates on how these devotees, endowed with the faith granted by the Supreme, engage in worship and attain their desired outcomes. The Lord reveals that even the results obtained from worshiping other deities ultimately come from Him.

### Sanskrit

**स तया श्रद्धया युक्तस्तस्या राधनमीहते ।
लभते च ततः कामान् मयैव विहितान् हि तान् ॥ २२ ॥**

**Commentary:**

स तया मद्विहितया श्रद्धया युक्तः सन् तस्याः देवता-तनुः आराधनम् ईहते चेष्टते। लभते च ततः तस्याः आराधितायाः देवता-तनुः कामान् ईप्सितान् मयैव परमेश्वरेण सर्वज्ञेन कर्म-फल-विभाग-ज्ञतया विहितान् निर्मितान् तान्, हि यस्मात् ते भगवता विहिताः कामाः तस्मात् तान् अवश्यं लभते इत्यर्थः। 'हितान्' इति पदच्छेदे हितत्वं कामानाम् उपचरितं कल्प्यम्; न हि कामाः हिताः कस्यचित् ॥ २२ ॥

### Transliteration

**Sa tayā śraddhayā yuktas tasyāḥ ārādhanam īhate |
Labhate ca tataḥ kāmān mayāiva vihitān hi tān || 22 ||**

**Commentary:**

*Sa tayā mad-vihitayā śraddhayā yuktaḥ san tasyāḥ devatā-tanuḥ ārādhanam īhate ceṣṭate. Labhate ca tataḥ tasyāḥ ārādhitāyāḥ devatā-tanuḥ kāmān īpsitān mayā eva parameśvareṇa sarvajñena karma-phala-vibhāga-jñatayā vihitān nirmitān tān, hi yasmāt te bhagavatā vihitāḥ kāmāḥ tasmāt tān avaśyaṁ labhate ity arthaḥ. 'Hitān' iti pada-cchede hitatvaṁ kāmānām upacaritam kalpyam; na hi kāmāḥ hitāḥ kasyacit. || 22 ||*

### Translation

**"Endowed with that faith, he seeks the worship of that deity and obtains his desires, which are indeed granted by Me alone."**

**Commentary:**

"Endowed with the faith established by Me, he engages in the worship (ārādhana) of that particular form of the deity. He then obtains from that deity his desired objects, which are indeed granted by Me, the Supreme Lord, who is omniscient and knows the proper dispensation of the fruits of actions. Since these desired objects are granted by the Lord, he surely obtains them—that is the meaning. In the splitting of the word 'vihitān hi tān,' if read as 'hitān,' the supposed benefit of the desires is figurative; for in reality, desires are not beneficial to anyone."

## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

स तया मद्विहितया श्रद्धया युक्तः सन् तस्याः देवता-तनुः आराधनम् ईहते चेष्टते। लभते च ततः तस्याः आराधितायाः देवता-तनुः कामान् ईप्सितान् मयैव परमेश्वरेण सर्वज्ञेन कर्म-फल-विभाग-ज्ञतया विहितान् निर्मितान् तान्, हि यस्मात् ते भगवता विहिताः कामाः तस्मात् तान् अवश्यं लभते इत्यर्थः। 'हितान्' इति पदच्छेदे हितत्वं कामानाम् उपचरितं कल्प्यम्; न हि कामाः हिताः कस्यचित् ॥ २२ ॥

### Transliteration

*Sa tayā mad-vihitayā śraddhayā yuktaḥ san tasyāḥ devatā-tanuḥ ārādhanam īhate ceṣṭate. Labhate ca tataḥ tasyāḥ ārādhitāyāḥ devatā-tanuḥ kāmān īpsitān mayā eva parameśvareṇa sarvajñena karma-phala-vibhāga-jñatayā vihitān nirmitān tān, hi yasmāt te bhagavatā vihitāḥ kāmāḥ tasmāt tān avaśyaṁ labhate ity arthaḥ. 'Hitān' iti pada-cchede hitatvaṁ kāmānām upacaritam kalpyam; na hi kāmāḥ hitāḥ kasyacit. || 22 ||*

### Translation

"Endowed with the faith established by Me, he engages in the worship of that particular form of the deity. He then obtains from that deity the desired objects, which are indeed granted by Me, the Supreme Lord, who, being omniscient, knows the proper allocation of the fruits of actions. Since these desires are granted by the Lord, he surely obtains them—that is the meaning. If, in splitting the words, it is read as 'hitān,' implying 'beneficial,' then the supposed benefit of the desires is figurative; for indeed, desires are not truly beneficial to anyone."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Phenomena and Noumena**: The desires and their fulfillment belong to the phenomenal world of appearances, while the Lord represents the noumenal reality beyond sensory experience.

2. **Moral Law and Duty**: Acting out of desire is driven by inclinations rather than adherence to the moral law dictated by pure reason.

3. **Divine Justice**: The Lord dispensing results according to the law of karma aligns with Kant's concept of a moral order underpinning the universe.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego and Individual Will**: The devotee's desires represent the individual will, which must eventually align with the Absolute Ego (the Divine Will) for true liberation.

2. **Role of Desire in Self-Realization**: While desires can motivate action, they ultimately need to be transcended to realize the true self.

3. **Divine Assistance**: The Lord's role in granting desires can be seen as facilitating the individual's journey toward self-awareness and eventual union with the Absolute.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Progression**:

   - **Thesis**: The devotee desires specific outcomes and worships accordingly.
   - **Antithesis**: The realization that fulfillment of desires does not lead to lasting satisfaction.
   - **Synthesis**: Movement toward seeking the Absolute, transcending limited desires.

2. **Universal Spirit**: The Lord represents the Absolute Spirit, guiding individuals through their experiences toward self-realization.

3. **Inevitability of Return to the Absolute**: Despite temporary diversions, all souls are ultimately drawn back to the Absolute.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord reveals that He is the ultimate source of all benefits obtained through worship, even when devotees worship other deities driven by their desires. He strengthens their faith and enables them to attain their desired objects, but these fulfillments are temporary and keep them within the cycle of samsara (worldly existence).

The Lord's compassionate facilitation allows devotees to pursue their paths, but He also subtly guides them toward the ultimate realization that true fulfillment lies beyond transient desires. Recognizing the Lord as the supreme granter of all results encourages devotees to seek deeper understanding and align their devotion toward the Absolute.
