# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 12

### Introduction

The Lord continues to explain how all phenomena, whether characterized by the qualities of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), or tamas (ignorance), emanate from Him. However, He also clarifies His transcendence over these qualities, emphasizing that while they arise from Him, He is not dependent on or affected by them.

### Sanskrit

किञ्च —

ये चैव सात्त्विका भावा राजसास्तमसाश्च ये ।
मत्त एवेति तान्विद्धि न त्वहं तेषु ते मयि ॥ १२ ॥

**Commentary:**

ये चैव सात्त्विकाः सत्त्वनिर्वृत्ताः भावाः पदार्थाः, राजसाः रजोनिर्वृत्ताः, तामसाः तमोनिर्वृत्ताश्च, ये केचित् प्राणिनां स्वकर्मवशात् जायन्ते भावाः, तान् मत्त एव जायमानान् इति एवं विद्धि सर्वान् समस्तानेव । यद्यपि ते मत्तः जायन्ते, तथापि न तु अहं तेषु तदधीनः तद्वशः, यथा संसारिणः । ते पुनः मयि मद्वशाः मदधीनाः ॥ १२ ॥

### Transliteration

**Kiñca —**

*Ye caiva sāttvikā bhāvā rājasās tamasāś ca ye |
Matta eveti tān viddhi na tv ahaṁ teṣu te mayi || 12 ||

Ye caiva sāttvikāḥ sattva-nirvṛttāḥ bhāvāḥ padārthāḥ, rājasāḥ rajo-nirvṛttāḥ, tāmasāḥ tamo-nirvṛttāś ca, ye kecit prāṇināṁ sva-karma-vaśāt jāyante bhāvāḥ, tān matta eva jāyamānān iti evaṁ viddhi sarvān samastān eva. Yadyapi te mattaḥ jāyante, tathāpi na tu ahaṁ teṣu tad-adhīnaḥ tad-vaśaḥ, yathā saṁsāriṇaḥ. Te punaḥ mayi mad-vaśāḥ mad-adhīnāḥ. || 12 ||*

### Translation

**Furthermore:**

"Whatever beings are of the nature of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), or tamas (ignorance)—know that they all arise from Me alone. But I am not in them; they are in Me."

**Commentary:**

"Whatever entities are sattvic—originating from the quality of sattva—whatever objects exist; rajasic—originating from the quality of rajas; tamasic—originating from the quality of tamas; whatever dispositions arise in living beings due to their own actions (karma), know all of them as indeed arising from Me alone, all of them without exception. Although they are born from Me, I am not in them, not dependent on or controlled by them, as worldly beings are. Rather, they are in Me, under My control, dependent on Me."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Noumenon and Phenomenon**:

   - **Noumenal Self**: The Lord represents the noumenal reality, beyond sensory experience and qualities.

   - **Phenomenal World**: The qualities (gunas) are phenomena that arise in the sensory world.

2. **Transcendental Idealism**:

   - The Lord as the source of all phenomena but not affected by them aligns with Kant's idea of the thing-in-itself being beyond empirical qualities.

3. **Moral Autonomy**:

   - The Lord's independence from qualities reflects the autonomy of the moral law, which is not influenced by empirical desires.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Absolute Ego**:

   - The Lord symbolizes the Absolute Ego, from which all reality is posited.

2. **Self-Positing and Not-Self**:

   - The gunas represent the not-self, arising from the Absolute Ego but distinct from it.

3. **Freedom and Determination**:

   - Beings are determined by the gunas due to karma, while the Absolute Ego remains free.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The Absolute (Lord) as pure being.

   - **Antithesis**: The manifestation of qualities (gunas) in the world.

   - **Synthesis**: The realization that the Absolute encompasses all qualities yet transcends them.

2. **Absolute Spirit**:

   - The Lord is the Absolute Spirit that manifests the world through the gunas but remains unaffected.

3. **Unity of Opposites**:

   - The Lord contains both the manifestation (qualities) and transcendence (beyond qualities), unifying them in His being.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord explains that all phenomena characterized by the qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas arise from Him. However, He remains unattached and uninfluenced by these qualities, highlighting His transcendental nature. Beings, influenced by their own karma, develop dispositions based on these gunas, leading to their entanglement in the material world.

The technical analysis elucidates the key terms and structural elements, emphasizing the Lord's role as the source and His transcendence over the manifested qualities. The German Idealist perspectives provide philosophical parallels, exploring themes of noumenal reality, the Absolute Ego, and the dialectical process of manifestation and transcendence.

Understanding this verse encourages recognition of the Divine as the ultimate source while acknowledging His independence from material attributes. It invites individuals to seek the transcendental reality beyond the fleeting qualities that govern worldly existence.
