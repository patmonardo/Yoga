## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

रसः अहम्, अपां यः सारः स रसः, तस्मिन् रसभूते मयि आपः प्रोता इत्यर्थः। एवं सर्वत्र। यथा अहम् अप्सु रसः, एवं प्रभा अस्मि शशि-सूर्ययोः। प्रणवः ओङ्कारः सर्ववेदेषु, तस्मिन् प्रणवभूते मयि सर्वे वेदाः प्रोताः। तथा खे आकाशे शब्दः सारभूतः, तस्मिन् मयि खं प्रोतम्। तथा पौरुषं पुरुषस्य भावः पौरुषं यतः पुम्बुद्धिः नृषु, तस्मिन् मयि पुरुषाः प्रोताः ॥ ८ ॥

### Transliteration

*Rasaḥ aham, apāṁ yaḥ sāraḥ sa rasaḥ, tasmin rasa-bhūte mayi āpaḥ protā ity arthaḥ. Evaṁ sarvatra. Yathā aham apsu rasaḥ, evaṁ prabhā asmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ. Praṇavaḥ oṅkāraḥ sarva-vedeṣu, tasmin praṇava-bhūte mayi sarve vedāḥ protāḥ. Tathā khe ākāśe śabdaḥ sāra-bhūtaḥ, tasmin mayi khaṁ protam. Tathā pauruṣaṁ puruṣasya bhāvaḥ pauruṣaṁ yataḥ pumbuddhiḥ nṛṣu, tasmin mayi puruṣāḥ protāḥ. || 8 ||

### Translation

"I am the taste—the essence in water, which is taste; in that essence, which is Myself, water is strung—that is the meaning. Similarly everywhere. Just as I am the taste in water, so too I am the light in the moon and sun. I am the Pranava (Oṁkāra) in all the Vedas; in that Pranava-form, which is Myself, all the Vedas are strung. Likewise, in space (ākāśa), the sound which is the essence; in that which is Myself, space is strung. Similarly, manhood—the essential nature of manhood in men, from which arises the masculine sense; in that which is Myself, men are strung."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Aesthetics**:
   - **Forms of Intuition**: Space and time as necessary conditions for experience are paralleled by the Lord being the sound in space and taste in water.
   - **Sensory Experience**: The taste and light represent phenomena perceived through the senses, with the Lord as their foundational essence.

2. **Noumenon and Phenomenon**:
   - **Essence vs. Appearance**: The Lord as the noumenal reality (essence) behind the phenomenal world (appearance of elements).

3. **Unity of Apperception**:
   - **Unifying Principle**: The Lord unifies diverse sensory experiences, allowing for coherent perception of the universe.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Self-Positing Ego**:
   - **Consciousness and Reality**: The identification of the Lord with essential qualities reflects the self's active role in constructing reality.

2. **Activity of the Self**:
   - **Creation of Meaning**: The self (Divine) imparts essence to the elements, similar to how the ego generates meaning in experiences.

3. **Dialectical Movement**:
   - **Thesis**: Elements perceived as independent.
   - **Antithesis**: Recognition of the Divine essence within them.
   - **Synthesis**: Understanding the unity of self and elements through the Divine.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Process**:
   - **Being-in-Itself**: The Lord as pure essence existing independently.
   - **Being-for-Itself**: Elements manifesting with distinct identities.
   - **Being-in-and-for-Itself**: The realization of the unity between the Divine and elements.

2. **Absolute Spirit**:
   - **Manifestation**: The Lord as the Absolute Spirit expresses Himself through various forms and qualities in the universe.

3. **Unity of Universals and Particulars**:
   - **Expressions of the Divine**: Particular qualities (taste, light, sound) are manifestations of the universal Divine essence.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord elucidates how He is the foundational essence within various elements and beings. By declaring Himself as the taste in water, the light in the sun and moon, the sacred syllable Om in the Vedas, the sound in space, and the manhood in men, He emphasizes His pervasive presence throughout the cosmos.

The commentary expands on this by explaining that these essential qualities are the means by which the elements and beings are woven into the Divine. This demonstrates the intimate relationship between the universe and the Divine, where all existence is dependent on and unified by the Lord's essence.

The technical analysis clarifies the key terms and their interrelations, while the German Idealist perspectives draw parallels with Western philosophical concepts, highlighting the universality of these profound ideas.
