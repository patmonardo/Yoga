# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 6

### Introduction

The Lord continues to expound on the relationship between His material and spiritual energies, emphasizing that all beings originate from these two Prakritis (natures) and that He is the ultimate source and dissolution of the universe. This verse reinforces the understanding of the Divine as both the material and efficient cause of all existence.

**Commentary:**

*Etad-yonīni ete parāpare kṣetra-kṣetrajña-lakṣaṇe prakṛtī yoniḥ yeṣāṁ bhūtānāṁ tāni etad-yonīni, bhūtāni sarvāṇi iti evam upadhāraya jānīhi.

### Translation

"Understand that all beings have these two natures as their origin. I am the origin of the entire universe and also its dissolution."

**Commentary:**

"Know that all beings, whose source is these two Prakritis—superior and inferior, characterized as the field (kṣetra) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña)—are born of these; thus, understand that all beings have this as their origin. Since My Prakritis are the cause of all beings, therefore, I am the origin (creation) and dissolution (destruction) of the entire universe. Through the means of these two Prakritis, I, the omniscient Lord, am the cause of the universe."

### Sanskrit

एतद्योनीनि एते परापरे क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञलक्षणे प्रकृती योनिः येषां भूतानां तानि एतद्योनीनि, भूतानि सर्वाणि इति एवम् उपधारय जानीहि। यस्मात् मम प्रकृती योनिः कारणं सर्वभूतानाम्, अतः अहं कृत्स्नस्य समस्तस्य जगतः प्रभवः उत्पत्तिः प्रलयः विनाशः तथा। प्रकृतिद्वयद्वारेण अहं सर्वज्ञः ईश्वरः जगतः कारणमित्यर्थः ॥ ६ ॥

### Transliteration

*Etad-yonīni ete parāpare kṣetra-kṣetrajña-lakṣaṇe prakṛtī yoniḥ yeṣāṁ bhūtānāṁ tāni etad-yonīni, bhūtāni sarvāṇi iti evam upadhāraya jānīhi. Yasmāt mama prakṛtī yoniḥ kāraṇaṁ sarva-bhūtānām, ataḥ ahaṁ kṛtsnasya samastasya jagataḥ prabhavaḥ utpattiḥ pralayaḥ vināśaḥ tathā.

### Translation

"These two Prakritis—the superior and the inferior, characterized as the field (kṣetra) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña)—are the wombs (sources) of all beings whose origin is these; thus, understand that all beings have this as their origin. Since My Prakritis are the cause of all beings, therefore, I am the origin (creation) and dissolution (destruction) of the entire universe. Through the instrumentality of these two Prakritis, I, the omniscient Lord, am the cause of the universe—that is the meaning."

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Idealism**:

   - The phenomenal world (the universe) is a manifestation of the noumenal reality (the Divine).

   - The two Prakritis represent the categories through which the noumenal manifests in the phenomenal realm.

2. **Unity of Apperception**:

   - The Divine as the ultimate source of both subject (consciousness) and object (material world) ensures the unity necessary for experience.

3. **Causality**:

   - The Lord as the origin and dissolution reflects the transcendental cause that makes the existence of phenomena possible.

### Fichtean Development

1. **The Absolute Ego**:

   - The Divine represents the absolute 'I' from which both the self and the not-self arise.

   - The material and spiritual natures are the posited opposites required for the self's realization.

2. **Dialectical Process**:

   - **Thesis**: The self posits the non-self (material nature).

   - **Antithesis**: Recognition of the self in the other (spiritual nature).

   - **Synthesis**: Unity of self and not-self through the Divine, acknowledging the source of both.

3. **Moral Implications**:

   - Understanding the Divine as the source fosters ethical action aligned with the universal will.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Absolute Spirit**:

   - The universe is the self-manifestation of the Absolute Spirit (the Divine).

   - The process of creation and dissolution is the dialectical unfolding of the Spirit realizing itself.

2. **Dialectical Movement**:

   - **Being**: The initial state of the Divine.

   - **Nothing**: The dissolution back into the Divine.

   - **Becoming**: The continuous cycle of creation and dissolution.

3. **Unity in Diversity**:

   - The multiplicity of beings arises from and returns to the One, reflecting the Hegelian notion of the identity of identity and difference.

## Conclusion

In this verse, the Lord encapsulates the totality of existence by declaring Himself as both the origin and dissolution of the universe. All beings arise from His twofold Prakriti—the material and the spiritual. The material nature provides the substance, while the spiritual nature imparts consciousness.

This profound teaching emphasizes the non-dual reality where the Divine is both immanent and transcendent, encompassing all aspects of creation. By understanding this, one gains insight into the unity underlying the apparent diversity of the world.

The German Idealist perspectives enrich this understanding by offering frameworks that parallel the concepts presented. Kant's transcendental idealism, Fichte's self-positing ego, and Hegel's dialectical process all resonate with the idea of the Divine as the ultimate source and reality.

## Next Steps

- **Deepen Understanding**:

  - Reflect on the implications of the Divine being both the material and efficient cause.

  - Contemplate the nature of the self in relation to the higher Prakriti.

- **Proceed to Verse 7**:

  - The next verse will further elaborate on the Lord's unparalleled position and the inseparability of all beings from Him.

- **Philosophical Inquiry**:

  - Explore how these teachings align with or challenge other philosophical systems.

  - Consider the practical applications of this knowledge in one's spiritual practice.
