## Commentary (Bhāṣyam)

### Sanskrit

मनुष्याणां मध्ये सहस्रेषु अनेकेषु कश्चित् यतति प्रयत्नं करोति सिद्धये सिद्ध्यर्थम् । तेषां यततामपि सिद्धानाम्, सिद्धा एव हि ते ये मोक्षाय यतन्ते, तेषां कश्चित् एव हि मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः यथावत् ॥ ३ ॥

### Transliteration

*Manuṣyāṇāṁ madhye sahasreṣu anekeṣu kaścit yatati prayatnaṁ karoti siddhaye siddhy-artham. Teṣāṁ yatatām api siddhānām, siddhā eva hi te ye mokṣāya yatante, teṣāṁ kaścid eva hi māṁ vetti tattvataḥ yathāvat. || 3 ||

### Translation

"Among thousands of men, one person among many makes an effort for perfection. Even among those striving seekers who are perfected—for only they strive for liberation—scarcely one knows Me in truth, as I am."

### Structural Elements

- **Argumentative Structure**: The verse establishes a hierarchy of spiritual endeavor, underscoring the scarcity of true knowledge of the Divine even among dedicated seekers.

- **Logical Progression**:
  1. **General Population**: Among thousands, few strive for perfection.
  2. **Among Seekers**: Even among those striving, few achieve perfection.
  3. **Among the Perfected**: Even among the perfected, only a rare individual knows the Supreme truly.

- **Technical Relationships**:
  - **Effort and Attainment**: The progression from effort (*yatati*) to perfection (*siddhi*), and finally to true knowledge (*tattvataḥ*).
  - **Rarity at Each Stage**: Highlights the diminishing numbers at each successive stage of spiritual advancement.

### Textual Integration

- **Cross-References**:
  - **Bhagavad Gita 7.26**: The Lord knows all beings, but they do not know Him.

- **Term Networks**:
  - **Manuṣya (Human)** ↔ **Yatati (Strives)** ↔ **Siddhi (Perfection)** ↔ **Vettti Tattvataḥ (Knows in Truth)**

## German Idealist Analysis

### Kantian Framework

1. **Transcendental Structure**:
   - **Noumenal vs. Phenomenal**: Knowing the Supreme as He is (*tattvataḥ*) corresponds to grasping the noumenal reality, which Kant posits is inaccessible to most.
   - **Limits of Reason**: Human cognition has limitations; only through transcendental efforts can one approach true understanding.

2. **Critical Method**:
   - Investigates the faculties that enable or hinder true knowledge of the Absolute.
   - Suggests that while many can strive, the epistemological barriers prevent most from attaining true knowledge.

3. **Systematic Unity**:
   - The progression reflects the critical examination of knowledge, where only through rigorous self-examination can one approach the truth.

### Fichtean Development

1. **Self-Positing**:
   - The self must actively strive (*yatati*) towards perfection, asserting itself in the process of seeking the Absolute.
   - The rare individual who knows the Supreme has fully realized the self's potential through active engagement.

2. **Dialectical Movement**:
   - **Thesis**: The common state of humanity.
   - **Antithesis**: The striving towards perfection.
   - **Synthesis**: The attainment of true knowledge, which unifies the self with the Absolute.

3. **Synthetic Unity**:
   - The individual self transcends personal limitations, integrating with the universal Self.
   - This unity is achieved through conscious effort and self-realization.

### Hegelian Integration

1. **Systematic Process**:
   - The verse illustrates the dialectical process of Spirit realizing itself through individual selves.
   - The progression from the general to the particular mirrors Hegel's unfolding of the Absolute.

2. **Concrete Universality**:
   - The individual's realization of the Supreme is a manifestation of the universal truth.
   - Each individual's journey contributes to the self-realization of the Absolute Spirit.

3. **Absolute Method**:
   - The process of knowing the Supreme in truth involves overcoming contradictions and limitations.
   - The rare attainment of true knowledge reflects the culmination of the dialectical process.

## Conclusion

This verse emphasizes the profound rarity of attaining true knowledge of the Supreme Lord. While many may live, few strive for spiritual perfection; among those, even fewer achieve it; and among the perfected, scarcely one truly knows the Lord as He is.

The progression underscores the importance of diligent effort and the exceptional nature of true spiritual realization. It serves as both a humbling reminder of the challenges inherent in the spiritual path and an inspiration to strive earnestly for the highest knowledge.
