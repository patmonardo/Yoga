# Chapter 7: The Science of the Absolute

## Verse 23

### Introduction

In the previous verses, Lord Krishna explained how individuals driven by various desires worship different deities, and how He strengthens their faith and grants their wishes—even though these results are temporary. Now, He emphasizes the transient nature of such pursuits and contrasts them with the eternal outcome of devotion to Him. This verse serves as a compassionate reminder of the impermanence of material gains and the enduring value of seeking the Supreme.

### Sanskrit

**यस्मात् अन्तवत् साधनव्यापारा अविवेकिनः कामिनश्च ते, अतः —**

**अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां
तद् भवत्यल्पमेधसाम् ।
देवान् देवयजो यान्ति
मद्भक्ता यान्ति मामपि ॥ २३ ॥**

### Transliteration

**Yasmāt antavat sādhana-vyāpārā avivekinaḥ kāminaś ca te, ataḥ —**

**Antavattu phalaṁ teṣāṁ
tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām |
Devān deva-yajo yānti
mad-bhaktā yānti mām api || 23 ||**

### Translation

"Those whose minds are distorted by desires and who lack discernment—such people, their efforts lead to limited results:

**Indeed, the fruits of those people are finite;
They belong to people of small understanding.
The worshipers of the gods go to the gods,
But My devotees come to Me.**"

### Commentary

**Temporary Fruits and Limited Understanding**

- **Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavati alpa-medhasām**: The results obtained by those who worship other deities are temporary and finite. These individuals are described as **alpa-medhasām**, meaning "people of small intelligence" or limited understanding. They focus on transient desires without realizing the eternal nature of the Supreme.

**Destinations Based on Worship**

- **Devān deva-yajo yānti**: Those who worship the demigods attain the realms of those gods. Their devotion, being directed toward finite entities, yields finite outcomes.

- **Mad-bhaktā yānti mām api**: In contrast, My devotees, who worship Me with unwavering devotion, attain Me—the eternal and infinite Supreme Being.

**Lord Krishna's Compassion**

- Despite the similar effort (**sādhana-vyāpāra**) required in worship, Lord Krishna expresses compassion for those who do not seek Him for eternal results. He acknowledges that they undergo the same practices but forgo the infinite benefits by not directing their devotion toward Him.

#### Structural Elements

- **Emphasis on Discernment**: Highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of reality and directing devotion accordingly.

- **Universal Law of Worship**: One attains the realm of the entity they worship; thus, worshiping the Supreme leads to the supreme destination.

### Textual Integration

- **Connection to Previous Verses**: Builds upon the theme of individuals driven by desires worshiping other deities and the Lord facilitating their faith and granting their desires.

- **Philosophical Implications**:

  - **Law of Karma and Rebirth**: Attaining the realms of demigods is temporary; once the merit is exhausted, one returns to the cycle of birth and death.

### German Idealist Analysis

#### Kantian Framework

1. **Phenomenal vs. Noumenal Reality**: Worshiping finite deities and seeking material gains corresponds to the phenomenal world of appearances, while devotion to the Supreme represents pursuit of the noumenal reality.

2. **Moral Imperative and Highest Good**: Acting out of transient desires does not align with the moral law. True moral action seeks the highest good—the Supreme Being.

3. **Limited Reasoning**: Those of limited understanding (alpa-medhasām) fail to use reason to discern the ultimate truth.

#### Fichtean Development

1. **Ego and Absolute Ego**: Worshiping finite entities reflects identification with the limited ego. Realizing the Absolute Ego (the Divine Self) requires transcending personal desires.

2. **Moral Development**: The journey from seeking material gains to pursuing the Absolute represents moral and spiritual evolution.

#### Hegelian Integration

1. **Dialectical Progression**:

   - **Thesis**: Desire-driven worship of finite deities.

   - **Antithesis**: Recognition of the impermanence of such worship.

   - **Synthesis**: Devotion to the Absolute, leading to liberation.

2. **Absolute Spirit**: The individual's progression reflects the unfolding of the Absolute Spirit realizing itself through human consciousness.

### Conclusion

Verse 23 serves as a pivotal reminder of the impermanence of material desires and the limited outcomes of worshiping finite deities. Lord Krishna compassionately points out that while people may engage in worship with great effort, if their focus is on temporary gains, they miss the opportunity for eternal fulfillment. He encourages seekers to direct their devotion toward Him, the Supreme Being, to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

This teaching underscores the importance of discernment in spiritual practice. By recognizing the transient nature of material pursuits and the enduring value of seeking the Divine, individuals can align their efforts with the ultimate goal of self-realization and union with the Supreme.
