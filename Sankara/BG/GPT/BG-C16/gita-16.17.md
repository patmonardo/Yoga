एतेऽसौ आत्मसम्भाविताः स्तब्धाः धनमानमदान्विताः ।
यजन्ते नामयज्ञैः, तेषां दम्भेनाविधिपूर्वकम् ।
अयं दृष्टिकोणः अहंभवन्ति असत्यम्, न तु धर्मार्थम् ।

ata ete lōke aśucivratāḥ santaḥ, dharma-dhvajitayā na pravartante ॥ 17 ॥
```

#### Translation
```markdown
### Translation
Śaṅkara explains that these individuals are self-satisfied (*ātmasambhāvitāḥ*), proud (*stabdhāḥ*), and driven by wealth and pride (*dhanamānamadānvitāḥ*). They perform rituals merely in name (*nāmayajnaste*), with arrogance and contrary to proper procedures (*dambhenaāvidhipūrvakam*). This perspective is false (*asatyaṁ*) and not for righteous purposes (*dharmārtham*). Those engaged in such actions are intertwined with unethical deeds (*parasparasamyutam*) and perform rituals improperly (*karmā vidhipūrvakam*). Therefore, these impure vow-makers (*aśucivratāḥ*) do not engage in actions guided by righteousness (*dharmadhvajitayā na pravartante*), leading to moral corruption in society. ॥ 17 ॥

## Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Ground in 1804 Science of Knowing**:
  - **Empiricism**: Observe the practical impact of distinguishing between divine and demoniac qualities on an individual's behavior and spiritual progress. For example, individuals who perform rituals only in name (*nāmayajnaste*) with arrogance disrupt societal harmony and hinder their own spiritual growth.
  - **Rationalism**: Analyze the logical connections between demoniac qualities and their role in obstructing personal and spiritual growth. Understanding how self-satisfaction (*ātmasambhāvitāḥ*) and pride (*stabdhā*) lead to superficial rituals can rationalize the importance of genuine devotion and humility for ethical conduct.

- **Track Systematic Development**:
  - Examine the progression from recognizing demoniac traits (e.g., self-satisfaction, pride) to understanding their consequences (e.g., unethical rituals, societal corruption).
  - Investigate how the superficial performance of rituals driven by arrogance undermines the true purpose of spiritual practices, leading to moral and spiritual degradation.

- **Include Buddhist/Yogic Connections**:
  - **Self-Satisfaction (*ātmasambhāvitāḥ*)**: Compare with Buddhist concepts of *anatta* (non-self) and Yogic *ahamkara* (ego), which hinder self-realization and spiritual progress.
  - **Pride (*stabdhā*)**: Relate to Buddhist *māna* (pride) and Yogic *ahamkara* (ego), emphasizing the need to overcome pride for humility and ethical living.
  - **Superficial Rituals (*nāmayajnaste*)**: Align with Buddhist critiques of empty rituals and Yogic emphasis on sincere practice, highlighting the importance of genuine devotion over mere formality.
  - **Arrogance and Improper Procedures (*dambhenaāvidhipūrvakam*)**: Connect with Buddhist and Yogic teachings on right conduct and proper methods, stressing the significance of ethical execution of spiritual practices.

- **Maintain Non-Dual Framework**:
  - Emphasize the non-dualistic approach where demoniac qualities distort alignment with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
  - Highlight how overcoming these negative traits aligns the individual with universal harmony and spiritual liberation, consistent with Advaita Vedanta's non-dual philosophy.

- **Use Sanskrit Transliteration**:
  - Ensure accurate and consistent transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., *ātmasambhāvitāḥ*, *stabdhā*, *nāmayajnaste*) to preserve their original meanings and facilitate cross-referencing with other philosophical texts.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Self-Satisfaction (*ātmasambhāvitāḥ*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Mirrors *anatta* (non-self), where individuals mistakenly identify with a permanent self, obstructing enlightenment.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Corresponds to *ahamkara* (ego), which fosters a sense of individual identity that hinders unity with the divine.

  - **Pride (*stabdhā*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Reflects *māna* (pride), fostering ego-centric behavior that obstructs enlightenment.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Aligns with *ahamkara* (ego), emphasizing the need to overcome pride for self-realization and ethical living.

  - **Superficial Rituals (*nāmayajnaste*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Critiques empty rituals that lack genuine devotion, aligning with the emphasis on mindful and ethical actions.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Advocates for sincere practice over mere formality, stressing the importance of intention in rituals.

  - **Arrogance and Improper Procedures (*dambhenaāvidhipūrvakam*)**:
    - **Buddhist Connection**: Emphasizes right conduct and proper methods, discouraging arrogant and unethical practices.
    - **Yogic Connection**: Highlights the significance of *samyama* (discipline) and *sadhana* (spiritual practice) conducted with humility and proper methods.

- **Philosophical Synergy**:
  - Both Buddhist and Yogic traditions emphasize the elimination of negative traits like ego (*ahamkara*), pride (*māna*), and superficial practices as essential for achieving ethical purity and spiritual liberation.
  - The reduction of these negative traits aligns with paths advocating for selflessness, humility, and the acquisition of true knowledge, similar to Advaita Vedanta’s emphasis on overcoming demoniac qualities.

- **Terminological Alignment**:
  - Standardize terms across traditions to highlight shared philosophical foundations, such as equating *kāma* (desire) with Buddhist *taṇhā* and Yogic *kāma*.
  - Use consistent transliteration and definitions to facilitate comparative studies and deeper philosophical insights.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedanta Perspective**:
  - Śaṅkara’s interpretation underscores the non-dual nature of existence, where demoniac qualities like self-satisfaction (*ātmasambhāvitāḥ*), pride (*stabdhā*), superficial rituals (*nāmayajnaste*), and arrogance (*dambhenaāvidhipūrvakam*) are seen as obstacles to realizing the oneness of the individual self (*Atman*) with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*).
  - Overcoming these demoniac qualities purifies the mind, aligning individual actions with universal principles, facilitating the realization of non-duality.

- **Integration with Trans-Idealist Thought**:
  - The non-dual framework bridges technical analysis with philosophical depth, allowing for a holistic understanding of how demoniac qualities obstruct spiritual progress.
  - Demonstrates how disciplined action and inner purification are essential for transcending dualistic notions of self and other, leading to non-dual realization.

- **Unity of Action and Liberation**:
  - Actions performed without self-satisfaction, pride, and arrogance transcend dualistic notions of self and other, contributing to liberation (*moksha*).
  - The synthesis of overcoming these demoniac qualities exemplifies the non-dual path where individual actions harmonize with universal order, fostering spiritual freedom.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**:
  - Integrate insights from the Bhagavad Gītā, Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya, and Buddhist-Abhidharma perspectives to present a comprehensive view of how demoniac qualities obstruct liberation.
  - Highlight the interconnectedness of ethical virtues (*daivī sampad*) and the elimination of negative traits (*āsurī sampad*) in achieving self-realization and harmony with the universe.

- **Systematic Development**:
  - Progress from the enumeration of demoniac qualities to their philosophical implications, demonstrating how each quality contributes to spiritual and moral degradation.
  - Show the transition from recognizing negative traits to understanding their impact on one's spiritual journey and the necessity of overcoming them.

- **Meaningful Synthesis**:
  - Highlight the convergence of Hindu and Buddhist philosophies in promoting the elimination of negative traits such as self-satisfaction, pride, superficial rituals, and arrogance.
  - Emphasize how integrated practices from both traditions foster ethical conduct, mental purification, and selfless action, leading to a non-dual understanding of existence and ultimate liberation.
  - Illustrate the practical application of overcoming these demoniac qualities in daily life, contributing to personal growth and societal well-being.
