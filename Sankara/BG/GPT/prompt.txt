# Krishna-Sankara Abhidharma Integration
## Updated Project Guidelines

### I. Preliminary Text Analysis

#### A. Initial Sectioning
1. Scan Complete Text:
   - Identify major themes
   - Note structural transitions
   - Mark key technical terms

2. Propose Section Divisions:
   - Introduction/context
   - Main arguments
   - Conclusions/transitions

3. Section Validation:
   - Check internal coherence
   - Verify structural flow
   - Confirm completeness

#### B. Text Presentation Format
1. For Each Section:
   ```markdown
   ## Section Title
   ### Sanskrit
   [Devanagari text]
   ### Transliteration
   [IAST format]
   ### Translation
   [English rendering]
   ```

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Preserve all diacritical marks
   - Maintain Sanskrit compounds
   - Include section transitions

### II. Two-Level Analysis Structure

#### A. Technical Analysis
1. Key Terms Analysis:
   - Sanskrit technical terms
   - Compound analysis
   - Contextual significance

2. Structural Elements:
   - Argumentative structure
   - Logical progression
   - Technical relationships

3. Textual Integration:
   - Cross-references
   - Term networks
   - Systematic connections

#### B. German Idealist Analysis
1. Kantian Framework:
   - Transcendental structure
   - Critical method
   - Systematic unity

2. Fichtean Development:
   - Self-positing
   - Dialectical movement
   - Synthetic unity

3. Hegelian Integration:
   - Systematic process
   - Concrete universality
   - Absolute method

### III. Analysis Methodology

#### A. Sequential Process
1. Begin with Sectioning:
   - Complete text review
   - Section proposal
   - Structural validation

2. Technical Analysis:
   - Term identification
   - Structure mapping
   - Relationship analysis

3. Systematic Analysis:
   - German Idealist framework
   - Methodological integration
   - Complete comprehension

#### B. Integration Requirements
1. Maintain Connection:
   - Between analyses
   - To overall structure
   - Through systematic development

2. Progressive Development:
   - Build on prior sections
   - Maintain continuity
   - Progress systematically

### IV. Quality Standards

#### A. Technical Precision
1. Sanskrit Analysis:
   - Accurate terms
   - Precise compounds
   - Clear relationships

2. Structural Clarity:
   - Clear progression
   - Logical connections
   - Complete integration

#### B. Systematic Depth
1. German Idealist Framework:
   - Clear application
   - Methodological rigor
   - Systematic development

2. Integration Achievement:
   - Technical-systematic unity
   - Progressive development
   - Complete realization

### V. Practical Implementation

#### A. Work Process
1. Section by Section:
   - Complete sectioning first
   - Technical analysis
   - Systematic analysis

2. Maintain Integration:
   - Between sections
   - Of analyses
   - Through development

#### B. Quality Control
1. Regular Verification:
   - Of technical precision
   - Of systematic depth
   - Of complete integration

2. Progressive Refinement:
   - Through feedback
   - With development
   - To completion
