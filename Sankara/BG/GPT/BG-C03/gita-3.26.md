### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing actions without causing confusion aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an embodiment of the categorical imperative, where actions are performed according to maxims that can be universally applied. By acting in unity with the Supreme, the wise uphold universal moral laws, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive for the wise to perform all actions in unity with the Supreme resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By setting an exemplary standard, the wise contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that wise action, performed in unity with the Supreme, harmonizes duty with spiritual principles. This synthesis ensures that actions are not contradictory to spiritual pursuits but complement them, leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Role of the Wise:**
   - The wise perform all actions in unity with the Supreme, preventing confusion among the ignorant caused by intellectual distinctions.

2. **Prevention of Confusion:**
   - By acting harmoniously with the Supreme, the wise set a clear and consistent example, guiding the ignorant towards righteous conduct.

3. **Integration of Duty and Knowledge:**
   - Emphasizes that selfless action, aligned with divine principles, ensures both societal harmony and personal spiritual growth.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The teachings align with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Unified Action:**
  - Performing actions in unity with the Supreme ensures that duties are fulfilled without causing moral or intellectual confusion.

- **Modeling Righteous Behavior:**
  - The wise, through their selfless actions, serve as role models, fostering ethical behavior and societal harmony.

- **Maintaining Cosmic Order:**
  - Selfless action contributes to the maintenance of cosmic and societal order, aligning individual duties with universal principles.

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Harmonizes ethical duty with spiritual principles, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to life that fosters both material prosperity and spiritual liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
