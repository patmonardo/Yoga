यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानवः ।

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“He who is content solely with himself and is satisfied in himself, being alone content, O man, has no duties to perform.” (Gītā 3.17)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that those who are solely content with themselves and indulge in self-satisfaction live impure and fruitless lives. Such individuals neglect their prescribed duties (karma) and engage only in self-indulgent pleasures, leading to moral corruption and spiritual stagnation. By being absorbed in themselves and ignoring their responsibilities, they fail to contribute to the cosmic and societal order, thereby not attaining the ultimate goal of liberation (mokṣa). Thus, Śrī Bhagavān emphasizes the importance of performing one's duties selflessly to achieve both material prosperity and spiritual growth.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing duties without attachment aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. By performing one's duties selflessly, individuals adhere to a universal moral law, ensuring that their actions are ethically consistent and devoid of selfish motives. Kant would argue that such duty-bound actions are essential for maintaining moral integrity and achieving a morally upright life, resonating with Śaṅkara’s teachings on the importance of performing yajña for ultimate well-being and liberation.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform yajña resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. This balance ensures that self-realization involves both inward knowledge and outward action, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (yajña) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Self-Contentment vs. Duty:**
   - The verse criticizes individuals who are solely content with themselves and neglect their duties, leading to a morally and spiritually impure life.

2. **Importance of Yajña and Duty:**
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes the necessity of performing yajña (sacrifice) and fulfilling one's duties selflessly to maintain cosmic and societal order, ensuring both material prosperity and spiritual growth.

3. **Philosophical Alignment:**
   - The analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in duties, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating action with spiritual knowledge.

4. **Consequences of Neglecting Duty:**
   - Neglecting duties in favor of self-indulgence results in moral corruption, spiritual stagnation, and failure to attain mokṣa (liberation).

**Concluding Insights:**

Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**yajña**) and detached engagement. By performing one's duties without attachment to the results, individuals contribute to the maintenance of cosmic and societal order while simultaneously progressing on their spiritual journey. This balanced approach ensures logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings, promoting both personal well-being and universal harmony.
