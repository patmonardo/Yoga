## Text Presentation

### Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)

**Verse (Bhagavad Gītā 3.9)**
```
यच्च मन्यसे बन्धार्थत्वात् कर्म न कर्तव्यमिति तदप्यसत् ।
कथम् —
यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः ।
तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ॥ ९ ॥
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
‘यज्ञो वै विष्णुः’ (तै. स. १ । ७ । ४) इति श्रुतेः यज्ञः ईश्वरः, तदर्थं यत् क्रियते तत् यज्ञार्थं कर्म । तस्मात् कर्मणः अन्यत्र अन्येन कर्मणा लोकः अयम् अधिकृतः कर्मकृत् कर्मबन्धनः कर्म बन्धनं यस्य सोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः लोकः, न तु यज्ञार्थात् । अतः तदर्थं यज्ञार्थं कर्म कौन्तेय, मुक्तसङ्गः कर्मफलसङ्गवर्जितः सन् समाचर निर्वर्तय ॥ ९ ॥
```

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“O Kuntheya (Arjuna), you think that action should not be performed merely out of desire for liberation; but then, how? For action performed for the sake of sacrifice (yajña) binds one to karma in this world. Therefore, perform your duty, O son of Kunti, with detachment, free from attachment to the fruits of actions.” (Gītā 3.9)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
The yajña (sacrifice) is Vishnu as per the Śruti, specifically cited from the Taittiriya Samhita (1.7.4), which means that the yajña is the Lord, and whatever is performed is for the sake of yajña. Therefore, in other contexts, the world is established by other actions, leading to karmabandhana (bondage through karma). The bondage of action is determined by karma performed by others, not by yajña. Thus, O Kuntheya (Arjuna), perform actions dedicated to yajña with detachment from attachment to the fruits of actions, thereby being free from attachment.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Technical Analysis

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- **Yajña (यज्ञ):**
  Sacrifice or ritual action performed in accordance with Vedic injunctions. In this context, yajña represents selfless action dedicated to the divine.

- **Viṣṇuḥ (विष्णुः):**
  Vishnu, the preserver aspect of the Hindu trinity, representing the divine authority overseeing yajña.

- **Karmabandhanaḥ (कर्मबन्धनः):**
  Bondage or attachment caused by actions (karma). It refers to being bound by the results and obligations arising from one's deeds.

- **Muktasaṅgaḥ (मुक्तसङ्गः):**
  Free from attachment; detached from the fruits of actions.

- **Karmaphala-sangavarjitaḥ (कर्मफलसङ्गवर्जितः):**
  Renouncing attachment to the fruits of actions.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Identification of Yajña as Divine:**
   - Śrī Bhagavān (Vishnu) is identified as the embodiment of yajña, meaning that all sacrificial actions are inherently divine.

2. **Contrast Between Yajña and Other Actions:**
   - Actions performed for yajña (sacrifice) are distinct from other worldly actions. The former is divinely sanctioned and purposed, while the latter can lead to bondage (karmabandhana).

3. **Logic of Action vs. Inaction:**
   - Arjuna's belief that renouncing action leads to liberation is challenged. Śaṅkara argues that performing duty (karma) without attachment is superior and essential for liberation.

4. **Directive for Detached Action:**
   - Arjuna is instructed to perform his duties with detachment, emphasizing selfless action as the path to liberation.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **Arjuna’s Misconception:**
   - Arjuna believes that renouncing action is necessary for liberation, thinking that all actions lead to bondage.

2. **Śaṅkara’s Clarification:**
   - Śrī Bhagavān clarifies that actions performed as yajña (sacrifice) are divine and do not bind one to karma. Instead, selfless action leads to liberation.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, performing one's duty as yajña, with detachment from the results, is the correct path to liberation.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Śruti:**
  - The Taittiriya Samhita (1.7.4) is cited to establish the divine nature of yajña, aligning Śaṅkara’s interpretation with authoritative Vedic texts.

- **Consistency with Prior Verses:**
  - This explanation aligns with the earlier discussion where Arjuna questions the necessity of action if knowledge is superior, reinforcing that selfless action is integral to spiritual progress.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing duties without attachment aligns with Kantian ethics, which advocate for actions based on duty rather than personal inclination. By dedicating actions to yajña, one adheres to a universal moral law, ensuring that actions are morally consistent and devoid of selfish motives. This reflects Kant’s notion that duty must be performed for its own sake, not for the outcomes it produces.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty as yajña resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. This balance ensures that self-realization involves both inward knowledge and outward action, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary elucidate the necessity of performing one's duties as yajña, emphasizing that such selfless action leads to liberation without causing bondage. Technically, it establishes that actions performed with the right intention and dedication to the divine do not bind one to karma but instead facilitate spiritual growth and liberation.

Philosophically, the analysis aligns with:

- **Kantian Ethics:**
  Advocates for duty-bound actions based on universal moral principles, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity.

- **Fichtean Self-Striving:**
  Emphasizes the active engagement in duties as essential for self-realization and moral development.

- **Hegelian Dialectical Unity:**
  Integrates action and knowledge into a cohesive spiritual path, resolving potential conflicts through higher synthesis.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
