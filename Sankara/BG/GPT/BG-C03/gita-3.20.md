### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“But those like Janaka and others who have achieved perfection through action alone, you should see as worthy of engaging in the pursuit of gathering the world.” (Gītā 3.20)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that individuals like Janaka, who have attained spiritual perfection solely through selfless action (karma), are exemplary models. These individuals perform their duties diligently without attachment, thereby achieving both material prosperity and spiritual liberation. By observing and emulating such personalities, one understands the importance of performing one's duties selflessly. Śaṅkara emphasizes that engaging in selfless action not only contributes to the welfare of society but also leads to personal spiritual growth and the attainment of mokṣa (liberation). Thus, those who perform their duties with dedication and without attachment are worthy of being followed in the pursuit of worldly and spiritual goals.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing selfless action aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. According to Kant, actions must be performed out of a sense of duty and in accordance with universal moral laws. Śaṅkara reinforces this by highlighting that selfless action leads to both societal welfare and spiritual liberation, reflecting Kant’s notion that duty-bound actions uphold moral integrity and universal ethical standards.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform selfless duty resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By emulating figures like Janaka, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Exemplary Models of Selfless Action:**
   - Individuals like Janaka exemplify how selfless action leads to both societal welfare and spiritual perfection.

2. **Importance of Duty Without Attachment:**
   - Performing one's duties diligently and selflessly ensures the maintenance of cosmic and societal order, while also facilitating personal spiritual growth.

3. **Integration of Material and Spiritual Goals:**
   - Selfless action bridges the gap between material prosperity and spiritual liberation, ensuring a balanced and harmonious life.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The teachings align with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Cosmic Order:**
  - Yajña (selfless action) represents the integration of personal duty with cosmic processes, ensuring that individual actions contribute to the larger order.

- **Emulation of Exemplary Figures:**
  - Observing and emulating individuals like Janaka fosters selfless action and ethical living, promoting both personal and societal well-being.

- **Holistic Approach to Well-being:**
  - Balancing material duties with spiritual aspirations ensures comprehensive well-being and advancement towards mokṣa (liberation).

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - The teachings maintain logical consistency and doctrinal integrity by harmonizing ethical duty with spiritual principles, fostering a unified path to liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
