### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing actions according to Krishna’s well-established duty aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty (dharma) rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an embodiment of the categorical imperative, where actions are performed according to maxims that can be universally applied. By performing one’s duty selflessly, individuals uphold universal moral laws, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity. This resonates with Śaṅkara’s teachings on the importance of duty-bound actions for universal harmony and personal liberation.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty according to Krishna’s teachings resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By performing actions selflessly and adhering to duty, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical responsibility.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the pursuit of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Doctrine of Duty:**
   - Krishna’s well-established teachings provide a definitive framework for performing one’s duties (karma).

2. **Qualities of Action:**
   - Actions performed with faith (śraddhāvantaḥ) and without envy (anasūyanto) are essential for spiritual progress and liberation.

3. **Liberation through Selfless Action:**
   - Performing duties selflessly, in alignment with Krishna’s teachings, leads to mokṣa (liberation) by transcending the cycle of karma.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The teachings align with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Cosmic Order:**
  - Performing one’s duties selflessly ensures the maintenance of societal and cosmic harmony, contributing to the greater good.

- **Role of Faith and Selflessness:**
  - Faithful and selfless actions, free from envy, are pivotal in achieving spiritual liberation and sustaining societal order.

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Harmonizes ethical duty with spiritual principles, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to life that fosters both material prosperity and spiritual liberation.

- **Path to Mokṣa:**
  - Emphasizes that true liberation is achieved through disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within Śaṅkara’s exegesis of the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
