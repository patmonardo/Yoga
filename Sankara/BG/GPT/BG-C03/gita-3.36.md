### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
Arjuna said:
"O Krishna, by what cause does this sinful man perform actions, though he does not desire them, like a subject under compulsion by force?"
```

### Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)

Śrī Śaṅkarācārya elucidates that an individual, despite lacking the desire to perform certain actions, engages in them due to the compulsion imposed by their inherent nature (**prakṛti**) and the dominant qualities (**guṇa**) that influence their behavior. Such actions are not undertaken out of personal volition but are driven by the internal forces of passion (**rāga**) and aversion (**dveṣa**), which bind the individual to the cycle of **karma**. Śaṅkara emphasizes that even a knowledgeable person is susceptible to these inherent tendencies, which compel them to act against their better judgment, thereby perpetuating sin and hindering spiritual progress. The root cause lies in the misalignment with one's true self and the dominance of material nature over spiritual wisdom.

3. **Consequences:**
   - Actions are performed not out of personal desire but due to compulsion, leading to sin and hindrance in spiritual progress.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **Observation of Compulsion:**
   - Despite lack of desire, actions are performed under compulsion.

2. **Inquiry into Cause:**
   - Arjuna seeks to understand why an individual acts against their desire.

3. **Identification of Internal Forces:**

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on understanding the compulsion behind actions aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as highlighting the importance of recognizing the moral duty to act rightly, despite internal compulsion. By identifying the underlying reasons for actions, individuals can strive to act out of duty, thereby upholding universal moral laws and ensuring ethical consistency and integrity.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to understand and overcome the compulsion of **prakṛti** resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must strive to transcend inherent tendencies to fulfill societal roles ethically. By overcoming internal compulsion and acting out of duty, individuals contribute to their own self-realization and ethical development, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the contradiction between personal desire and duty is addressed by Śaṅkara’s teaching that individuals should act out of duty despite compulsion from inherent qualities. This synthesis resolves the tension between personal inclination and universal duty, leading to a unified approach to action that harmonizes individual behavior with cosmic order. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s guidance as achieving a higher unity where duty and action are aligned with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Compulsion by Nature:**
   - Individuals perform actions not out of desire but due to internal compulsion from **prakṛti** and **guṇa**.

2. **Impact on Spiritual Progress:**
   - Acting under compulsion perpetuates sin and hinders spiritual growth.

3. **Philosophical Alignment:**
   - Aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-based actions, Fichtean self-striving through ethical engagement, and Hegelian dialectical unity by harmonizing duty with inherent qualities.

4. **Role of Knowledge:**
   - Recognizes the importance of understanding the underlying causes of actions to overcome compulsion and act out of duty.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Understanding Internal Compulsion:**
  - Identifying the role of **prakṛti** and **guṇa** helps in recognizing why individuals act against their desire.

- **Emphasis on Duty:**
  - Encourages performing one's own duty (**svadharma**) aligned with inherent nature, even if imperfectly, rather than attempting another's duty.

- **Path to Liberation:**
  - Overcoming compulsion and acting out of duty leads to spiritual liberation (**mokṣa**), as it transcends the cycle of karma driven by passion and aversion.

- **Philosophical Harmony:**
  - Harmonizes ethical duty with spiritual principles, ensuring a balanced approach to life that fosters both moral integrity and spiritual liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and the realization and overcoming of internal compulsion, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
