### Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)

**Verse (Bhagavad Gītā 3.14)**
```
इतश्च अधिकृतेन कर्म कर्तव्यम् जगच्चक्रप्रवृत्तिहेतुर्हि कर्म । कथमिति उच्यते —

यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ॥ १४ ॥
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
अन्नात् भुक्तात् लोहितरेतःपरिणतात् प्रत्यक्षं भवन्ति जायन्ते भूतानि । पर्जन्यात् वृष्टेः अन्नस्य सम्भवः अन्नसम्भवः । यज्ञात् भवति पर्जन्यः, ‘अग्नौ प्रास्ताहुतिः सम्यगादित्यमुपतिष्ठते । आदित्याज्जायते वृष्टिर्वृष्टेरन्नं ततः प्रजाः’ (मनु. ३ । ७६) इति स्मृतेः । यज्ञः अपूर्वम् । स च यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ऋत्विग्यजमानयोश्च व्यापारः कर्म, तत् समुद्भवः यस्य यज्ञस्य अपूर्वस्य स यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ॥ १४ ॥

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“But how, O Janārdana (Krishna), is it possible? From food are born living beings, from rain arises food, and from sacrifice (yajña) arises rain. Yajña originates from action, and yajña is the origin of karmic actions performed by those who conduct sacrifices according to the seasons. Therefore, yajña is the origin of all karmic actions.” (Gītā 3.14)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that living beings arise from food, which in turn arises from rain, and rain is produced through yajña (sacrifice). According to the Manu Smriti (3.76), “Agni (the fire god) performs proper sacrifices, leading to the production of rain. From rain comes food, and from food, progeny is born.” Yajña is extraordinary and serves as the origin of all karmic actions. The seasonal sacrifices performed by the righteous (ṛtvi-gyajamānayoḥ) are forms of karma, and yajña, being the origin of these actions, is fundamentally the source of all karmic activities.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Technical Analysis

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- **Yajña (यज्ञ):**
  Sacrifice or ritual action performed in accordance with Vedic injunctions. Symbolizes selfless action dedicated to the divine and the maintenance of cosmic order.

- **Prakṛti (प्रकृति):**
  Nature or the material world, including inherent qualities (guṇaiḥ) that drive an individual's actions.

- **Bhavanti (भवन्ति):**
  Are born; denotes the origin or creation of something.

- **Samudbhavaḥ (समुद्भवः):**
  Originated from; indicates the source or cause.

- **Prasaviṣyadhvaṃ (प्रसविष्यध्वम्):**
  To cause to reproduce or facilitate creation.

- **Manu Smriti (मनु स्मृति):**
  Ancient legal text of Hinduism, providing guidelines on various aspects of life and duty.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Causal Chain of Creation:**
   - The verse outlines a causal chain: Action (karma) leads to yajña (sacrifice), yajña leads to rain, rain leads to food, and food leads to living beings.

2. **Origin of Yajña:**
   - Yajña originates from action (karma), establishing that selfless action is fundamental to cosmic and societal order.

3. **Integration with Seasonal Duties:**
   - The verse connects yajña with seasonal sacrifices performed by the righteous, emphasizing the cyclical and ordered nature of these actions.

4. **Scriptural Reference:**
   - Śaṅkara cites Manu Smriti to support the explanation of yajña's role in sustaining life and maintaining cosmic balance.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **From Action to Yajña:**
   - Actions performed without attachment lead to yajña, which is a selfless form of sacrifice dedicated to the divine.

2. **Yajña Facilitates Natural Processes:**
   - Yajña is depicted as the means through which natural processes like rain are produced, which in turn support life by generating food.

3. **Yajña as the Origin of Karmic Actions:**
   - All karmic actions performed through yajña are derived from the initial act of selfless sacrifice, maintaining the continuity of creation and sustenance.

4. **Purpose of Yajña:**
   - The ultimate purpose of yajña is to uphold cosmic order, facilitate natural processes, and ensure the well-being and growth of living beings.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Manu Smriti:**
  - The commentary aligns Śaṅkara’s explanation with authoritative texts like Manu Smriti, reinforcing the Vedic understanding of yajña’s role.

- **Consistency with Previous Verses:**
  - Builds upon earlier teachings where the necessity and superiority of selfless action (karma-yoga) are emphasized, reinforcing the interconnectedness of action and spiritual progress.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing yajña as a form of duty aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. By performing yajña selflessly, one adheres to a universal moral law, ensuring that actions are morally consistent and devoid of selfish motives. This reflects Kant’s notion that duty must be performed for its own sake, not for the outcomes it produces.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform yajña resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. This balance ensures that self-realization involves both inward knowledge and outward action, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (yajña) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary elucidate the essential role of yajña (sacrifice) in maintaining cosmic and societal order. Technically, it establishes that performing selfless actions (karma-yoga) through yajña is fundamental to sustaining life and ensuring growth. Yajña serves as the origin of natural processes like rain and food, which are necessary for the continuation of life and the fulfillment of duties.

Philosophically, the analysis aligns with:

- **Kantian Ethics:**
  Advocates for duty-bound actions based on universal moral principles, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity.

- **Fichtean Self-Striving:**
  Emphasizes the active engagement in duties as essential for self-realization and moral development.

- **Hegelian Dialectical Unity:**
  Integrates action and knowledge into a cohesive spiritual path, resolving potential conflicts through higher synthesis.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Cosmic Order:**
  Yajña represents the integration of personal duty with cosmic processes, ensuring that individual actions contribute to the larger order.

- **Purposeful Selfless Action:**
  Emphasizes that actions must be performed selflessly and with clear intention to align with universal principles and achieve spiritual growth.

- **Cyclical Nature of Creation:**
  Highlights the interconnectedness of action, sacrifice, natural processes, and the sustenance of life, reinforcing the cyclical nature of creation and maintenance.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (yajña) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
