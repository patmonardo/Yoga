### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
"How does He establish an enemy? He establishes them through various similes:
Fire is obscured by smoke, the sun is obscured by dust,
The moon is obscured by clouds—thus He establishes them, O Bharata." (Gītā 3.38)
```

### Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)

Śrī Śaṅkarācārya elucidates that **Vairi** (enemy) is manifested through the influence of **prakṛti** (nature) and the **guṇas** (qualities) that inherently exist within all beings. Just as fire is covered by smoke, the sun by dust, and the moon by clouds, these obstructions symbolize the manifestations of negative emotions and ignorance that conceal the true self. Śaṅkara explains that enemies arise not from an external divine will but from the internal defilements and misalignments of individuals with their own dharma (duty). The similes emphasize how these obstructions (passions, desires, and ignorance) distort perception and lead individuals away from their righteous path, thereby establishing enemies within the societal and cosmic order.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on understanding the internal causes of enmity aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty (**dharma**) rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an embodiment of the **categorical imperative**, where actions are performed according to maxims that can be universally applied without causing harm. By recognizing and addressing internal obstructions (like lust, anger, and ignorance), individuals can perform their duties ethically, upholding universal moral laws and ensuring societal harmony.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive underscores the importance of self-awareness and overcoming inherent tendencies that lead to conflict. By using similes, Krishna illustrates how internal qualities can create obstacles, urging individuals to strive beyond these defilements. This aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action, where the self must actively engage in ethical behavior to shape a harmonious society.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the potential conflict between adhering to divine duty and overcoming internal obstructions is addressed through Krishna’s teachings. The similes serve as a method to illustrate the synthesis where duty (**karma-yoga**) is harmonized with self-mastery over negative emotions. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s guidance as achieving a higher unity where ethical duty and spiritual principles coexist, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Cause of Enmity:**
   - Enemies are established through internal obstructions born from inherent qualities and defilements.

2. **Use of Similes:**
   - Krishna employs analogies of fire obscured by smoke, sun obscured by dust, and moon obscured by clouds to illustrate the formation of enemies.

3. **Impact of Internal Defilements:**
   - Negative emotions and ignorance distort perception and actions, leading to conflict and obstruction.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - Aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty and universal moral laws.
   - Resonates with Fichtean self-striving through ethical engagement.
   - Harmonizes with Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with self-mastery.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Understanding Internal Obstructions:**
  - Recognizing how inherent qualities and negative emotions lead to the establishment of enemies is crucial for overcoming them.

- **Role of Duty:**
  - Performing one’s duty selflessly and ethically helps maintain societal harmony and prevent conflicts.

- **Self-Mastery:**
  - Overcoming internal defilements like lust, anger, and ignorance is essential for spiritual progress and liberation (**mokṣa**).

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Ensures a balanced approach to life by integrating ethical duty with spiritual principles, fostering both personal and universal well-being.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and the mastery over inherent emotions and qualities, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
