### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“O Arjuna, the gods grant you desired enjoyments such as women, cattle, and other pleasures, which are produced by yajña (sacrifice).
But he who consumes these benefits simply to gratify his desires and indulges himself in such pleasures is considered impure and devoid of true purpose.” (Gītā 3.12)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that the gods bestow desired enjoyments (iṣṭānbhogān) such as women, cattle, and other pleasures, which are produced through yajña (sacrificial rituals). However, those who consume these benefits merely to satisfy their personal desires and indulge themselves in such pleasures are deemed impure (taskara) and devoid of true purpose (mokṣa). These individuals, by neglecting the true intent of yajña and engaging solely in self-indulgent behavior, become corrupt and lose the essence of their spiritual duties.

  - Builds upon the earlier discussion of the importance of performing duty (karma) without attachment, reinforcing that the purpose of actions should align with spiritual and societal well-being.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s viewpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing yajña with the right intention aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. By performing yajña selflessly, one adheres to a universal moral law, ensuring that actions are morally consistent and devoid of selfish motives. This reflects Kant’s notion that duty must be performed for its own sake, not for the outcomes it produces.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform yajña resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. This balance ensures that self-realization involves both inward knowledge and outward action, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (yajña) is not contradictory to the path of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary emphasize the essential role of yajña (sacrifice) in maintaining societal order and facilitating both material prosperity and spiritual advancement. Technically, it establishes that performing prescribed duties through yajña is not only beneficial but necessary for the sustenance and expansion of life. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through both knowledge and action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating action and knowledge into a cohesive spiritual path.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Desire:**
  - Yajña serves as a means to fulfill both societal duties and personal desires, ensuring that actions are purposeful and aligned with cosmic order.

- **Purposeful Rituals:**
  - Emphasizes the importance of intention in performing rituals, ensuring that actions contribute to both personal and collective well-being.

- **Moral and Spiritual Harmony:**
  - Balances the performance of duties with spiritual objectives, maintaining harmony between practical responsibilities and spiritual growth.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (yajña) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
