### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
"The Blessed Lord said: 'O best of the Bharatas, just as the ignorant work with attachment to results, so the wise work without attachment, desiring the welfare of the world.'” (Gītā 3.25)
```

### Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)

Śrī Bhagavān explains that individuals can be classified based on their approach to action (**karma**). The **ignorant** (avidvānsaḥ) perform actions with a strong attachment to the fruits of their labor, driven by personal desires and selfish motives. In contrast, the **wise** (saktāḥ) engage in actions without any attachment to the results, motivated solely by the intention to promote the welfare of the world (**lokasaṅgrahaḥ**). Śaṅkara elucidates that selfless action aligns with the principles of dharma (righteousness) and contributes to the maintenance of societal and cosmic order. By acting without attachment, the wise transcend the limitations of ego and selfishness, thereby attaining spiritual growth and contributing positively to the world.

3. **Emphasis on Welfare:**

- **Alignment with Vedic and Upaniṣadic Teachings:**
  - Aligns with Vedic principles advocating for yajña (sacrifice) and dharma (duty) as means to sustain cosmic and societal order. Upaniṣadic teachings further connect action with spiritual liberation (mokṣa) through selfless duty.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing actions without attachment aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. According to Kant, actions must be performed out of a sense of duty and in accordance with universal moral laws (categorical imperative). Śaṅkara reinforces this by highlighting that selfless action not only upholds moral integrity but also sets a universal standard for ethical behavior, ensuring that actions are ethically consistent and devoid of selfish motives.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty without attachment resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By performing actions selflessly, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the pursuit of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Dual Approaches to Action:**
   - The verse delineates two types of actions based on attachment: those driven by ignorance and selfish desires, and those motivated by selfless intent for societal welfare.

2. **Influence and Imitation:**
   - Actions of the ignorant lead to negative consequences, while actions of the wise set positive standards that others emulate, ensuring societal and cosmic harmony.

3. **Importance of Selfless Duty:**
   - Performing duties without attachment aligns personal actions with universal principles, fostering both material prosperity and spiritual growth.

4. **Philosophical Alignment:**
   - The teachings align with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Cosmic Order:**
  - Performing one's duties selflessly ensures the maintenance of societal and cosmic harmony, contributing to the greater good.

- **Role of Exemplary Individuals:**
  - Exemplary actions by virtuous individuals set a standard for others to follow, fostering ethical behavior and mutual respect.

- **Moral and Spiritual Responsibility:**
  - Emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duties not just for personal well-being but for the collective welfare of society.

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Harmonizes ethical duty with spiritual principles, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to life that fosters both material prosperity and spiritual liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
