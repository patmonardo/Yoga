```

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
"It is far better to perform one's own duties, though imperfectly, than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling one's own duty, even imperfectly, one does not incur sin; but by attempting to perform another's duty, one is liable to incur sin." (Gītā 3.35)
```

### Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)

Śrī Śaṅkarācārya elucidates that each individual is bound by their own **svadharma** (personal duty) based on their inherent nature and societal position. Performing one's own duties, even if not executed perfectly, is preferable because it aligns with one's intrinsic qualities and responsibilities. Attempting to undertake another's duties, which are not suited to one's nature, can lead to failure and the accumulation of sin. Śaṅkara emphasizes that adhering to one's own **svadharma** ensures spiritual progress and maintains societal harmony, whereas neglecting it to perform another's duty disrupts both personal and cosmic order.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing actions according to one's inherent duty aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty (**dharma**) rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an embodiment of the **categorical imperative**, where actions are performed according to maxims that can be universally applied. By understanding and aligning one’s duties with one’s nature, individuals uphold universal moral laws, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity. This resonates with Śaṅkara’s teachings on the importance of duty-bound actions for universal harmony and personal liberation.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty according to one’s inherent nature resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By performing actions selflessly and adhering to duty aligned with one’s nature, individuals contribute to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical responsibility.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the potential conflict between enforcing universal duties and respecting individual nature is addressed by Śaṅkara’s teaching that individuals should perform their duties in accordance with their inherent nature. This synthesis ensures that actions are harmonious with both individual dispositions and universal principles, leading to spiritual liberation and societal harmony. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s guidance as achieving a higher unity where duty is fulfilled without causing unnecessary disruption, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Doctrine of Duty:**
   - Krishna’s well-established teachings provide a definitive framework for performing one’s duties (**karma**).

2. **Qualities of Action:**
   - Actions performed with faith (**śraddhāvantaḥ**) and without envy (**anasūyanto**) are essential for spiritual progress and liberation.

3. **Liberation through Selfless Action:**
   - Performing duties selflessly, in alignment with Krishna’s teachings, leads to **mokṣa** (liberation) by transcending the cycle of karma.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The teachings align with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Integration of Duty and Cosmic Order:**
  - Performing one’s duties selflessly ensures the maintenance of societal and cosmic harmony, contributing to the greater good.

- **Role of Faith and Selflessness:**
  - Faithful and selfless actions, free from envy, are pivotal in achieving spiritual liberation and sustaining societal order.

- **Philosophical Consistency:**
  - Harmonizes ethical duty with spiritual principles, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to life that fosters both material prosperity and spiritual liberation.

- **Path to Mokṣa:**
  - Emphasizes that true liberation is achieved through disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within Śaṅkara’s exegesis of the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and adherence to one's own duty, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
