## Text Presentation

### Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)

**Verse (Bhagavad Gītā 3.2)**
किञ्च—
व्यामिश्रेणेव वाक्येन बुद्धिं मोहयसीव मे ।
तदेकं वद निश्चित्य येन श्रेयोऽहमाप्नुयाम् ॥ २ ॥

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
व्यामिश्रेणेव, यद्यपि विविक्ताभिधायी भगवान् , तथापि मम मन्दबुद्धेः व्यामिश्रमिव भगवद्वाक्यं प्रतिभाति । तेन मम बुद्धिं मोहयसि इव, मम बुद्धिव्यामोहापनयाय हि प्रवृत्तः त्वं तु कथं मोहयसि ? अतः ब्रवीमि बुद्धिं मोहयसि इव मे मम इति । त्वं तु भिन्नकर्तृकयोः ज्ञानकर्मणोः एकपुरुषानुष्ठानासम्भवं यदि मन्यसे, तत्रैवं सति तत् तयोः एकं बुद्धिं कर्म वा इदमेव अर्जुनस्य योग्यं बुद्धिशक्त्यवस्थानुरूपमिति निश्चित्य वद ब्रूहि, येन ज्ञानेन कर्मणा वा अन्यतरेण श्रेयः अहम् आप्नुयां प्राप्नुयाम् ; इति यदुक्तं तदपि नोपपद्यते ॥
यदि हि कर्मनिष्ठायां गुणभूतमपि ज्ञानं भगवता उक्तं स्यात् , तत् कथं तयोः ‘एकं वद’ इति एकविषयैव अर्जुनस्य शुश्रूषा स्यात् । न हि भगवता पूर्वमुक्तम् ‘अन्यतरदेव ज्ञानकर्मणोः वक्ष्यामि, नैव द्वयम्’ इति, येन उभयप्राप्त्यसम्भवम् आत्मनो मन्यमानः एकमेव प्रार्थयेत् ॥ २ ॥

### Translation (English)

**Verse**
**Arjuna said:**
“O Janārdana (Krishna), if You consider understanding (buddhi) to be superior to action (karma), then why do You engage me in this terrible activity, O Keśava?” (Gītā 3.2)

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
Śaṅkara explains: Although the Lord, Krishna, has declared understanding (buddhi) to be superior to action through a convoluted statement, my dull intellect perceives Your words as confusing as a tangled knot. By such means, You seem to be misleading my understanding. How, then, can You, who are intent on confusing my intellect, make me question Your directive? Therefore, I say, “You are indeed confusing my understanding.” If You believe that a single individual should undertake both knowledge and action with conflicting duties, then it logically follows that for Arjuna, whose suitable mental disposition aligns with only one path (knowledge over action), it becomes necessary to assert that knowledge is superior to action. However, even this assertion does not hold up logically.

If, indeed, the Lord had declared that knowledge is inherently superior even when combined with action, how then could Arjuna’s singular focus on one subject (“Speak one thing”) make sense? The Lord had not previously stated, “I will speak of knowledge and action separately, not both together,” which would lead a person to desire only one path for attaining both. Therefore, such a statement does not allow for the combination of knowledge and action, rendering Arjuna’s question “If it is superior” invalid.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Technical Analysis

**Key Terms & Concepts:**

- **Buddhi (बुद्धि):** Refers to intellect or understanding, especially in the spiritual context as discriminative knowledge.

- **Karma (कर्म):** Action, particularly duty-bound action performed without attachment to results, as prescribed by Dharma.

- **Vyāmiśreṇa (व्यामिश्रेण):** Means "by convoluted or mixed words," indicating a complex or confusing manner of expression.

- **Pratyavāya (प्रत्यवाय):** Sin of omission; failing to perform one's prescribed duties.

- **Jñāna-Karma-Samuccaya (ज्ञानकर्मणोः समुच्चयानुपपत्तिः):** The combination or integration of knowledge and action.

**Structural Elements:**

1. **Arjuna’s Confusion:**
   Arjuna expresses his bewilderment over Krishna's instructions, questioning why he is being asked to engage in severe action if understanding is deemed superior.

2. **Śaṅkara’s Critique of Misinterpretation:**
   Śaṅkara identifies that Krishna’s statements, though meant to prioritize knowledge, come across as convoluted and misleading, causing confusion in the intellect.

3. **Logical Inconsistency:**
   If both knowledge and action are to be undertaken simultaneously by a single individual, as implied by Krishna’s earlier statements, then Arjuna's protest against engaging in severe action lacks logical basis. The commentary points out the inconsistency in advocating for a combined approach while Arjuna perceives a hierarchy favoring knowledge.

4. **Scriptural Authority:**
   Śaṅkara emphasizes that if Krishna had indeed meant to separate knowledge and action strictly, the discourse would have been clear, and Arjuna’s singular focus would be justified. Since that is not the case, the combination of knowledge and action stands as the legitimate path.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Reference to Gītā Verses:**
  The commentary directly refers to Bhagavad Gītā 3.2 and earlier verses, highlighting Arjuna’s questions that stem from Krishna’s teachings.

- **Consistency with Prior Arguments:**
  Śaṅkara maintains consistency with his earlier assertions that knowledge and action, while distinct, are not mutually exclusive but rather integrated paths toward liberation.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Rationality):**
From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are guided by universal laws and rational duty. Arjuna’s questioning aligns with Kantian ethics in seeking clarity on moral obligations. If knowledge (pure reason) is superior, then actions (practical reason) should align seamlessly without causing moral dissonance. Śaṅkara’s commentary addresses this by asserting that both knowledge and action must be integrated, ensuring that moral duties (karma) do not contradict rational understanding (buddhi).

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**
Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the self’s active role in shaping reality through action. Arjuna’s dilemma reflects the self’s struggle between understanding and performing duties. Śaṅkara’s analysis supports Fichte’s idea that true self-realization involves both internal knowledge and external action, advocating for a unified approach where the self engages with the world through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Arjuna’s confusion represents the antithesis to Krishna’s thesis of knowledge superiority. Śaṅkara’s commentary seeks a synthesis by demonstrating that knowledge and action are not opposing forces but complementary aspects of the spiritual journey. This resolution aligns with Hegelian thought, where contradictions are transcended through a higher unity.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and its commentary deepen the exploration of the interplay between knowledge and action in the path to liberation. Technically, Śaṅkara dismantles the apparent inconsistency in Arjuna’s questioning by reaffirming that knowledge and action are harmoniously integrated rather than hierarchically opposed. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by upholding universal duties, Fichtean self-striving through both knowledge and action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by resolving the conflict between understanding and performing duties.

Arjuna’s question serves as a catalyst for elucidating the essential unity of knowledge and action, ensuring that the path to mokṣa is neither purely contemplative nor entirely action-based but a coherent combination of both. This integrated approach preserves the integrity of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the Gītā, emphasizing that true liberation is achieved through a balanced and disciplined engagement with both intellect and duty.
