### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“Furthermore, O Arjuna, understand action as arising from Brahman, and Brahman as the origin of the imperishable. Therefore, know that Brahman is all-pervading and is eternally established in sacrifice (yajña).” (Gītā 3.15)
```

**Śaṅkara’s Commentary**
```
Śrī Bhagavān explains that action (karma) arises from Brahman, who is the origin and the illuminating cause. Recognize that karma arises from Brahman. Furthermore, understand Brahman as the origin of the imperishable (akṣara), which is the supreme soul (paramātmā). Since Brahman is directly known as the imperishable and eternal, and because Brahman illuminates all purposes, Brahman is all-pervading. Moreover, Brahman is eternally established in yajña (sacrifice) due to its predominance in sacrificial rituals. Thus, yajña serves as the foundational establishment of Brahman in all actions.

   - **Karma from Brahman:** The verse begins by establishing that all actions (karma) arise from Brahman, the supreme reality.
   - **Brahman from Akṣara:** Brahman is further identified as the origin of the imperishable (akṣara), linking it to the eternal soul.

2. **All-Pervading Nature of Brahman:**
   - Brahman is described as sarvagatam (all-pervading), emphasizing its omnipresence and integral role in the cosmos.

3. **Eternal Establishment in Yajña:**
   - Brahman is eternally established in yajña, indicating that sacrificial actions are a means through which Brahman maintains its presence and cosmic order.

**Logical Progression:**

1. **From Brahman to Karma:**
   - All actions originate from Brahman, implying that performing duty is inherently connected to the divine.

2. **Brahman as the Source of the Imperishable:**
   - By understanding Brahman as the origin of the imperishable, one recognizes the eternal aspect of both the self (ātman) and Brahman.

3. **Yajña as the Foundation of Brahman's Presence:**
   - The establishment of Brahman in yajña signifies that sacrificial actions are not mere rituals but essential practices for sustaining cosmic and societal harmony.

**Textual Integration:**

- **Consistency with Earlier Verses:**
  - This verse builds upon the previous discussions on the importance of performing duty without attachment. By establishing the divine origin of action, Śaṅkara reinforces the necessity of duty-bound actions as expressions of one's connection to Brahman.

- **Alignment with Vedic and Upaniṣadic Teachings:**
  - The emphasis on yajña aligns with Vedic injunctions that advocate for ritual sacrifices to maintain cosmic order. Upaniṣadic teachings further elucidate the connection between action (karma), knowledge (jñāna), and the ultimate reality (Brahman).

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing karma as originating from Brahman aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating for actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. By performing actions (karma) in alignment with universal duty, one adheres to a moral law that transcends personal biases, ensuring ethical consistency. Kant would appreciate Śaṅkara’s focus on duty-bound actions that contribute to a universal order, reflecting the categorical imperative.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform karma as originating from Brahman resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in duty to achieve personal and collective well-being. This balance between inward understanding (knowledge of Brahman) and outward action (karma) ensures that self-realization involves both intellectual and practical endeavors, aligning with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined action informed by understanding.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, the potential conflict between renouncing action and performing duty is reconciled by Śaṅkara’s teaching that karma originates from Brahman, thereby integrating action with the ultimate reality. This synthesis ensures that duty-bound actions are not contradictory to spiritual pursuits but are harmonious expressions of the divine will. Hegelian philosophy would view this as achieving a higher unity where action and knowledge complement each other, leading to a comprehensive spiritual path.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary underscore the fundamental connection between Brahman (the ultimate reality), karma (action), and yajña (sacrifice). Technically, it establishes that all actions arise from Brahman and that Brahman is the eternal, all-pervading principle established through yajña. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through both knowledge and action, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating action and knowledge into a cohesive spiritual path.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Divine Origin of Action:**
   - Recognizing that all actions (karma) originate from Brahman emphasizes the sacredness and purposefulness of performing one's duties.

2. **Integration of Action and Knowledge:**
   - Understanding the relationship between Brahman and karma fosters a balanced approach where actions are informed by spiritual knowledge, ensuring ethical and purposeful living.

3. **Role of Yajña in Cosmic Order:**
   - Yajña is not merely a ritualistic practice but a means through which Brahman maintains cosmic and societal harmony, highlighting the importance of selfless, duty-bound actions.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - The integration of duty (karma), knowledge (jñāna), and ultimate reality (Brahman) ensures a harmonious and holistic approach to spiritual liberation (mokṣa).

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (mokṣa) is achieved through the disciplined, selfless performance of duty (karma) as an expression of one's connection to Brahman, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
