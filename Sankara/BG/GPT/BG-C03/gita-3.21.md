### Translation (English)

**Verse**
```
“O Arjuna, why is the maintenance of the world considered a duty?

Because whatever action is performed by the superior persons, others follow suit.

Whatever action people undertake based on such a model, the world follows that pattern.” (Gītā 3.21)
```

### Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Translation)

Śaṅkara explains that the maintenance (**lokasaṅgraha**) of the world is considered a duty because the actions performed by the superior individuals (śreṣṭhas) set a precedent for others to follow. When the virtuous perform their duties diligently and selflessly, they become role models for society. Consequently, others imitate these exemplary actions, thereby sustaining social and cosmic order. Thus, by performing one’s duty, an individual contributes to the overall well-being and harmony of the world.

### Philosophical Analysis

**Kantian Perspective (Duty and Universal Law):**

From Immanuel Kant’s standpoint, moral actions are governed by universalizable principles and rational duty. Śaṅkara’s emphasis on performing duty aligns with Kantian ethics by advocating actions based on duty rather than personal inclination or desire. Kant would interpret Śaṅkara’s teaching as an expression of the categorical imperative, where one acts according to maxims that can be universally applied. By performing one’s duty selflessly, individuals uphold universal moral laws, ensuring ethical consistency and integrity.

**Fichtean Perspective (Self-Positing and Striving):**

Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s philosophy emphasizes the active role of the self in shaping reality through moral and practical engagement. Śaṅkara’s directive to perform duty resonates with Fichtean thought by recognizing that the self must actively engage in societal roles and duties to achieve personal and collective well-being. By emulating exemplary individuals, one contributes to the moral fabric of society, fostering self-realization and ethical development. This balance between inward understanding and outward action aligns with Fichte’s ideal of self-actualization through disciplined, duty-bound action informed by ethical duty.

**Hegelian Perspective (Dialectical Unity):**

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s dialectic involves resolving contradictions through a higher synthesis. In this context, Arjuna’s initial confusion represents a dialectical tension between renouncing action and performing duty. Śaṅkara’s commentary resolves this by demonstrating that selfless action (karma-yoga) is not contradictory to the pursuit of knowledge but rather complements it. This synthesis ensures that the spiritual path is comprehensive, balancing both action and knowledge, and leading to a unified approach to liberation. Hegelian philosophy would view Śaṅkara’s resolution as achieving a higher unity where duty-bound actions align with ethical and spiritual principles, fostering holistic development and spiritual harmony.

### Systematic Integration and Conclusion

This verse and Śaṅkara’s commentary underscore the critical role of performing one’s duty (**kartavya**) in maintaining societal and cosmic order (**lokasaṅgrahaḥ**). Technically, it establishes that the actions of exemplary individuals serve as models for others, ensuring the continuity and harmony of society. Philosophically, the analysis aligns with Kantian ethics by emphasizing duty-bound actions, Fichtean self-striving through active engagement in societal roles, and Hegelian dialectical unity by integrating duty with spiritual knowledge.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Integration of Duty and Cosmic Order:**
   - Performing one’s duties selflessly ensures the maintenance of societal and cosmic harmony, contributing to the greater good.

2. **Role of Exemplary Individuals:**
   - Exemplary actions by virtuous individuals set a standard for others, fostering a culture of ethical behavior and mutual respect.

3. **Moral and Spiritual Responsibility:**
   - Emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one’s duties not just for personal well-being but for the collective welfare of society.

4. **Philosophical Harmony:**
   - Aligns ethical duty with philosophical principles, ensuring a balanced and harmonious approach to life that fosters both material prosperity and spiritual liberation.

Thus, Śaṅkara reinforces that true liberation (**mokṣa**) is achieved through the harmonious integration of disciplined, selfless action (**karma-yoga**) and detached engagement, maintaining both logical consistency and doctrinal integrity within the Bhagavad Gītā’s teachings.
