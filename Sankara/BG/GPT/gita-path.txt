# The Path Structure of the Bhagavad Gita

## I. **Prajna-Pada: The Science of Supreme Being (Chapter 2)**

### A. **Fundamental Principles**
- Chapter 2 introduces the foundational principles marking the beginning of the path.
- Focuses on **Prajna** (Direct Insight/Pure Reason) as the starting point.

### B. **Pratyahara-Dharana Conjunction**
- Establishes the conjunction of **Pratyahara** (withdrawal of senses) and **Dharana** (concentration).
- Emphasizes the simplicity of Prajna-Pada in establishing Pure Reason.

### C. **Internal Development**
1. **Determination and Reflection**
   - **Vitarka** (deliberation): Determination of Being.
   - **Vicara** (discernment): Reflection on Being.

2. **Dharana as the Truth of Prajna**
   - Covered within Chapter 2.
   - Sets the stage for deeper understanding through concentrated insight.

## II. **Dharma-Pada: The Science of Realization (Chapters 3–6)**

### A. **Complex Determination**
- Dharma-Pada encompasses **Karma-Shine-Dhyana**.
- **Karma** represents determinate/existential action and functional relations of doing.

### B. **Kriya as Sensibility**
- **Kriya** (action) corresponds to sensibility and the perceptible realm.
- Path of action includes **Asana** (posture), **Pranayama** (breath control), **Pratyahara** (sense withdrawal).

### C. **Integration of Karma and Dharma**
1. **Karma Yoga (Chapters 3–5)**
   - Focus on selfless action without attachment.
   - Manifestation of actual determinate Dharma through functional action.

2. **Dhyana Yoga (Chapter 6)**
   - Meditative realization leading towards deeper concentration.
   - Although **Dhyana** (meditation) as the truth of Dharma is a significant undertaking, it is currently being deferred.

## III. **Jnana-Pada: The Science of Knowledge (Chapter 7)**

### A. **Return to Being**
- **Jnana** represents **Not-Not-Being**, a return to Being with the essential relation intact.
- Simpler than Dharma-Pada, focuses on higher knowledge and wisdom.

### B. **Triad of Intelligible Substance**
- **Prajna-Dharma-Jnana** form the triad of **Intelligible Substance**.
- Abstracts from **Kriya** (perceptible/sensible substance) to intelligible understanding.

### C. **Integration**
- Completes the understanding of intelligible substance through pure reason, realization, and knowledge.
- Achieves unity through apperception (self-awareness).

## IV. **Study of Jnana and Vijnana (Chapter 7)**

### A. **Samadhi as Completion**
- Chapter 7 delves into **Jnana** (knowledge) and **Vijnana** (realized knowledge), corresponding to **Samadhi** (absorption).
- In the **Samyama** triad of **Dharana-Dhyana-Samadhi**, focus is on **Samadhi**, the culmination of concentration and meditation.

### B. **Bypassing Dhyana**
- **Dhyana** as the truth of Dharma is acknowledged but temporarily set aside.
- Emphasis is on achieving completion through Samadhi.

## V. **Sublation into the Absolute (Chapter 8)**

### A. **Immutable Brahman**
- Chapter 8 discusses the **Akshara Brahman** (Immutable Brahman).
- Brahman is approached as **Immutable Substance**, the ultimate reality beyond change.

### B. **Transcendence**
- Sublation (overcoming and preserving) of the intelligible substance triad into the Absolute.
- Movement beyond unified understanding into **Absolute Oneness**.

## VI. **Transition to Brahman as Self**

### A. **Beyond Immutable Substance**
- Recognizing that Brahman transcends being mere immutable substance and is the **Self**.
- Aligns with **Fichte's Science of Knowing**, moving from substance to self-realization.

### B. **Vivekajam Jnana**
- **Vivekajam Jnana** (knowledge born of discrimination) reveals Brahman as the Self.
- Transitions from knowledge of substance to the direct realization of the Self.

## **Philosophical Framework**

### A. **Dyadic Structures**

1. **Unconditioned Dyad (Prajna:Dharma)**
   - Represents the **Absolute Condition**.
   - **Prajna** and **Dharma** form a dyad of unconditioned reality.

2. **Conditioned Dyad (Kriya:Jnana)**
   - Represents the **Conditioned** aspects of experience.
   - **Kriya** (action) and **Jnana** (knowledge) form a dyad of conditioned phenomena.

### B. **Integration of Triads and Dyads**

1. **Prajna-Dharma-Jnana Triad**
   - Constitutes **Intelligible Substance**.
   - Abstracts from the perceptible realm (Kriya) to the realm of pure understanding.

2. **Kriya as Sensible Substance**
   - Represents the perceptible or sensible realm of action and experience.
   - Forms the basis from which intelligible substance is abstracted.

### C. **Unity Through Progression**

1. **From Prajna to Jnana**
   - Progression from initial insight (**Prajna**) through realization (**Dharma**) to knowledge (**Jnana**).
   - Each stage builds upon and integrates the previous.

2. **Culmination in Samadhi and Akshara Brahman**
   - Culminates in **Samadhi**, leading to understanding of the **Immutable Brahman**.
   - Moves beyond dualities to realize **Brahman as Self**.

### D. **Philosophical Parallels**

1. **Relation between Dharma and Karma**
   - Mirrors the distinction between relation and function.
   - **Karma** deals with the functional aspects of doing—actual, determinate Dharma.

2. **Nondual Reason as Absolute Oneness**
   - Informed by the philosophies of **Fichte** and **Hegel**.
   - **Nondual Reason** underlies the entire path as the foundation of Absolute Oneness.

## **Conclusion**

The path structure of the Bhagavad Gita, analyzed through a pure **Abhidharmic** lens and informed by **Fichte** and **Hegel**, unfolds as a progressive journey:

- **Prajna-Pada** (Chapter 2): Establishes foundational principles and pure reason.
- **Dharma-Pada** (Chapters 3–6): Explores realization through action (**Karma**) and the complexities of determinate existence.
- **Jnana-Pada** (Chapter 7): Returns to the essence of Being with knowledge that integrates essential relations.
- **Study of Jnana and Vijnana** (Chapter 7): Focuses on **Samadhi**, achieving completion through absorbed contemplation.
- **Sublation into the Absolute** (Chapter 8): Transcends intelligible substance to realize the **Immutable Brahman**.
- **Transition to Brahman as Self**: Moves beyond substance to the direct realization of Brahman as the Self through **Vivekajam Jnana**.

**Overall Pathway:**

1. **Prajna** (Pure Reason)
2. **Kriya** (Action/Sensibility)
3. **Jnana** (Knowledge)
4. **Dharma** (Realization)

This pathway reflects the pattern **Prajna:Kriya:Jnana:Dharma**, integrating conditioned and unconditioned realities. It illustrates how the seeker moves from the perceptible realm of action to the intelligible realm of understanding, culminating in the nondual realization of Absolute Oneness.

By aligning the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita with the philosophical insights of Fichte and Hegel, the path emphasizes that true wisdom lies in recognizing the Self as Brahman, transcending all dualities and conditions.
