### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Understand (*vidyāt*) that yoga is the disconnection (*viyoga*) from union with suffering (*duḥkhasaṃyoga*).
The term *duḥkhasaṃyoga* refers to union with suffering, and *viyoga* means separation from it.
Thus, *duḥkhasaṃyogaviyoga* is the state of being free from suffering, which is called yoga (*yogasaṃjñitam*).
Know this by its contrary characteristic—freedom from suffering.

After summarizing the fruit of yoga (*yogaphalam*), the necessity of undertaking yoga practice is reintroduced,
with the intention of prescribing determination (*niścaya*) and freedom from despondency (*anirveda*) as essential aids in yoga.

Such yoga, which leads to the described results, should be practiced (*yoktavyaḥ*) with firm resolve (*niścayena adhyavasāyena*),
and with a mind (*cetaḥ*) free from despondency (*anirviṇṇam*).
What is meant by *anirviṇṇacetasā*? A mind devoid of despair (*nirvedarahitaṃ cetaḥ*), steadfast in its focus.
