### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Does the one who, having fallen from both paths (*ubhayavibhraṣṭaḥ*),
from the path of action (*karmamārga*) as well as from the path of yoga (*yogamārga*),
perish like a broken cloud (*chinnābhram iva naśyati*),

or does such a person not perish?
Left without support (*apratītiṣṭhaḥ nirāśrayaḥ*), O mighty-armed one (*he mahābāho*),
confused and deluded (*vimūḍhaḥ san*) on the path to Brahman (*brahmaṇaḥ pathi*),
does this person fail to attain their goal?

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Raises the concern of someone deviating from both the path of action and the path of yoga.
- **Second Clause:** Questions the fate of such a person, comparing them to a scattered cloud and expressing uncertainty about their spiritual progress.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Deviation from Both Paths (उभयविभ्रष्ट):**
   - The *ubhayavibhraṣṭaḥ* refers to a person who abandons both the path of action (*karmamārga*) and the path of yoga (*yogamārga*).
   - This state reflects an incomplete or disrupted spiritual journey.

2. **Scattered Cloud (छिन्नाभ्रमिव):**
   - The analogy of a broken cloud (*chinnābhram*) highlights a lack of direction, purpose, and support, emphasizing the precarious state of such a seeker.

3. **Lack of Support (अप्रतिष्ठः):**
   - The person is described as *apratītiṣṭhaḥ*, meaning without a firm foundation or refuge, drifting without clear guidance.

4. **Confusion on the Path (विमूढः):**
   - Being *vimūḍhaḥ*, the seeker is deluded or confused about the path to Brahman (*brahmaṇaḥ pathi*), reflecting uncertainty and doubt in their spiritual progress.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Uncertainty in Spiritual Progress:**
   - Arjuna expresses concern for those who neither fully engage in action nor complete the path of yoga, questioning whether their efforts are wasted.

2. **Role of Divine Guidance:**
   - By addressing Krishna, Arjuna seeks reassurance and clarity on the fate of such seekers, emphasizing the importance of divine intervention and wisdom.

3. **Spiritual Support and Direction:**
   - The verse underscores the necessity of steadfast effort and guidance to avoid spiritual disorientation and incompleteness.

4. **Continuity in Spiritual Growth:**
   - The question anticipates Krishna’s response, which will affirm the enduring nature of spiritual progress and the continuity of efforts across lifetimes.
