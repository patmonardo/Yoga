## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
हे पार्थ नैव इह लोके नामुत्र परस्मिन् वा लोके विनाशः तस्य विद्यते नास्ति।
नाशो नाम पूर्वस्मात् हीनजन्मप्राप्तिः स योगभ्रष्टस्य नास्ति।

न हि यस्मात् कल्याणकृत् शुभकृत् कश्चित् दुर्गतिं कुत्सितां गतिं।
हे तात, तनोति आत्मानं पुत्ररूपेण इति पिता तात उच्यते।
पितैव पुत्र इति पुत्रोऽपि तात उच्यते। शिष्योऽपि पुत्र उच्यते।
यतो न गच्छति॥ ४०॥

### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**He pārtha naiveha loke nāmutra parasmin vā loke vināśaḥ tasya vidyate nāsti।
Nāśo nāma pūrvasmāt hīnajamnaprāptiḥ sa yogabhraṣṭasya nāsti।

Na hi yasmāt kalyāṇakṛt śubhakṛt kaścit durgatiṃ kutsitāṃ gatiṃ।
He tāta, tanoti ātmānaṃ putrarūpeṇa iti pitā tāta ucyate।
Pitaiva putra iti putro’pi tāta ucyate। Śiṣyo’pi putra ucyate।
Yato na gacchati॥ 40॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
O Pārtha (*he pārtha*), neither in this world (*iha loke*) nor in the next world (*nāmutra parasmin vā loke*) is there destruction (*vināśaḥ*) for that person (*tasya*).
For the one who has fallen from yoga (*yogabhraṣṭasya*), destruction in the form of being born into an inferior state (*pūrvasmāt hīnajamnaprāptiḥ*) does not occur.

Indeed (*na hi*), no one who performs good deeds (*kalyāṇakṛt śubhakṛt*) ever attains a bad end (*durgatiṃ kutsitāṃ gatiṃ*).

O dear one (*he tāta*), "tāta" signifies a father who extends himself (*tanoti ātmānaṃ*) through his son.
By this logic, the son is also referred to as "tāta," and even a disciple (*śiṣya*) is called a "putra" (son).
Thus, no one who performs good deeds reaches a bad destination.
