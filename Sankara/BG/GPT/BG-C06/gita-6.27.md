### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The yogī whose mind (*manas*) has become profoundly tranquil (*praśānta*) is described as having attained inner peace (*praśāntamanāḥ*).
For such a yogī, the supreme bliss (*sukham uttamam*), unparalleled and infinite, comes to them (*upaiti upagacchati*).

This bliss arises in one who is *śāntarajasa*—free from the disturbances of rajas,
which refers to the diminishing of delusion and afflictions caused by rajas (*mohādikleśarajasaṃ*).

Such a yogī is *brahmabhūta*—established in Brahman, liberated while living (*jīvanmukta*),
with the firm realization that "Brahman alone is all" (*Brahmaiva sarvam*).

They are also described as *akalmaṣa*—free from impurities such as dharma and adharma, meaning beyond the dualities of virtue and vice.
