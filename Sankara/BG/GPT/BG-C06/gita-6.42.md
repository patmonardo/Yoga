### Sanskrit Commentary
अथवा श्रीमतां कुलात् अन्यस्मिन् योगिनामेव दरिद्राणां कुले भवति जायते धीमताम्।
एतत् हि जन्म, यत् दरिद्राणां योगिनां कुले, दुर्लभतरं दुःखलभ्यतरं पूर्वमपेक्ष्य।

### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**Athavā śrīmatāṃ kulāt anyasmin yoginām eva daridrāṇāṃ kule bhavati jāyate dhīmatām।
Etat hi janma, yat daridrāṇāṃ yogināṃ kule, durlabhataram duḥkhalabhyataram pūrvamapekṣya।
Loke janma yat īdṛśaṃ yathoktaviśeṣaṇe kule॥ 42॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Alternatively (*athavā*), if not born into a prosperous family of virtuous individuals (*śrīmatāṃ kulāt*),
one is born into the family of yogīs (*yoginām eva*), even if they are poor (*daridrāṇāṃ kule*), endowed with wisdom (*dhīmatām*).

Such a birth (*etat janma*), being in the family of poor but wise yogīs, is even rarer (*durlabhataram*),
more difficult to attain (*duḥkhalabhyataram*) compared to the previously mentioned possibility (*pūrvamapekṣya*).

A birth in such a family (*īdṛśaṃ kule*), characterized by the virtues previously described (*yathoktaviśeṣaṇe*), is indeed exceptional (*durlabhataram loke janma*).
