### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The ascetic (*saṃnyāsī*) who has embarked on the path of yoga (*yogamārge pravṛttaḥ*),
due to their merits (*sāmarthyāt*), attains the worlds of the virtuous (*puṇyakṛtām lokān*),
those who have performed great sacrifices like the *aśvamedha* (*aśvamedhādiyājināṃ lokān*).

There, they dwell (*uṣitvā*) and experience enjoyment (*vāsaṃ anubhūya*) for many years (*śāśvatīḥ samāḥ*).

Upon the exhaustion of those enjoyments (*tadbhogakṣaye*),
they are reborn into a pure (*śucīnām*) and prosperous (*śrīmatāṃ*) family,
endowed with wealth and virtues (*vibhūtimatāṃ gehe*).
Such is the rebirth of the one fallen from yoga (*yogabhraṣṭaḥ abhijāyate*).

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Intermediate Reward (पुण्यकृतां लोकान्):**
   - The *yogabhraṣṭaḥ* (one fallen from yoga) gains access to the worlds of the virtuous (*puṇyakṛtām lokān*), indicating that spiritual efforts are rewarded even when incomplete.
   - These are the realms of those who perform great sacrifices, like the *aśvamedha*.

2. **Duration of Stay (शाश्वतीः समाः):**
   - The yogī enjoys the fruits of these virtuous deeds for a prolonged period, described as eternal (*śāśvatīḥ*), though this refers to an extensive but finite duration (*nityāḥ samāḥ*).

3. **Rebirth in a Noble Family (शुचीनां श्रीमतां गेहे):**
   - Upon exhausting their karmic merit (*tadbhogakṣaye*), they are reborn into a pure and wealthy family (*śucīnām śrīmatāṃ gehe*).
   - Such families provide an environment conducive to resuming spiritual progress.

4. **Continuity of Effort:**
   - The yogī’s rebirth into a favorable setting ensures that their previous efforts are not wasted, but instead serve as the foundation for further advancement.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Assurance for Seekers:**
   - Krishna assures that even incomplete spiritual efforts bear fruit, offering motivation to persist on the path of yoga.

2. **Value of Purity and Prosperity:**
   - Being born into a virtuous (*śucī*) and affluent (*śrīmat*) family highlights the importance of an environment that supports spiritual pursuits.

3. **Intermediate Rewards in Spirituality:**
