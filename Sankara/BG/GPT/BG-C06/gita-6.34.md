Tasyāhaṃ nigrahaṃ manye vāyor iva suduṣkaram॥ 34॥**

## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
चञ्चलं हि मनः।
कृष्ण इति कृषतेः विलेखनार्थस्य रूपम्।
भक्तजनपापादिदोषाकर्षणात् कृष्णः, तस्य सम्बुद्धिः हे कृष्ण।

हि यस्मात् मनः चञ्चलं न केवलं अत्यर्थं चञ्चलम्, प्रमाथि च प्रमथनशीलम्।
प्रमथ्नाति शरीरम् इन्द्रियाणि च विक्षिपत् सत् परवशीकरोति।

किञ्च—बलवत् प्रबलम्, न केनचित् नियन्तुं शक्यम्, दुर्निवारत्वात्।
किञ्च—दृढं तन्तुनागवत् अच्छेद्यम्।

तस्य एवंभूतस्य मनसः अहं निग्रहं निरोधं मन्ये।
वायोरिव यथा वायोः दुष्करो निग्रहः ततोऽपि दुष्करं मन्ये इत्यभिप्रायः॥ ३४॥

### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**Cañcalaṃ hi manaḥ।
Kṛṣṇa iti kṛṣateḥ vilekhanārthasya rūpam।
Bhaktajanapāpādidōṣākārṣaṇāt kṛṣṇaḥ, tasya sambuddhiḥ he kṛṣṇa।

Hi yasmāt manaḥ cañcalaṃ na kevalaṃ atyarthaṃ cañcalam, pramāthi ca pramathanaśīlam।
Pramathnāti śarīram indriyāṇi ca vikṣipat sat paravaśīkaroti।

Kiñca—balavat prabalam, na kenacit niyantuṃ śakyam, durnivāratvāt।
Kiñca—dṛḍhaṃ tantunāgavat acchedyam।

Tasya evaṃbhūtasya manasaḥ ahaṃ nigrahaṃ nirodhaṃ manye।
Vāyor iva yathā vāyoḥ duṣkaro nigrahaḥ tato’pi duṣkaraṃ manye ity abhiprāyaḥ॥ 34॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The mind is indeed restless (*cañcalaṃ*),
and not only restless but also turbulent (*pramāthi*),
which means it has the nature of agitating (*pramathanaśīlaṃ*) the body and the senses,
causing their distraction and rendering them subordinate (*paravaśīkaroti*).

Further, the mind is strong (*balavat*) and difficult to restrain (*na kenacit niyantuṃ śakyam*),
being uncontrollable due to its forceful nature (*durnivāratva*).

Additionally, the mind is unyielding (*dṛḍhaṃ*), like a reinforced cable (*tantunāga*), which cannot be easily broken.

Considering such characteristics of the mind,
I believe its restraint (*nigrahaṃ*) to be as difficult as controlling the wind (*vāyoḥ duṣkaraṃ*),
or perhaps even more difficult (*tato’pi duṣkaraṃ manye*).

This, O Krishna (*he kṛṣṇa*), is my conclusion.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Arjuna describes the nature of the mind as restless, turbulent, strong, and unyielding.
- **Second Clause:** He compares the difficulty of restraining the mind to controlling the wind.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Nature of the Mind (चञ्चलं, प्रमाथि, बलवत्, दृढम्):**
   - The mind is inherently restless (*cañcalaṃ*) and perpetually in motion.
   - It is also turbulent (*pramāthi*), with the power to disturb the body and senses, making it hard to focus.
   - Its strength (*balavat*) makes it nearly impossible to control, and its unyielding nature (*dṛḍham*) resists restraint.

2. **Comparison to the Wind (वायोरिव):**
   - Controlling the mind is likened to controlling the wind, emphasizing its elusive and uncontrollable nature.
   - This comparison highlights the immense challenge faced by practitioners in achieving mental discipline.

3. **Acknowledgment of Difficulty:**
   - Śaṅkara underscores Arjuna’s humility in recognizing the difficulty of mental control,
     aligning with the Gītā’s emphasis on perseverance in yoga despite such challenges.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Mental Discipline as a Core Challenge:**
   - The verse highlights the restless nature of the mind as a significant obstacle in the path of yoga.

2. **Role of Effort and Perseverance:**
   - While acknowledging the difficulty, the verse implies the necessity of persistent effort in mastering the mind.

3. **Invocation of Divine Guidance:**
   - By addressing Krishna as *Madhusūdana* (slayer of demons), Arjuna subtly seeks divine guidance to overcome this challenge.
