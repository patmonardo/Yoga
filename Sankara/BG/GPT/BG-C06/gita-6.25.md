### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Gradually (*śanaiḥ śanaiḥ*), step by step, let one withdraw the mind (*uparamet*), not suddenly (*na sahasā*).
This withdrawal should be accomplished through the intellect (*buddhyā*).

What kind of intellect? One sustained by fortitude (*dhṛtigṛhītayā*), where *dhṛti* refers to firmness or patience.
An intellect endowed with perseverance and steadiness (*dhairyeṇa yuktā*) is essential for this process.

The mind should be established in the self (*ātmasaṃstham*), meaning that it rests in the understanding that
"the self alone is everything, and there is nothing apart from it" (*ātmaiva sarvaṃ na tato’nya kiñcid asti*).

Having thus fixed the mind on the self (*ātmasaṃsthaṃ manaḥ kṛtvā*), one should not think of anything else (*na kiñcid api cintayet*).
This is the highest discipline (*parama vidhiḥ*) of yoga.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Encourages gradual withdrawal and emphasizes the use of intellect sustained by fortitude.
- **Second Clause:** Instructs focusing the mind entirely on the self and avoiding all other thoughts.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Gradual Withdrawal (शनैः शनैः):**
   - The process of withdrawing the mind from external distractions is described as gradual (*śanaiḥ śanaiḥ*), avoiding abrupt or forced efforts.
   - This underscores the need for patience and steadiness in yoga practice.

2. **Role of Intellect and Fortitude (बुद्ध्या धृतिगृहीतया):**
   - The withdrawal is to be achieved through the intellect (*buddhi*), which is fortified by perseverance and firmness (*dhṛti*).
   - This emphasizes the importance of inner strength and clarity of thought.

3. **Fixing the Mind in the Self (आत्मसंस्थं मनः):**
   - The mind should be established in the understanding that the self is the ultimate reality (*ātmaiva sarvaṃ*).
   - This alignment of the mind with the self leads to a state where external distractions are entirely abandoned.

4. **Freedom from Thought (न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत्):**
   - Once the mind is fixed in the self, one should let go of all other thoughts, attaining a state of complete mental absorption.
   - Śaṅkara highlights this as the pinnacle of yoga practice (*parama vidhiḥ*).

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Patience in Practice:**
   - The gradual approach to mental withdrawal reflects the Gītā’s emphasis on disciplined and sustainable spiritual progress.

2. **Union with the Self:**
   - The verse underscores the central goal of yoga as aligning the mind with the self, transcending all dualities and distractions.

3. **Yoga as Supreme Discipline:**
   - By defining yoga as the complete focus of the mind on the self, the verse places it as the ultimate practice for spiritual realization.
