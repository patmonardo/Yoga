## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
प्रशान्तात्मा प्रकर्षेण शान्तः आत्मा अन्तःकरणं यस्य सोऽयं प्रशान्तात्मा,
विगतभीः विगतभयः,
ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः ब्रह्मचारिणो व्रतं ब्रह्मचर्यं गुरुशुश्रूषा-भिक्षान्नभुक्त्यादि तस्मिन् स्थितः, तदनुष्ठाता भवेदित्यर्थः।

किञ्च, मनः संयम्य मनसः वृत्तीः उपसंहृत्य इत्येतत्,
मच्चित्तः मयि परमेश्वरे चित्तं यस्य सोऽयं मच्चित्तः,
युक्तः समाहितः सन् आसीत उपविशेत्।
मत्परः अहं परो यस्य सोऽयं मत्परो भवति।

कश्चित् रागी स्त्रीचित्तः, न तु स्त्रियमेव परत्वेन गृह्णाति; किं तर्हि? राजानं महादेवं वा।
अयं तु मच्चित्तो मत्परश्च॥ १४॥

### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**Praśāntātmā prakarṣeṇa śāntaḥ ātmā antaḥkaraṇaṃ yasya so’yaṃ praśāntātmā,

brahmacārivrate sthitaḥ brahmacāriṇo vrataṃ brahmacaryaṃ guruśuśrūṣā-bhikṣānna-bhuktyādi tasmin sthitaḥ, tad anuṣṭhātā bhaved ity arthaḥ।

Matparaḥ ahaṃ paro yasya so’yaṃ matparo bhavati।

Kaścit rāgī strīcittaḥ, na tu striyam eva paratvena gṛhṇāti; kiṃ tarhi? Rājānaṃ mahādevaṃ vā।
Ayaṃ tu maccitto matparaś ca॥ 14॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The one whose mind (*antaḥkaraṇa*) is completely calm (*praśānta*),
who is free from fear (*vigatabhīḥ*),
and who is established in the vow of celibacy (*brahmacārivrate sthitaḥ*), which involves practices such as service to the teacher (*guruśuśrūṣā*) and sustenance through alms (*bhikṣānna-bhuktyādi*), is considered disciplined.

Further, controlling the tendencies (*vṛttiḥ*) of the mind (*manaḥ saṃyamya*),
and focusing the mind on Me (*maccittaḥ*), the Supreme Lord (*Parameśvara*),
one should sit (*āsīta*), remaining disciplined (*yuktaḥ*) and steadfast.

The term *matparaḥ* means one for whom I am the supreme goal.

For example, a person’s mind might be attached (*rāgī*) to a woman, but that person does not regard the woman as the ultimate goal. Instead, they may consider a king or a great deity (*mahādeva*) as the ultimate goal.
However, in this case, the yogī’s mind is both focused on Me (*maccittaḥ*) and considers Me as the supreme goal (*matparaḥ*).
