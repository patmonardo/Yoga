Tatra yogī vidvān saṃśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ viśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ saṃśuddha-pāpaḥ।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Striving earnestly (*prayatnāt yatamānaḥ*), putting in greater effort (*adhikaṃ yatamānaḥ*),
the yogī, who is wise (*vidvān*), becomes purified of sins (*saṃśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ*),
meaning freed from all impurities and sins (*viśuddha-pāpaḥ*).

Through many lifetimes (*anekeṣu janmasu*), the yogī accumulates impressions (*saṃskārajātam*) bit by bit (*kiñcit kiñcit*),
and through these accumulated impressions (*upacitya*), perfected by efforts spanning many births (*anekajanmakṛtena saṃsiddhaḥ*),
the yogī becomes established in right knowledge (*labdha-samyagdarśanaḥ*).

From there (*tataḥ*), the yogī attains the supreme (*parāṃ prakṛṣṭāṃ*) goal (*gatim*).
