### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The yogī, one who meditates, should constantly engage the self (*ātmānaṃ*)—the inner faculty (*antaḥkaraṇa*)—in meditation, always (*satatam*) remaining in seclusion (*rahasi*), such as in a mountain cave (*giri-guha*) or other solitary places.

One should be alone (*ekākī*), without any companions (*asahāyaḥ*). The specific mention of “remaining in solitude and alone” implies that one must have renounced worldly life (*saṃnyāsaṃ kṛtvā*).

A yogī with controlled mind (*citta*), inner faculty (*antaḥkaraṇa*), and body (*deha*), is described as *yatacittātmā* (one whose mind and body are disciplined).

Such a person is free from desires (*nirāśīḥ*)—without any craving (*vītatṛṣṇaḥ*), and devoid of possessions (*aparigrahaḥ*)—one who is free from attachment to material objects.

Even while being in the state of renunciation (*saṃnyāsitva*), one should practice meditation by having relinquished all forms of possessions.
