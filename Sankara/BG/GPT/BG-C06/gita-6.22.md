### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Having attained the realization of the self (*yam ātmalābhaṃ*), one does not consider any other gain (*lābhāntaraṃ*) to be superior (*adhikam*).
This self-realization is seen as the highest achievement, leaving no desire for other acquisitions.

Moreover, being established (*yasmin sthitaḥ*) in the nature of the self (*ātmatattva*),
one is not shaken (*na vicālyate*) even by the greatest sorrow (*guruṇā duḥkhena*),
such as those arising from extreme afflictions like a weapon's strike (*śastranipātādilakṣaṇa*).

   - Once attained, no other acquisition (*lābhāntaraṃ*) is considered superior or even comparable.

   - Being established in the self (*ātmatattva sthitaḥ*) renders one immune to disturbances caused by external adversities, including extreme sorrow (*guruṇā duḥkhena*).
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes the profundity of this stability, which remains unshaken even by the gravest challenges.

   - Self-realization is depicted as the highest attainment, making all worldly gains inconsequential by comparison.

2. **Freedom from Suffering:**
