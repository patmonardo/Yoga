## Śaṅkarācārya’s Commentary

### Sanskrit (Devanagari)

एवं परमार्थसंन्यासकर्मयोगयोः कर्तृद्वारकं संन्याससामान्यमपेक्ष्य ‘यं संन्यासमिति प्राहुर्योगं तं विद्धि पाण्डव’ इति कर्मयोगस्य स्तुत्यर्थं संन्यासत्वम् उक्तम् ।
ध्यानयोगस्य फलनिरपेक्षः कर्मयोगो बहिरङ्गं साधनमिति तं संन्यासत्वेन स्तुत्वा अधुना कर्मयोगस्य ध्यानयोगसाधनत्वं दर्शयति —

आरुरुक्षोर्मुनेर्योगं कर्म कारणमुच्यते ।
योगारूढस्य तस्यैव शमः कारणमुच्यते ॥ ३ ॥

आरुरुक्षोः आरोढुमिच्छतः, अनारूढस्य, ध्यानयोगे अवस्थातुमशक्तस्यैवेत्यर्थः । कस्य तस्य आरुरुक्षोः ? मुनेः, कर्मफलसंन्यासिन इत्यर्थः । किमारुरुक्षोः ? योगम् । कर्म कारणं साधनम् उच्यते ।
योगारूढस्य पुनः तस्यैव शमः उपशमः सर्वकर्मभ्यो निवृत्तिः कारणं योगारूढस्य साधनम् उच्यते इत्यर्थः । यावद्यावत् कर्मभ्यः उपरमते, तावत्तावत् निरायासस्य जितेन्द्रियस्य चित्तं समाधीयते । तथा सति स झटिति योगारूढो भवति । तथा चोक्तं व्यासेन — ‘नैतादृशं ब्राह्मणस्यास्ति वित्तं यथैकता समता सत्यता च । शीलं स्थितिर्दण्डनिधानमार्जवं ततस्ततश्चोपरमः क्रियाभ्यः’ (मो. ध. १७५ । ३७) इति ॥ ३ ॥

### Translation (English)

"Thus, considering the general similarity in renunciation (saṃnyāsasāmānya) between genuine renunciation (paramārthasaṃnyāsa) and karmayoga in terms of the agent’s inner state, the previous verse said, ‘What they call “saṃnyāsa” know that also to be “yoga,” O Pāṇḍava,’ praising karmayoga by attributing ‘saṃnyāsatva’ (the status of renunciation) to it.

Having extolled karmayoga as a form of renunciation to highlight that it is an external means (bahiraṅga sādhanam) to dhyānayoga (meditation yoga) free from fruit-desire, now the text shows how karmayoga serves as a means to attain dhyānayoga:

‘For the sage aspiring to ascend to yoga (ārurukṣu), action (karma) is said to be the means. For that very individual who has ascended to yoga (yogārūḍha), tranquility (śama), meaning withdrawal from all actions, is said to be the means.’

‘Ārurukṣu’ means one who desires to ascend, i.e., the one not yet established in dhyānayoga and unable to remain steadily in meditation. Who is this ārurukṣu? A muni, i.e., one who has renounced the fruits of action. For this aspirant to yoga, karma is called the means (kāraṇam, sādhanam). For the one who has become established in yoga (yogārūḍha), that very person’s means is śama, the cessation from all activities.

The idea is that as one gradually withdraws from actions, the mind of a person who is free from agitation and has conquered the senses becomes concentrated. Thus, suddenly he becomes established in yoga. As Vyāsa says: ‘There is no wealth equal to oneness, equality, truthfulness for a Brāhmaṇa; character, steadiness, forbearance, and uprightness; and gradually, withdrawal from activities.’ (Mokṣa Dharma 175.37)"

## Technical Analysis

1. **Key Terms:**
   - **Ārurukṣu (आरुरुक्षुः):** One who seeks to ascend or become established in yoga but is not yet stable in meditation.
   - **Muni (मुनी):** A sage, specifically here one who is already practicing karmayoga by renouncing fruit-desires, thereby considered a ‘quiet’ or self-controlled individual.
   - **Yogārūḍha (योगारूढ):** One who has ‘mounted’ or become firmly established in yoga (meditation).
   - **Karma as Bahiraṅga Sādhana:** An external means to attain the readiness for dhyānayoga, implying that while one is not yet ready to sit still in meditation, performing duty-bound action without desire purifies the mind.
   - **Śama (शम):** Tranquility or calmness, here meaning cessation of all actions once one is stable enough to sustain meditative absorption.

2. **Structural Elements:**
   - This verse and commentary clarify a progression:
     - Aspiring yogī (ārurukṣu) → uses karmayoga (action without fruit-desire) to purify the mind.
     - Established yogī (yogārūḍha) → relies on śama (complete withdrawal from action) to maintain stable meditation.
   - Karmayoga is praised as a stepping stone. Initially, renunciation of fruit-desires while performing action helps stabilize the mind, making one fit for dhyāna. Eventually, when the mind is steady, further withdrawal from action (śama) is the key.

3. **Textual Integration:**
   - This continues the logic established in verses 1–2: mental renunciation of fruit-desires and the careful use of action prepare the ground for genuine meditation.
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes the ‘bahiraṅga’ (external) nature of karmayoga relative to dhyānayoga, illustrating a hierarchical approach: first stabilize the mind through selfless action, then immerse fully in meditation.

4. **Compound Analysis:**
   - **Ārurukṣu:** ā-roḍhu-m-icchu, ‘one who wishes to climb (to yoga).’
   - **Yogārūḍha:** yoga + ārūḍha, ‘one who has climbed or mounted onto yoga,’ indicating a stable presence in meditation.

## Philosophical Analysis

### Kantian Framework

- **Progressive Conditioning for Moral/Spiritual Ideal:**
  Like Kant, who posits that one must first become morally disciplined (acting from duty, not inclination) before attaining the highest moral good, the Gītā’s approach is gradual. One doesn’t jump straight into meditation but first performs action ethically and without fruit-desire. This resembles Kant’s insistence on internal moral purification before higher rational insight can be achieved.

### Fichtean Development

- **Dialectical Self-Overcoming:**
  Fichte’s view of the self’s moral elevation involves stages. Initially, the self engages with the world (karma) while purifying motives. As it progresses, it outgrows the need for external support (action) and enters into the pure inwardness of meditation. The I’s increasing independence from external conditions parallels the journey from karmayoga to dhyānayoga.

- **From External Means to Internal Freedom:**
  The shift from action-based means to tranquility aligns with Fichte’s idea that freedom grows as the self moves from the external realm of activity to the internal realm of pure thought.

### Hegelian Integration

- **Triadic Progression:**
  Hegel would see a triadic movement:
  - Thesis: The aspirant performing action without desire (karmayoga).
  - Antithesis: The advanced state where action is no longer needed (śama) because the yogi’s mind is stable.
  - Synthesis: A complete spiritual state where the practitioner transcends the duality of action and non-action, ultimately established in the Concept (yoga) itself.

- **Concrete Universality:**
  Eventually, the practitioner realizes that both karmayoga and renunciation of actions serve as stages. The universal truth—stable meditation—unfolds through these steps. This is the rational, developmental nature of spiritual progress that Hegel’s method appreciates.

## Systematic Integration

- **From Technical to Philosophical:**
  Technically, we learn that karmayoga is essential before attaining stable meditation. Philosophically, this resonates with a rational structure of moral and spiritual growth. The verse places emphasis on a natural progression: action → purifying mind → cessation of action → stable meditation.
  Each stage is conditionally necessary, reflecting Kant’s moral groundwork, Fichte’s self-overcoming, and Hegel’s dialectical movement.

- **Continuity and Development:**
  From verse 1 to 3, the Gītā delineates a path:
  - Verse 1: Even a householder performing dutiful action without fruit-desire is figuratively a renunciant.
  - Verse 2: Renunciation of fruit-desire (saṅkalpa) is crucial for becoming a yogi.
  - Verse 3: This karmayoga now serves as the initial cause (means) for one aspiring to meditation, eventually giving way to śama (complete quietude) once one is established.

This perfectly sets the stage for the forthcoming elaboration on dhyāna, illustrating how each stage logically and methodically leads to the next.

**In conclusion, Bhagavad Gītā 6.3 and Śaṅkarācārya’s commentary highlight karmayoga as the initial means for the aspiring yogi, preparing the mind for the eventual internalization and stillness of dhyāna. Philosophically, this structured progression aligns with Kant’s emphasis on moral preparation, Fichte’s dialectical self-transcendence, and Hegel’s triadic synthesis, showcasing a coherent, rational path of spiritual evolution.**
