## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
यः पूर्वजन्मनि कृतः अभ्यासः सः पूर्वाभ्यासः।
तेनैव बलवता ह्रियते संसिद्धौ हि यस्मात् अवशोऽपि सः योगभ्रष्टः।

न कृतं चेत् योगाभ्यासजात् संस्कारात् बलवत्तरम् अधर्मादिलक्षणं कर्म।
तदा योगाभ्यासजनितेन संस्कारेण ह्रियते।

अधर्मश्चेत् बलवत्तरः कृतः, तेन योगजोऽपि संस्कारः अभिभूयत एव।
तत्क्षये तु योगजः संस्कारः स्वयमेव कार्यमारभते।

न दीर्घकालस्थस्यापि विनाशः तस्य अस्ति इत्यर्थः।
अतः जिज्ञासुरपि योगस्य स्वरूपं ज्ञातुमिच्छन् अपि योगमार्गे प्रवृत्तः संन्यासी योगभ्रष्टः।

सामर्थ्यात् सोऽपि शब्दब्रह्म वेदोक्तकर्मानुष्ठानफलम् अतिवर्तते अतिक्रामति।
किमुत बुद्ध्वा यः योगं तन्निष्ठः अभ्यासं कुर्यात्॥ ४४॥

### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**Yaḥ pūrvajanmani kṛtaḥ abhyāsaḥ saḥ pūrvābhyāsaḥ।
Tenaiva balavatā hriyate saṃsiddhau hi yasmāt avaśo’pi saḥ yogabhraṣṭaḥ।

Na kṛtaṃ cet yogābhyāsajātaṃ saṃskārāt balavattaram adharmādilakṣaṇaṃ karma।
Tadā yogābhyāsajanitena saṃskāreṇa hriyate।

Adharmaś cet balavattaraḥ kṛtaḥ, tena yogajo’pi saṃskāraḥ abhibhūyata eva।
Tatkṣaye tu yogajaḥ saṃskāraḥ svayameva kāryam ārabhate।

Na dīrghakālasthasyāpi vināśaḥ tasya asti ity arthaḥ।
Ataḥ jijñāsur api yogasya svarūpaṃ jñātum icchan api yogamārge pravṛttaḥ saṃnyāsī yogabhraṣṭaḥ।

Sāmarthyāt saḥ api śabdabrahma vedoktakarmānuṣṭhānaphalam ativartate atikrāmati।
Kimuta buddhvā yaḥ yogaṃ tanniṣṭhaḥ abhyāsaṃ kuryāt॥ 44॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The practice (*abhyāsa*) performed in a previous birth is referred to as *pūrvābhyāsa*.
By the strong influence of this past practice (*tenaiva balavatā*), the individual is carried forward (*hriyate*),
even without their conscious effort (*avaśo’pi saḥ*), toward perfection (*saṃsiddhau*).

If actions contrary to yoga (*adharma*) are more powerful than the impressions of yogic practice (*yogābhyāsajātaṃ saṃskāram*),
then the yogic impressions are temporarily subdued (*abhibhūyata eva*).

However, when those contrary actions are exhausted, the yogic impressions naturally regain their influence (*svayameva kāryam ārabhate*),
ensuring that even after a long period, there is no destruction of the progress made (*na dīrghakālasthasyāpi vināśaḥ*).

Thus, even a seeker of yoga (*jijñāsur api yogasya*), desiring to understand its nature,
and embarking on the path of yoga, transcends (*ativartate*) the fruit of Vedic rites and rituals (*śabdabrahma vedoktakarmānuṣṭhānaphalam*).

What more can be said of one who fully comprehends yoga and dedicates themselves entirely to its practice (*kimuta buddhvā yaḥ yogaṃ tanniṣṭhaḥ abhyāsaṃ kuryāt*)?

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes how the force of past impressions propels the yogī forward, even unconsciously.
- **Second Clause:** Highlights the superiority of yoga over Vedic ritualistic practices.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Force of Past Impressions (पूर्वाभ्यास):**
   - Śaṅkara explains that *pūrvābhyāsa*, or past yogic practice, leaves strong impressions (*saṃskāra*), which guide the yogī even when they are unaware.
   - These impressions ensure continuity of effort, overcoming contrary tendencies when they subside.

2. **Temporary Obstruction (अधर्मादिलक्षणं कर्म):**
   - Actions opposed to yoga (*adharma*) may temporarily overpower the yogic impressions. However, they cannot destroy these impressions, which eventually reassert themselves.

3. **Transcendence of Vedic Rituals (शब्दब्रह्मातिवर्तते):**
   - Even a beginner seeking to understand yoga surpasses the results of Vedic rituals (*vedoktakarmānuṣṭhānaphalam*), emphasizing the spiritual supremacy of yoga.

4. **Inevitable Progress (न विनाशः तस्य):**
   - Śaṅkara assures that no yogic effort is ever wasted, as the accumulated impressions remain active across lifetimes, ensuring eventual progress.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Continuity Across Lifetimes:**
   - The verse highlights the cumulative nature of spiritual practice, showing how past efforts influence current progress.

2. **Superiority of Yoga:**
   - The transcendence of Vedic ritualistic results by yoga reinforces its role as a higher spiritual pursuit.

3. **Assurance for Seekers:**
   - Krishna’s teaching provides hope to seekers by affirming that even incomplete efforts lead to eventual spiritual success.

4. **Inevitable Liberation:**
   - The enduring power of yogic impressions suggests that liberation is inevitable for those who have begun the path, regardless of interruptions.
