## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
न अत्यश्नतः आत्मसंमितमन्नपरिमाणमतीत्याश्नतः अत्यश्नतः न योगः अस्ति।
न च एकान्तम् अनश्नतः योगः अस्ति।

‘यदु ह वा आत्मसंमितमन्नं तदवति तन्न हिनस्ति यद्भूयो हिनस्ति तद्यत् कनीयोऽन्नं न तदवति’ (श. ब्रा. ?) इति श्रुतेः।
तस्मात् योगी न आत्मसंमितात् अन्नात् अधिकं न्यूनं वा अश्नीयात्।

अथवा, योगिनः योगशास्त्रे परिपठीतात् अन्नपरिमाणात् अतिमात्रमश्नतः योगो नास्ति।
उक्तं हि—‘अर्धं सव्यञ्जनान्नस्य तृतीयमुदकस्य च।
वायोः सञ्चरणार्थं तु चतुर्थमवशेषयेत्’ ( ?) इत्यादिपरिमाणम्।

तथा—न च अतिस्वप्नशीलस्य योगो भवति नैव च अतिमात्रं जाग्रतो भवति च अर्जुन॥ १६॥

**Na atyaśnataḥ ātmāsaṃmitam annapari māṇam atītyāśnataḥ atyaśnataḥ na yogaḥ asti।
Na ca ekāntam anaśnataḥ yogaḥ asti।

‘Yadu ha vā ātmāsaṃmitam annaṃ tad avati tan na hinasti yad bhūyo hinasti tad yat kanīyo annaṃ na tad avati’ (Śa. Brā. ?) iti śruteḥ।
Tasmāt yogī na ātmāsaṃmitāt annāt adhikaṃ nyūnaṃ vā aśnīyāt।

Athavā, yoginaḥ yogāśāstre paripathitāt annapramāṇāt atimātram aśnataḥ yogaḥ na asti।
Uktaṃ hi—‘Ardhaṃ savyañjanānnasya tṛtīyam udakasya ca।
Vāyoḥ sañcaraṇārthaṃ tu caturtham avaśeṣayet’ ( ?) ityādipramāṇam।

Tathā—Na ca atisvapnaśīlasya yogaḥ bhavati naiva ca atimātraṃ jāgrato bhavati ca arjuna॥ 16॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
For one who eats excessively (*atyaśnataḥ*), transcending the appropriate amount of food for oneself (*ātmāsaṃmitam annaṃ*), yoga is not possible.
Nor is yoga possible for one who does not eat at all (*anaśnataḥ*).

This is supported by the scripture:
“One who eats food that is appropriate for oneself is protected by it and not harmed. But excessive food harms, and insufficient food does not sustain” (*Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*).
Thus, a yogī should neither eat more nor less than what is suitable for oneself (*ātmāsaṃmitam*).

Alternatively, the statement refers to exceeding or falling short of the food quantity specified in yoga texts. It is said:
“Half of the stomach should be filled with food along with accompaniments, one-third with water, and one-fourth left for air circulation.”

Similarly, yoga is not possible for one excessively given to sleep (*atisvapnaśīla*), nor for one who remains awake too much (*atimātraṃ jāgrataḥ*), O Arjuna.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Prohibits extreme eating habits (overeating or fasting).
- **Second Clause:** Warns against excessive sleeping or wakefulness.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Moderation in Eating (अत्यश्नतः, अनश्नतः):**
   - Śaṅkara highlights the importance of eating an appropriate amount (*ātmāsaṃmitam*), supported by scriptural authority.
   - Overeating harms the body, while insufficient food fails to sustain it, making both detrimental to yoga.

2. **Yoga Text Guidance:**
   - He refers to specific dietary proportions from yoga texts, recommending a balance between food, water, and air circulation to maintain physical and mental balance.

3. **Balance in Sleep and Wakefulness (अतिस्वप्नशीलस्य, जाग्रतः):**
   - Excessive sleep leads to lethargy, while too much wakefulness causes mental agitation.
   - Both are barriers to the calmness and focus required for yoga.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Moderation as a Principle:**
   - The verse underscores the broader Gītā theme of moderation (*yukta*), essential in all aspects of life for spiritual progress.

2. **Balance in Physical Needs:**
   - Śaṅkara integrates physiological practices like proper eating and sleeping into the discipline of yoga, showing their significance in achieving mental and spiritual stability.

3. **Practical Foundation for Yoga:**
