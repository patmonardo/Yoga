**Tatra yogināṃ kule taṃ buddhisaṃyogaṃ buddhyā saṃyogaṃ buddhisaṃyogaṃ labhate paurvadehikam।
Pūrvasmin dehe bhavaṃ paurvadehikam।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
In the family of yogīs (*yogināṃ kule*), one regains the connection with the intelligence (*buddhisaṃyogaṃ*),
specifically the connection established by efforts in their previous body (*paurvadehikam*).

This intelligence, originating from the impressions (*saṃskāra*) accumulated in their prior existence (*pūrvasmin dehe bhavam*),
guides them to continue their efforts (*yatate ca prayatnaṃ ca karoti*).

From this foundation, they strive even more vigorously (*tataḥ bhūyaḥ bahutaraṃ*)
towards achieving spiritual perfection (*saṃsiddhau*), O son of the Kurus (*he kurunandana*).
