आत्मौपम्येन आत्मा स्वयमेव उपमीयते अनया इत्युपमा।
तस्या उपमाया भावः औपम्यं तेन आत्मौपम्येन।

सर्वत्र सर्वभूतेषु समं तुल्यं पश्यति यः अर्जुन।
स च किं समं पश्यति इत्युच्यते—
यथा मम सुखम् इष्टं तथा सर्वप्राणिनां सुखम् अनुकूलम्।

न कस्यचित् प्रतिकूलमाचरति, अहिंसक इत्यर्थः।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The term *ātmaupamyena* means the comparison of others to oneself (*ātmā svayam eva upamīyate*).
Through this perspective (*aupamyaṃ*), one sees all beings equally (*sarvabhūteṣu samaṃ paśyati*), O Arjuna.

What does "seeing equally" mean? It is explained thus:
Just as my own happiness is dear and favorable (*mama sukham iṣṭaṃ anukūlam*),
so is the happiness of all beings dear and favorable to them.

Similarly, just as my own sorrow is unfavorable and undesirable (*mama duḥkhaṃ pratikūlam aniṣṭaṃ*),
so is the sorrow of all beings undesirable and unfavorable to them.

In this way, through self-comparison (*ātmaupamyena*), one sees the happiness and sorrow of all beings with equality (*tulyatā*),
and does not act in a way that is harmful to anyone (*na kasyacit pratikūlam ācarati*). This means being non-violent (*ahiṃsakaḥ*).

Such a yogī, who is firmly established in right understanding (*samyagdarśananiṣṭhaḥ*),
is considered supreme (*paramaḥ*), the highest among all yogīs (*sarvayogināṃ madhye*).
