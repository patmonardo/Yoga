### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Just as a lamp (*dīpaḥ*), when placed in a windless area (*nivātasthaḥ*), does not flicker (*na iṅgate*, does not move),
such is the analogy (*upamā*) used by those knowledgeable in yoga (*yogajñaiḥ*) and observers of the tendencies of the mind (*cittapracāradarśibhiḥ*).

This analogy describes the disciplined mind (*yatacittaḥ*) of a yogī,
one who has restrained the inner faculty (*saṃyatāntaḥkaraṇa*),
and is engaged in the practice of yoga (*yuñjataḥ yogam*), particularly in the absorption of the self (*samādhi*).

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Steadiness of the Lamp (दीपो निवातस्थो):**
   - A lamp placed in a windless location (*nivāta*) remains steady (*na iṅgate*), symbolizing the unmoving nature of a focused mind.
   - The absence of external disturbances (wind) parallels the withdrawal from sensory distractions.

2. **Disciplined Mind (यतचित्तस्य):**
   - *Yatacittaḥ* refers to a yogī whose mind and inner faculties (*antaḥkaraṇa*) are fully restrained and directed inward.
   - This steadiness is achieved through disciplined practice and self-control.

3. **Practice of Self-Absorption (योगम् आत्मनः युञ्जतः):**
   - The yogī’s mind is described as engaged in the practice of self-absorption (*samādhi*), where external distractions are eliminated, and inner focus is perfected.

4. **Yoga Experts’ Analogy (योगज्ञैः उपमा):**

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Steadiness as the Goal:**
   - The verse illustrates that steadiness of the mind is the hallmark of advanced yoga practice, reflecting inner equilibrium and focus.

2. **Union of Mind and Self:**

3. **Freedom from Distractions:**
   - Like the lamp unaffected by wind, the yogī’s mind remains undisturbed by external sensory inputs or internal agitation, symbolizing liberation from dualities.
