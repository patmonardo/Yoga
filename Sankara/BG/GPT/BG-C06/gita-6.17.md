### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
For one who is moderate in eating (*āhāraḥ*—food intake) and recreation (*vihāraḥ*—movement, including walking or physical activity),
these two being measured and regulated (*niyataparimāṇau*), that person is described as *yuktāhāravihāraḥ*.

Similarly, one who is balanced in their actions (*yuktaceṣṭaḥ*), whose activities in work or duty (*karmasu*) are regulated, is considered disciplined.

Likewise, one who is moderate in sleep (*svapna*) and wakefulness (*avabodha*), maintaining these at proper times (*niyatakālau*), is described as *yuktasvapnāvabodhaḥ*.

For such a yogī, yoga becomes a destroyer of all suffering (*duḥkhahā*).
This means that yoga eliminates all forms of misery and acts as the remover of all worldly suffering (*saṃsāraduḥkha*).

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes the yogī’s moderation in food, recreation, actions, sleep, and wakefulness.
- **Second Clause:** States the outcome—yoga destroys all suffering.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Moderation in Eating and Recreation (युक्ताहारविहार):**
   - *Āhāra* refers to food intake, while *vihāra* refers to physical activities, including walking. Both should be measured and regulated for a yogī.

2. **Balance in Actions (युक्तचेष्ट):**
   - Actions performed as part of one’s duties (*karmasu*) should be moderate and disciplined, avoiding extremes.

3. **Regulation of Sleep and Wakefulness (युक्तस्वप्नावबोध):**
   - *Svapna* (sleep) and *avabodha* (wakefulness) must be balanced in terms of timing and duration to maintain physical and mental equilibrium.

4. **Yoga as the Destroyer of Suffering (दुःखहा):**
   - Śaṅkara explains *duḥkhahā* as yoga’s ability to eliminate all types of suffering, particularly the miseries associated with worldly existence (*saṃsāraduḥkha*).

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Harmony in Daily Life:**
   - The verse highlights the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of daily life, emphasizing their role in spiritual progress.

2. **Yoga as Liberation from Suffering:**
   - Yoga is presented not only as a practice for inner peace but also as a means of overcoming the inherent sufferings of existence.

3. **Integration of Physical and Mental Discipline:**
   - The alignment of physical actions (e.g., eating, sleeping) with mental control (e.g., wakefulness) creates the foundation for effective yoga practice.
