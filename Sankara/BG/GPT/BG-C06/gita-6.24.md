### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The desires (*kāmāḥ*) that arise from mental deliberation (*saṅkalpaḥ*),
that is, those desires whose origin is deliberation (*saṅkalpaprabhavāḥ*), must be abandoned (*tyaktvā*).
One should give them up entirely (*sarvān aśeṣataḥ*), without any attachment (*nirlepena*).

Furthermore, through the mind endowed with discernment (*vivekayuktena manasā*),
one should restrain (*viniyamya*) the collection of senses (*indriyagrāmam*),
controlling them completely from all sides (*samantataḥ samantāt*).

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Calls for the complete abandonment of desires that originate from mental deliberation.
- **Second Clause:** Emphasizes the need to control the senses comprehensively using the mind.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Origin of Desires (सङ्कल्पप्रभवान्):**
   - *Saṅkalpa* refers to the process of mental imagination or deliberation.
   - Desires (*kāmāḥ*) are seen as products of such mental activities, making them a construct of the mind rather than inherent truths.
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes that these desires must be abandoned entirely (*aśeṣataḥ*).

2. **Detachment from Desires (त्यक्त्वा सर्वान् अशेषतः):**
   - The renunciation should be complete and free from residual attachment (*nirlepena*), highlighting the need for total inner freedom.

3. **Control of the Senses (मनसैव इन्द्रियग्रामम् विनियम्य):**
   - The senses (*indriyagrāmam*), collectively representing sensory interactions, must be restrained (*viniyamya*) using the mind (*manasā*).
   - The mind must be equipped with discernment (*vivekayuktam*) to effectively exercise this control.

4. **Comprehensive Restraint (समन्ततः):**
   - The restraint should be thorough and all-encompassing (*samantataḥ*), ensuring that the senses do not stray in any direction.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Desires as Mental Constructs:**
   - Desires are depicted as arising from the mind’s activity rather than from external reality, underscoring their impermanent and constructed nature.

2. **Role of Discernment:**
   - The mind’s capacity for discernment (*viveka*) is crucial in achieving control over sensory inputs and directing them inward.

3. **Complete Renunciation and Restraint:**
   - The verse emphasizes not partial but complete renunciation of desires and a comprehensive mastery over the senses as essential steps in the path of yoga.
