### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The one who worships Me (*māṃ bhajati*), the Lord abiding in all beings (*sarvabhūtasthitaṃ*),
and who is established in oneness (*ekatvam āsthitaḥ*), perceiving Me as the self (*ātmatattva*),

though engaged in various ways of life (*sarvathā sarvaprakāraiḥ vartamānaḥ*),
that yogī, with right knowledge (*samyagdarśī*), always dwells in Me (*mayi vartate*), in the supreme Vaiṣṇava state (*vaiṣṇave parame pade*).

Such a person is eternally liberated (*nityamukta eva*), and nothing can obstruct their path to liberation (*na mokṣaṃ prati kenacit pratibadhyate*).

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes the worship of the Lord abiding in all beings and the establishment in oneness.
- **Second Clause:** Highlights the yogī’s freedom and eternal dwelling in the Supreme, irrespective of their worldly actions.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Worship of the Universal Lord (सर्वभूतस्थितं मां भजति):**
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes that true worship (*bhajati*) is recognizing the Lord as abiding in all beings (*sarvabhūtasthitaṃ*).
   - This recognition arises from perceiving the self as non-different from the Supreme.

2. **Oneness (एकत्वमास्थितः):**
   - The yogī is described as established in oneness (*ekatva*), realizing the identity of the self with the Supreme (*ātmatattvena sthitaḥ*).
   - This oneness eliminates all distinctions and dualities.

3. **Unobstructed Liberation (नित्यमुक्त):**
   - The yogī is eternally free (*nityamukta*), beyond the bounds of worldly activities and conditions.
   - Śaṅkara affirms that no action or circumstance can hinder their liberation (*na mokṣaṃ prati kenacit pratibadhyate*).

4. **Dwelling in the Supreme (मयि वर्तते):**
   - The yogī always dwells in the Supreme (*mayi vartate*), regardless of their external life circumstances (*sarvathā vartamānaḥ*).
   - This reflects the transcendental state where worldly activities no longer affect the yogī’s realization.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Unity in Diversity:**
   - The verse underscores the vision of unity where the Lord is seen in all beings, and all beings are seen as one with the Lord.

2. **Liberation Beyond Actions:**
   - True liberation (*mokṣa*) is depicted as independent of one’s actions or lifestyle, arising solely from the realization of oneness.

3. **Yoga as Eternal Freedom:**
   - Śaṅkara interprets yoga as the state of eternal freedom (*nityamukti*), achieved through knowledge and the direct perception of the self’s unity with Brahman.
