### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
On that seat (*tatra*), having sat down, one should engage in yoga (*yogaṃ yuñjyāt*).

How? By withdrawing (*upasaṃhṛtya*) the mind from all external objects (*sarvaviṣayebhyaḥ*) and focusing it (*ekāgraṃ manaḥ kṛtvā*).

Additionally, one should restrain the activities of the mind and senses (*yatacittendriyakriyaḥ*). The term refers to someone whose mind (*citta*) and senses (*indriyāṇi*), as well as their activities (*kriyāḥ*), are brought under control.

Why should one engage in yoga? The verse explains: for the purification of the inner self (*ātmaviśuddhaye*), which refers to the cleansing of the inner faculty (*antaḥkaraṇa*).
