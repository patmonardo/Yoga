### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**Sarvabhūtasthaṃ sarveṣu bhūteṣu sthitaṃ svam ātmānaṃ।
Sarvabhūtāni ca ātmani brahmādīni stambaparyantāni ca sarvabhūtāni ātmani ekatāṃ gatāni।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The self, abiding in all beings (*sarvabhūtastham ātmānaṃ*),
and all beings (*sarvabhūtāni*), from Brahmā to a blade of grass (*brahmādīni stambaparyantāni*),
united in the self (*ātmani ekatāṃ gatāni*), is seen (*īkṣate*) by the yogī.

Such a yogī, whose mind is harmonized (*samāhitāntaḥkaraṇaḥ*), perceives equally everywhere (*sarvatra samadarśanaḥ*).

This equal vision (*samadṛṣṭi*) reflects the knowledge (*jñānaṃ*) of the oneness of Brahman and the self (*brahmātmaikatva*),
where all beings, despite their differences (*viṣameṣu sarvabhūteṣu*), are seen as one and the same.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Self in All Beings (सर्वभूतस्थम् आत्मानम्):**
   - The self is recognized as abiding within all beings, representing the immanence of the self.
   - This realization breaks down the apparent distinctions between individual entities.

2. **All Beings in the Self (सर्वभूतानि च आत्मनि):**
   - All beings, from the highest (*Brahmā*) to the lowest (*a blade of grass*), are seen as united in the self.

   - This vision is rooted in the knowledge of non-duality (*brahmātmaikatva*).

4. **Harmonized Mind (योगयुक्तात्मा):**
   - The yogī’s ability to see oneness arises from a stable and focused mind, achieved through disciplined yoga practice.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Unity in Diversity:**
   - The verse underscores the non-dual vision where distinctions among beings are dissolved in the realization of oneness.

2. **Yoga as a Means to Realization:**

3. **Equality as a Spiritual Perspective:**
   - The verse elevates equality (*samadṛṣṭi*) from a moral principle to a spiritual realization, arising from the knowledge of the self.
