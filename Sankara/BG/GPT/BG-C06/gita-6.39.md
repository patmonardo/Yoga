### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
This doubt of mine (*etat me saṃśayaṃ*), O Krishna (*kṛṣṇa*),
You alone are fit to remove (*chettum arhasi*) completely (*aśeṣataḥ*).

No one other than You (*tvadanyaḥ*), whether a sage (*ṛṣiḥ*) or a celestial being (*devaḥ*),
is capable of dispelling (*chettā nāśayitā*) this doubt (*saṃśayasya asya*).

For it is impossible (*na upapadyate*) for anyone else to resolve it.
Therefore, You alone are fit to remove it (*tvam eva chettum arhasi*), this is my request.
