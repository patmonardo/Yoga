**Yato yataḥ yasmād yasmāt nimittāt śabdādeḥ niścarati nirgacchati svabhāvadoṣāt manaḥ।

Tat-tan-nimittaṃ yāthātmya-nirūpaṇena ābhāsīkṛtya vairāgya-bhāvanayā ca।

Etat manaḥ ātmany eva vaśaṃ nayet ātmavaśyatām āpādayet।
Evaṃ yogābhyāsabalāt yoginaḥ ātmany eva praśāmyati manaḥ॥ 26॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Wherever (*yato yataḥ*) and for whatever reason (*nimittāt*), such as the perception of sound or other objects (*śabdādeḥ*),
the mind (*manaḥ*), due to its inherent restlessness (*svabhāvadoṣāt*), wanders outward (*niścarati nirgacchati*),
being exceedingly unsteady (*cañcalam atyarthaṃ calam*) and unstable (*asthiram*),

from there (*tatas tataḥ*), bring it back (*niyamya*) by understanding the true nature (*yāthātmya-nirūpaṇa*) of that distracting cause and nullifying its apparent importance (*ābhāsīkṛtya*) through cultivating detachment (*vairāgya-bhāvanayā*).

This mind (*etat manaḥ*) should then be directed and controlled (*vaśaṃ nayet*) within the self (*ātmany eva*),
bringing it under the sway of the self (*ātmavaśyatām āpādayet*).

In this way, through the strength of persistent yoga practice (*yogābhyāsabalāt*),
the mind of the yogī becomes fully pacified (*praśāmyati*) within the self alone.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes the inherent tendency of the restless mind to wander.
- **Second Clause:** Prescribes a disciplined approach to redirect and control the mind within the self.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Restlessness of the Mind (चञ्चलम्, अस्थिरम्):**
   - The mind is described as exceedingly restless (*atyarthaṃ calam*) and unstable (*asthiram*), naturally inclined to wander due to its inherent nature (*svabhāvadoṣa*).

2. **Sources of Distraction (शब्दादेः):**
   - External objects like sound (*śabda*) and other sensory inputs serve as stimuli that draw the mind outward (*niścarati*).

3. **Method of Control (नियम्य, वशं नयेत्):**
   - The mind should be redirected and controlled through two key methods:
     - **True Understanding (*yāthātmya-nirūpaṇa*):** Perceiving the actual nature of the distracting cause and recognizing its lack of real significance (*ābhāsīkṛtya*).
     - **Detachment (*vairāgya-bhāvanā*):** Cultivating a mindset of non-attachment to the external stimuli.

4. **Pacification in the Self (आत्मन्येव प्रशाम्यति):**
   - Through consistent practice (*yogābhyāsabalāt*), the mind becomes steady and fully pacified within the self (*ātmany eva*), achieving inner stability.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Self as the Anchor:**
   - The verse emphasizes that the ultimate resting place of the mind is the self, where it finds stability and peace.

2. **Active Discipline in Yoga:**
   - The process of controlling the mind is not passive; it requires active engagement through understanding and detachment.

3. **Role of Practice (योगाभ्यास):**
   - Persistent practice of yoga strengthens the ability to bring the mind back to the self, highlighting the importance of discipline and repetition.
