### Transliteration (Śaṅkara Commentary)
**Yatra yasmin kāle uparamate cittam uparatiṃ gacchati,
niruddhaṃ sarvato nivāritapracāraṃ yogasevayā yogānuṣṭhānena।

Yatra caiva yasmiṃś ca kāle ātmanā samādhipariśuddhena antaḥkaraṇena
ātmānaṃ paraṃ caitanyaṃ jyotiḥsvarūpaṃ paśyan upalabhamānaḥ
sve eva ātmani tuṣyati tuṣṭiṃ bhajate॥ 20॥**

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
At that time (*yatra yasmin kāle*), the mind becomes still (*uparamate*),
ceasing its activity entirely (*sarvato nivāritapracāraṃ*), restrained by the disciplined practice of yoga (*yogasevayā*).

At that same time, through the purified inner faculty (*samādhipariśuddhena antaḥkaraṇena*),
one perceives (*paśyan*) the self (*ātmānaṃ*) as the supreme consciousness (*paraṃ caitanyaṃ*), the essence of light (*jyotiḥsvarūpaṃ*).

Finding satisfaction within one’s own self (*sve eva ātmani*), the yogī attains contentment (*tuṣṭiṃ bhajate*).

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes the stillness of the mind achieved through disciplined yoga practice.
- **Second Clause:** Highlights self-realization and contentment as outcomes of this practice.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Stillness of the Mind (उपरमते चित्तम्):**
   - *Uparamate* signifies the cessation of mental activity and distractions, achieved by restraining the mind (*niruddhaṃ*) through the continuous practice of yoga (*yogasevayā*).
   - This state reflects complete mental discipline and inward focus.

2. **Perception of the Self (आत्मना आत्मानं पश्यन्):**
   - With a purified inner faculty (*samādhipariśuddhena antaḥkaraṇena*), the yogī perceives the self (*ātmā*).
   - The self is described as *paraṃ caitanyaṃ* (supreme consciousness) and *jyotiḥsvarūpaṃ* (the essence of light), indicating its transcendental nature.

3. **Contentment Within the Self (आत्मनि तुष्यति):**
   - Satisfaction (*tuṣṭiṃ*) arises from the realization of the self, independent of external circumstances.
   - The yogī finds complete fulfillment within their own self (*sve eva ātmani*).

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Yoga as a Path to Self-Realization:**
   - The verse underscores yoga’s role in achieving mental stillness and clarity, essential for perceiving the true nature of the self.

2. **Self-Sufficiency in Contentment:**
   - True contentment is portrayed as an internal state, arising from self-realization rather than external achievements or possessions.

3. **The Self as Supreme Consciousness:**
   - Śaṅkara’s description of the self as *paraṃ caitanyaṃ* and *jyotiḥsvarūpaṃ* aligns with Advaita Vedānta’s emphasis on the self as the ultimate, undivided reality.
