## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
सुखम् आत्यन्तिकं अत्यन्तमेव भवति इत्यात्यन्तिकम् अनन्तमित्यर्थः।
यत् तत् बुद्धिग्राह्यं बुद्ध्यैव इन्द्रियनिरपेक्षया गृह्यते इति बुद्धिग्राह्यम्।

अतीन्द्रियम् इन्द्रियगोचरातीतम् अविषयजनितमित्यर्थः।
वेत्ति तत् ईदृशं सुखम् अनुभवति यत्र यस्मिन् काले।

न च एव अयं विद्वान् आत्मस्वरूपे स्थितः तस्मात् नैव चलति तत्त्वतः।
तत्त्वस्वरूपात् न प्रच्यवते इत्यर्थः॥ २१॥

Na ca eva ayaṃ vidvān ātmasvarūpe sthitaḥ tasmāt naiva calati tattvataḥ।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The bliss described here is *ātyantikaṃ*—ultimate, infinite (*anantam*), and beyond measure.
It is called *buddhigrāhyam* because it is perceived only by the intellect (*buddhi*), independent of the senses (*indriyanirapekṣa*).

This bliss is *atīndriyam*, meaning it transcends the realm of the senses and is not caused by sensory objects (*aviṣayajanitam*).
This ultimate bliss is experienced (*vetti*) at that time (*yatra yasmin kāle*).

Furthermore, the one who experiences this bliss, being established in the true nature of the self (*ātmasvarūpe sthitaḥ*),
does not move away (*na calati*) from the truth (*tattvataḥ*).
This means they remain unwavering in the ultimate reality (*tattvasvarūpāt na pracyavate*).
