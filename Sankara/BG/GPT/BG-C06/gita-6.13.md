## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
बाह्यमासनमुक्तम्; अधुना शरीरधारणं कथम् इत्युच्यते—

समं कायशिरोग्रीवं कायश्च शिरश्च ग्रीवा च कायशिरोग्रीवं तत् समं धारयन् अचलं च।
समं धारयतः चलनं सम्भवति; अतः विशिनष्टि—अचलमिति। स्थिरः स्थिरो भूत्वा इत्यर्थः।
स्वं नासिकाग्रं सम्प्रेक्ष्य सम्यक् प्रेक्षणं दर्शनं कृत्वेव इति। इवशब्दो लुप्तो द्रष्टव्यः।
न हि स्वनासिकाग्रसम्प्रेक्षणमिह विधित्सितम्। किं तर्हि? चक्षुषो दृष्टिसंनिपातः।
स च अन्तःकरणसमाधानापेक्षो विवक्षितः।
स्वनासिकाग्रसम्प्रेक्षणमेव चेत् विवक्षितम्, मनः तत्रैव समाधीयेत, नात्मनि।
आत्मनि हि मनसः समाधानं वक्ष्यति ‘आत्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा’ (भ. गी. ६.२५) इति।
तस्मात् इवशब्दलोपेन अक्ष्णोः दृष्टिसंनिपात एव ‘सम्प्रेक्ष्य’ इत्युच्यते।
दिशश्च अनवलोकयन् दिशां च अवलोकनम् अन्तराकुर्वन् इत्येतत्॥ १३॥

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The external aspect of posture (*āsana*) has already been mentioned. Now, how to hold the body is explained:

Holding the body (*kāya*), head (*śiras*), and neck (*grīva*) straight and aligned (*samaṃ*),
one should keep them steady (*acalaṃ*), without movement. The term *acalaṃ* clarifies that even while holding the body straight, movement might occur, so steadiness is emphasized.

One should remain firm (*sthiraḥ*), meaning stable in this position.

One should gaze at the tip of one’s own nose (*nāsikāgraṃ samprekṣya*), which means fixing one’s sight appropriately.
The term *iva* (as if) is implied here, indicating that literal gazing at the nose-tip is not the intended meaning.

What is intended instead? It is the convergence of vision (*cakṣuṣaḥ dṛṣṭisaṃnipātaḥ*), which is aimed at focusing the mind.

If literal gazing at the nose-tip were intended, the mind would remain fixed only there, not within the self. However, the focus of the mind is to be established in the self, as will be stated later:
“Having fixed the mind in the self” (*ātmasaṃsthaṃ manaḥ kṛtvā*, Gītā 6.25).

Therefore, the term *samprekṣya* refers to the convergence of vision (*dṛṣṭisaṃnipātaḥ*), without external distractions.

One should not glance around in other directions (*diśaś ca anavalokayan*), meaning that one avoids turning the gaze outward.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Provides instructions on maintaining physical posture (body, head, and neck alignment).
- **Second Clause:** Describes gaze control and avoiding distractions from external directions.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Alignment and Steadiness (समं अचलम्):**
   - Proper posture includes straight alignment of the body, head, and neck (*kāyaśirogrīvaṃ*).
   - Steadiness (*acalaṃ*) is emphasized to prevent movement that disrupts concentration.

2. **Gaze Control (नासिकाग्रं सम्प्रेक्ष्य):**
   - Literal fixation on the nose-tip is not intended. Instead, *samprekṣya* refers to the convergence of sight (*cakṣuṣaḥ dṛṣṭisaṃnipātaḥ*), aiding internal focus.
   - This convergence supports the mind’s withdrawal from external distractions and alignment with the self.

3. **Avoidance of Distractions (दिशश्च अनवलोकयन्):**
   - Śaṅkara highlights that turning the gaze to various directions creates interruptions. Focusing vision inward aligns with the goal of mental concentration.

4. **Mind Focus:**
   - The ultimate aim is to focus the mind within the self, as clarified by the future instruction (*ātmasaṃsthaṃ manaḥ kṛtvā*).
   - Vision convergence is a means to support inner mental stability.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Integration of Body and Mind:**
   - Physical alignment and steadiness directly support mental concentration, reflecting the unity of physical and spiritual practices in yoga.

2. **Inner Focus Over External Gazing:**
   - The commentary clarifies that external techniques like gazing at the nose-tip are symbolic aids for internal mental alignment.

3. **Discipline in Practice:**
   - Avoiding distractions and maintaining a steady gaze are disciplines that support the larger goal of self-purification and realization.
