Svātmā hi nāma ātmanaḥ priya eva bhavati।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The one who sees Me, Vāsudeva, as the self of all (*sarvasya ātmānaṃ*),
and who sees everything—from Brahmā to the smallest beings (*brahmādibhūtajātaṃ*)—as abiding in Me (*mayi sarvātmani*),

for such a person, who sees the oneness of the self in all (*ātmaikatvadarśī*), I, the Lord (*īśvaraḥ*), am never lost (*na praṇaśyāmi*).
I will never become distant or removed (*na parokṣatāṃ gamiṣyāmi*).

Likewise, such a person is never lost to Me (*sa ca me na praṇaśyati*),
for that individual, who knows Me as Vāsudeva, remains always present (*na parokṣo bhavati*).

This is due to the mutual oneness (*ekātmatva*) between us,
for the self is always dear to the self (*svātmā ātmanaḥ priyaḥ*).
Since I am the one who perceives this unity of all selves, I am ever united with that individual.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes the realization of seeing the Lord everywhere and seeing all things as abiding in Him.
- **Second Clause:** Highlights the mutual unity between such a person and the Lord, where neither is ever distant or lost to the other.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Seeing the Lord Everywhere (यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र):**
   - Śaṅkara explains that seeing Vāsudeva as the self of all beings (*sarvasya ātmānaṃ*) is the highest realization.
   - This perception transcends individual distinctions, recognizing the divine presence in all forms.

2. **Seeing Everything in the Lord (सर्वं च मयि पश्यति):**
   - The yogī sees all entities, from the highest (*Brahmā*) to the smallest beings (*stambaparyantāni*), as existing in the Lord (*mayi sarvātmani*).
   - This reflects the non-dual understanding that all existence is ultimately one.

3. **Mutual Unity (तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि):**
   - The Lord declares that He is never lost (*na praṇaśyāmi*) to one who sees this unity, emphasizing the intimacy and immediacy of this relationship.
   - Similarly, the yogī remains ever-present (*na praṇaśyati*) to the Lord due to their shared essence (*ekātmatva*).

4. **Love for the Self (स्वात्मा प्रियः):**
   - The self is inherently dear to the self, and recognizing the Lord as the self of all beings establishes an unbreakable connection.
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes that this connection arises from the yogī’s realization of the oneness of all selves in the ultimate reality.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Unity of Existence:**
   - The verse emphasizes the non-dual vision where the individual self, all beings, and the Lord are recognized as one.

2. **Mutual Presence in Realization:**
   - The realization of oneness ensures that neither the Lord nor the individual is ever distant or separate, reflecting the intimacy of divine unity.

3. **Yoga as Oneness:**
   - The ultimate fruit of yoga is the dissolution of distinctions, where the self is seen as both immanent in all and transcendent.
