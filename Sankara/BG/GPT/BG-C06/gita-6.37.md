### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The one who is undisciplined (*ayatiḥ*), lacking sufficient effort in the path of yoga (*aprayatnavān yogamārge*),
yet endowed with faith (*śraddhayā āstikyabuddhyā ca upetaḥ*), whose mind (*manas*) wanders away from yoga (*calitaṃ mānasaṃ*), especially at the time of death (*antakāle*),

and who, having lost focus (*bhraṣṭasmṛtiḥ*),
fails to attain perfection in yoga (*aprāpya yogasaṃsiddhiṃ*),
which is the fruit of yoga (*yogaphalaṃ*)—right knowledge or direct realization (*samyagdarśanaṃ*).

What destination (*kāṃ gatiṃ*) does such a person attain, O Krishna (*he kṛṣṇa gacchati*)?

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Describes the situation of a yogī who lacks sufficient effort yet has faith and loses focus during yoga practice.
- **Second Clause:** Raises the concern of what happens to such a person who fails to achieve the goal of yoga.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Undisciplined Effort (अयतिः):**
   - *Ayatiḥ* refers to one who has not applied consistent effort (*aprayatnavān*) in yoga practice, indicating a lack of perseverance.

2. **Faith Despite Lack of Discipline (श्रद्धयोपेतः):**
   - The person is described as having faith (*śraddhayā*), implying belief in the teachings of yoga and its goals, despite their insufficient effort.

3. **Mind Wandering (चलितमानसः):**
   - *Calitamānasaḥ* refers to a mind that strays from the path of yoga, especially at critical moments like death (*antakāle*).
   - This wandering indicates a loss of focus and a failure to remain steadfast.

4. **Failure to Achieve Perfection (अप्राप्य योगसंसिद्धिं):**
   - The individual is said to have not attained yoga’s ultimate goal (*yogasaṃsiddhiṃ*), which is direct realization (*samyagdarśanaṃ*).
   - This raises the concern about their spiritual progress and ultimate destination (*kāṃ gatiṃ*).

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Concern for Partial Efforts:**
   - Arjuna’s question reflects a common concern about what happens to spiritual seekers who make partial progress but fail to achieve their goal.

2. **Importance of Perseverance:**
   - The verse underscores the need for disciplined effort (*yatna*) in yoga to avoid such an outcome.

3. **Role of Divine Guidance:**
   - By addressing Krishna, Arjuna seeks assurance that such individuals are not abandoned and their efforts are not wasted.

4. **Continuity of Effort:**
   - The question anticipates Krishna’s response, which will affirm that spiritual progress is never lost and continues across lifetimes.
