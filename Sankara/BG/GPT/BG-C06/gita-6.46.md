### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
The yogī is superior to ascetics (*tapasvibhyaḥ adhikaḥ yogī*).
Even to those possessing knowledge (*jñānibhyaḥ*), which here refers to proficiency in scriptural understanding (*śāstrārthapāṇḍityam*),
the yogī is considered greater (*mataḥ adhikaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ*).

Furthermore, the yogī is superior to performers of ritualistic actions (*karmibhyaḥ*), such as those engaged in sacrifices like *agnihotra*.
For this reason (*yasmāt*), O Arjuna, be a yogī (*tasmāt yogī bhava arjuna*).
