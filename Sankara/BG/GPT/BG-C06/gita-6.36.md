**Asaṃyatātmanā abhyāsavairāgyābhyām asaṃyataḥ ātmā antaḥkaraṇaṃ yasya saḥ ayam asaṃyatātmā।
Tena asaṃyatātmanā yogo duṣprāpaḥ duḥkhena prāpyata iti me matiḥ।

Yas tu punaḥ vaśyātmā abhyāsavairāgyābhyāṃ vaśyatvam āpāditaḥ ātmā manaḥ yasya saḥ ayam vaśyātmā।
Tena vaśyātmanā tu yatatā bhūyo’pi prayatnaṃ kurvatā śakyaḥ avāptuṃ yogaḥ।

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
For one whose mind (*ātmā*) is unrestrained (*asaṃyata*),
meaning one whose inner organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*) is uncontrolled due to the absence of practice and detachment (*abhyāsavairāgyābhyām asaṃyataḥ*),
yoga is difficult to attain (*yogo duṣprāpaḥ*). This is my considered opinion (*me matiḥ*).

However, one whose mind (*ātmā*) is disciplined (*vaśyātmā*),
meaning one who has brought the mind under control through practice and detachment (*abhyāsavairāgyābhyām vaśyatvam āpāditaḥ*),
can, through earnest effort (*yatatā bhūyo’pi prayatnaṃ kurvatā*),
achieve yoga (*yogaḥ śakyaḥ avāptuṃ*), using the prescribed means (*yathokta upāyāt*).

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Unrestrained Mind (असंयतात्मा):**
   - The *asaṃyatātmā* is one whose inner organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*) lacks control due to neglecting the essential disciplines of practice (*abhyāsa*) and detachment (*vairāgya*).

2. **Disciplined Mind (वश्यात्मा):**
   - The *vaśyātmā* refers to one whose mind has been brought under control through consistent practice and detachment.

3. **Role of Effort (यतता):**
   - Even for a disciplined mind, success in yoga requires continued effort (*prayatnaṃ kurvatā*).
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes that control over the mind is a dynamic process, demanding sustained diligence.

4. **Prescribed Means (उपाय):**
   - The *yathokta upāya* refers to the methods outlined in the Gītā, namely the practices of abhyāsa (practice) and vairāgya (detachment).
   - Adhering to these means ensures progress in yoga.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Control as a Prerequisite for Yoga:**
   - The verse underscores the necessity of mental discipline as the foundation for successful yoga practice.

2. **Balance of Effort and Method:**
