### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Undoubtedly (*asaṃśayaṃ*), O mighty-armed Arjuna (*mahābāho*), the mind is restless (*calaṃ cañcalaṃ*)
and difficult to restrain (*durnigraham*).

However, through repeated practice (*abhyāsena*), which involves sustained meditation (*satatamananāśīlatā*),
and detachment (*vairāgyeṇa*), characterized by a lack of attachment to sense objects (*viṣayeṣu anabhisvaṅgabhāva*),
it can indeed be controlled (*gṛhyate*).

This means the mind can be disciplined and restrained (*saṃyamyata*).

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Acknowledges the challenges posed by the mind’s restless and uncontrollable nature.
- **Second Clause:** Offers a solution through consistent practice and detachment.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Restless Nature of the Mind (दुर्निग्रहं चलम्):**
   - Krishna agrees with Arjuna’s observation that the mind is inherently restless (*cañcalaṃ*) and difficult to restrain (*durnigraham*).
   - This acknowledgment validates the challenge of mental discipline faced by practitioners.

2. **Solution Through Practice (अभ्यासेन):**
   - *Abhyāsa* refers to consistent meditation and mental focus.
   - Śaṅkara interprets this as the cultivation of *satatamananāśīlatā*—sustained mindfulness and contemplation.

3. **Detachment (वैराग्येण):**
   - *Vairāgya* signifies non-attachment to sense objects and desires (*viṣayeṣu anabhisvaṅga*).
   - Detachment helps in weakening the mind’s tendency to seek external stimulation, aiding in its restraint.

4. **Combination of Practice and Detachment:**
   - The interplay of consistent effort and detachment forms the dual approach to controlling the mind.
   - Practice trains the mind to focus, while detachment reduces distractions and dependencies.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Acknowledgment of Challenges:**
   - Krishna’s agreement reflects the Gītā’s practical approach, recognizing human struggles in the spiritual journey.

2. **Mind Control as a Discipline:**
   - The verse highlights that mental discipline requires both effort and dispassion, not just theoretical understanding.

3. **Yoga as a Path of Balance:**
   - By combining practice and detachment, the verse emphasizes the balanced approach essential in yoga.
