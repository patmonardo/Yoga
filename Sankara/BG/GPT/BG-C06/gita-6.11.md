## Śaṅkara’s Commentary
### Sanskrit Commentary
अथेदानीं योगं युञ्जतः आसनाहारविहारादीनां योगसाधनत्वेन नियमो वक्तव्यः,
प्राप्तयोगस्य लक्षणं तत्फलादि च, इत्यत आरभ्यते। तत्र आसनमेव तावत् प्रथमम् उच्यते—

शुचौ शुद्धे विविक्ते स्वभावतः संस्कारतो वा,
देशे स्थाने प्रतिष्ठाप्य स्थिरम् अचलम् आत्मनः आसनं नात्युच्छ्रितं नातीव उच्छ्रितं न अपि अतिनीचम्,
तच्च चैलाजिनकुशोत्तरं चैलम् अजिनं कुशाश्च उत्तरे यस्मिन् आसने तत् आसनं चैलाजिनकुशोत्तरम्।
पाठक्रमाद्विपरीतः अत्र क्रमः चैलादीनाम्॥ ११॥

### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
Now, for one practicing yoga, the regulation of aids such as posture (*āsana*), diet (*āhāra*), and recreation (*vihāra*) must be specified as essential for yoga practice.
The characteristics, results, and related aspects of attaining yoga are to be discussed starting here.

Among these, posture is mentioned first:
In a clean (*śucau*) and pure place, whether naturally or by preparation,
one should establish a firm (*sthiram*) and steady (*acalam*) seat (*āsana*) for oneself.

The seat should neither be too high (*nātyucchritaṃ*), nor too low (*natinīcaṃ*),
and it should be covered with cloth (*caila*), deer skin (*ajina*), and kuśa grass (*kuśa*).

The arrangement of *caila*, *ajina*, and *kuśa* is mentioned in reverse order compared to some scriptural references, but their combination is necessary for the seat.

## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Specifies the prerequisites for a proper seat, emphasizing purity and stability.
- **Second Clause:** Describes the materials and height of the seat, ensuring practicality and suitability for meditation.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Clean and Pure Location (शुचौ देशे):**
   - Śaṅkara explains *śucau* as a place that is either naturally clean or made clean by preparation (*svabhāvataḥ saṃskārataḥ*).
   - Purity and solitude (*vivikte*) are essential to avoid distractions and disturbances.

2. **Steady Seat (स्थिरमासनम्):**
   - *Sthiram* and *acalam* emphasize the importance of a stable seat for achieving concentration during meditation.

3. **Materials for the Seat:**
   - Śaṅkara highlights the combination of *cloth (caila)*, *deer skin (ajina)*, and *kuśa grass (kuśa)* as creating an appropriate surface.
   - The order of these materials is reversed in some scriptural contexts, but their functional arrangement remains critical.

4. **Avoidance of Extremes:**
   - The seat’s height should be moderate—neither too high nor too low (*nātyucchritaṃ nātinīcaṃ*)—to ensure comfort and focus.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Physical Foundation of Yoga:**
   - The verse underscores the role of external conditions (e.g., posture, location) as foundational to internal concentration and meditation.

2. **Balance and Moderation:**
   - The instruction to avoid extremes reflects the Gītā’s broader theme of moderation in all aspects of life, including spiritual practice.

3. **Integration of Environment and Practice:**
   - By emphasizing purity and stability, Śaṅkara highlights the interplay between external preparation and internal discipline in yoga.
