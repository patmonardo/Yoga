## Analysis

### Verse Structure
- **First Clause:** Arjuna identifies the yoga of equanimity as explained by Krishna.
- **Second Clause:** He expresses doubt about attaining its steadiness due to the restless nature of the mind.

### Śaṅkara’s Insights
1. **Yoga as Equanimity (साम्येन):**
   - Arjuna refers to yoga as described by Krishna, emphasizing *sāmyena*—the state of equanimity and sameness in all conditions.

2. **Restlessness of the Mind (चञ्चलत्वात् मनसः):**
   - Arjuna points out the inherent nature of the mind to be restless (*cañcala*), making the steady state of yoga seem unattainable to him.

3. **Unwavering Stability (स्थिराम् स्थितिम्):**
   - The steadiness Arjuna refers to is not merely temporary control but a firm and unshakable state (*sthirām acalāṃ sthitim*), which he finds difficult to visualize given the mind’s tendencies.

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Challenges in Yoga Practice:**
   - Arjuna’s doubt highlights a universal challenge in yoga—the difficulty of achieving mental steadiness due to the mind’s restless nature.

2. **Role of the Teacher (Madhusūdana):**
   - By addressing Krishna as *Madhusūdana* (slayer of the demon Madhu), Arjuna subtly appeals for Krishna’s guidance in overcoming this challenge.

3. **Equanimity as the Goal of Yoga:**
   - The verse reiterates that the ultimate goal of yoga is achieving equanimity, but it also acknowledges the struggle inherent in reaching that state.
