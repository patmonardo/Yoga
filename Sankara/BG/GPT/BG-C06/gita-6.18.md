### Translation (Śaṅkara Commentary)
When the mind is completely restrained (*viniyatam*), meaning specially disciplined and focused (*saṃyatam ekāgratām āpannam*),
and gives up all thoughts of external objects (*bāhyārthacintām*),
it rests (*avatiṣṭhate*) solely in the self (*ātmani eva kevale*), finding its stability there.

Such a yogī, free from craving (*niḥspṛhaḥ*) for all desires (*sarvakāmebhyaḥ*), whether related to visible or unseen objects (*dṛṣṭādṛṣṭaviṣayebhyaḥ*),
is said to be disciplined (*yuktaḥ* or *samāhitaḥ*).
This state occurs at that time (*tadā tasmin kāle*).

   - The yogī is free from attachment or craving (*spṛhā*) for both visible (*dṛṣṭa*) and unseen (*adṛṣṭa*) objects.
