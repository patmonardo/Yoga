### **Translation and Explanation:**

Lord Krishna, in the **Bhagavad Gita**, addresses the transient nature of physical experiences such as pleasure and pain. Arjuna has voiced concerns about the suffering caused by worldly circumstances, including the separation from the loved ones and the grief he experiences from the potential loss of those who are dear to him. In response to this, Krishna explains that although the **eternal soul (Atman)** is unaffected by death and remains imperishable, the **attachments** to the physical world can still create **miseries**. Here, he gives a practical teaching regarding dealing with worldly phenomena.

1. **"Yadyapi ātmavināśanimitto moho na sambhavati nitya ātmā iti vijānataḥ, tathāpi śītoṣṇasukhaduḥkhaprāptinimittō moho laukikō dṛśyate, sukhaviyōganimittō mōhaḥ duḥkhasaṁyōganimittashcha śōkḥ."**

   - Krishna acknowledges that, for those who recognize the **eternal nature of the soul (Atman)**, **attachment** to the physical body and its perishable experiences does not lead to delusion about the ultimate reality. The soul, being eternal and unchanging, remains unaffected by physical death.
   - **However, Krishna acknowledges that worldly delusion (moha)** still exists due to the emotional attachments to experiences such as **pleasure (sukha)**, **pain (duḥkha)**, and **climate-based fluctuations (śīta and uṣṇa)**. These worldly experiences often result in attachment to **pleasure** and **grief** (śokḥ), which are the result of **attachment** to sensory pleasures and **the fear of losing them**.
   - Specifically, **moha (delusion)** is born of the attachment to worldly pleasures and pain—**pleasure lost or grief born from the association with suffering**.

2. **"Mātrāspṛśāstu kaunteya śītoṣṇasukhaduḥkhadāḥ | āgamāpāyinō 'nityāstān titikṣasva bhārata || 14 ||"**

   - **"Mātrās"** refers to the **senses** (such as hearing, touching, seeing, etc.). These are the ways by which the body interacts with the world, perceiving the **contact** or **sensory stimuli** (spṛśā) from various **objects** or **experiences**.
   - **"Śītoṣṇa, sukha, duḥkha"**—these are all the experiences of the body: **cold (śīta)**, **heat (uṣṇa)**, **pleasure (sukha)**, and **pain (duḥkha)**, which arise from sensory interactions with the material world.
   - Krishna tells Arjuna that all these experiences are **temporary** and **transitory** (**āgamāpāyinah**, meaning "those which arise and disappear"). They are **impermanent**, and therefore **they should not be clung to**.
   - **"Titikṣasva"**—Krishna advises Arjuna to **endure** (tolerate) these fluctuations of pleasure and pain, heat and cold, because they are **temporary** and **will pass**. The proper attitude is to **tolerate** them with **equanimity**.

### **Key Insights:**

1. **The Nature of Sensory Experiences:**
   Krishna categorizes the sensory experiences (such as heat, cold, pleasure, pain) as **impermanent** phenomena that are temporary and cyclical. Just as **day follows night**, these experiences come and go in cycles, and there is no lasting substance to them. Therefore, one should not become overly attached to any of them.

2. **The Role of **Detachment**:
   Krishna emphasizes that worldly attachments, such as attachment to **pleasure** or **pain**, cause **delusion (moha)**. These attachments lead to grief (śokḥ) when **pleasures are lost** or **pain is suffered**. The wise individual, however, who **understands the temporary nature** of these sensory experiences, is able to remain **detached** and **equanimous** regardless of circumstances.

3. **Tolerating Impermanence (Titikṣa):**
   Krishna urges Arjuna to **bear** these experiences with **fortitude and patience**. As the experiences are fleeting, one should learn to **tolerate** them without getting swept away by them emotionally. This is a practical teaching on **mindfulness** and **detachment**, advising one not to be overly affected by the ups and downs of material life.

4. **Emotional Equanimity (Upekṣa):**
   The teaching of **titikṣa** (tolerance) encourages **emotional equanimity**. One should not let the enjoyment of sensory pleasures or the fear of sensory pain disturb their inner peace. By doing so, one can cultivate a steady mind and focus on higher spiritual goals, like **self-realization** (Atman-jnana).

---

### **Philosophical Implication:**

This verse underscores the **impermanence** of the material world and stresses the importance of **inner balance** and **detachment**. Krishna’s teaching is that although the **eternal soul** is beyond all pain and pleasure, the **temporary body** and its sensory experiences will continue to cause discomfort if one does not approach them with the right attitude. The goal is to transcend the emotional rollercoaster caused by attachment to these temporary experiences, recognizing that true peace lies in **self-realization** and in understanding the **eternal nature of the soul**.
