Below is the analysis of **Bhagavad Gītā 2.70** following our established methodology. We will break it down systematically: first the Mūla Verse, then Śaṅkara Bhāṣya, then Term Analysis, the Dialectical Structure, and finally the Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact. This approach allows us to maintain a consistent, rigorous examination of the text and commentary.

# Technical Analysis Artifact: Bhagavad Gītā 2.70

### I. Mūla Verse

**Sanskrit**
```markdown
आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं समुद्रमापः प्रविशन्ति यद्वत् ।
तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी ॥ ७० ॥
```

**Transliteration**
```markdown
āpūryamāṇam acala-pratiṣṭhaṃ samudram āpaḥ praviśanti yadvat |
tadvat kāmā yaṃ praviśanti sarve sa śāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī || 70 ||
```

**Translation**
"Just as the ocean, ever full and unshaken, remains unmoved even though all waters flow into it, similarly, one into whom all desires enter without causing disturbance achieves peace, not the one who yearns for desires."

### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

**Key Sanskrit Excerpts (Provided Text)**
```markdown
आपूर्यमाणम् ... अचलप्रतिष्ठं समुद्रम् ... आपः ... प्रविशन्ति यद्वत्
तद्वत्कामा ... यं ... अविकुर्वन्तः प्रविशन्ति सर्वे ... सः शान्तिं मोक्षम् आप्नोति
न इतरः कामकामी ...
```

**Key Points from the Bhāṣya**:
- **Ocean as an Analogy**: Śaṅkara draws a comparison between the sage and a full, stable ocean. The ocean is constantly fed by rivers (waters) flowing into it, yet it remains unchanged in its fullness, not overflowing or being disturbed.
- **Desires Enter but Do Not Disturb**: Just as the ocean retains its equilibrium, the sage does not become agitated by desires. Even though desires (kāmāḥ) approach, they find no hold, dissolving into the sage’s stable awareness without altering it.
- **Contrast with the Desire-Seeker**: The one who chases after desires (kāma-kāmī) never attains peace. True peace (śānti, equated with mokṣa) is reserved for one who is fully content and no longer swayed by the lure of sense-objects.

Śaṅkara uses this illustration to reiterate that a wise, desireless sage achieves liberation. Desires, which previously incited action and restlessness, now vanish into the sage’s unperturbed consciousness, bringing perfect tranquility.

### III. Term Analysis

- **आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठम् (āpūryamāṇam acala-pratiṣṭham)**:
  *Meaning*: Continuously filled and unwavering in its stance.
  *Contextual Significance*: The ocean symbolizes a state of fullness and immovability. For the sage, this represents a mind established in the Self, not dependent on external fulfillments and thus unaffected by the inflow of desires.

- **कामा (kāmāḥ)**:
  *Meaning*: Desires or wishful impulses for sense-objects.
  *Contextual Significance*: Desires typically agitate the mind, prompting pursuit or avoidance. In the sage described here, desires lose their power, merging into the stable mind without provoking action or disturbance.

- **शान्ति (śānti)**:
  *Meaning*: Peace, calmness, also implying mokṣa (liberation).
  *Contextual Significance*: True peace comes when the mind, like the ocean, remains full and stable, not depleted or excited by incoming desires. Such peace signifies liberation from the bondage of wanting.

- **कामकामी (kāma-kāmī)**:
  *Meaning*: One who longs for desires, a person constantly seeking to fulfill cravings.
  *Contextual Significance*: The opposite of the stable sage. This person never finds rest, as each fulfilled desire only begets another. Without ending the cycle of craving, peace remains unattainable.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: Ordinarily, individuals are like containers that overflow or empty based on desires coming and going, constantly disturbed by their flux.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: The analogy of the ocean shows that a realized being is inherently complete. Desires flow toward this person as rivers to the ocean, but they do not cause disturbance or change. This reflects the essence of the sage’s mind: inherently full, stable, and self-sufficient.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: The culminating concept is that lasting peace arises not from fulfilling desires but from transcending them. By dwelling in a state beyond craving, the sage aligns with non-dual fullness, achieving the ultimate tranquility (śānti). This stable fullness is the hallmark of mokṣa, where external objects lose their power to disrupt the mind’s equilibrium.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Systematic Transition from Dependence to Autonomy**: Rational analysis shows that chasing desires perpetuates dependence. Experientially, the sage, like the ocean, needs no external addition to feel complete. This parallels a transcendental movement from conditional happiness to unconditional bliss.

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: In a non-dual perspective, the Self is complete by nature. Desires stem from perceived lack. The sage’s completeness means no perceived lack remains. Desires, therefore, do not find a foothold, dissolving into awareness without trace.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: Similar to Buddhism’s teaching that craving (taṇhā) leads to suffering and must be overcome for nirvāṇa, here the Gītā states one attains śānti by neutralizing the impact of desires. Yoga’s pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā stabilize the mind, allowing one’s consciousness to remain ocean-like, unshaken by desires.

- **From Dharana to Stability**: Dhāraṇā establishes mental equilibrium. With steady concentration, the practitioner becomes capable of facing desires without being disturbed. This stable concentration evolves into a state where desires merely pass through the mind, resulting in true śānti and readiness for dhyāna and samādhi.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: Realizing the Self as infinite fullness (like the ocean) negates any sense of lack. Desires cannot add or subtract from this fullness. The sage rests in Brahman, unaffected by the flow of sensory stimuli, thereby abiding in liberation.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: In Abhidharma, eradicating craving ends mental proliferation and disturbance. Similarly, the sage’s state here shows the cessation of craving leads to unwavering peace.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.70 concludes that only a person free from desire’s push and pull achieves stable peace. By being inherently full and grounded, like an ocean untouched by incoming waters, the sage exemplifies the ideal spiritual maturity. This maturity is essential for final liberation, integrating Yogic discipline with Vedāntic insight.

- **Gateway to Mokṣa**: This verse teaches that tranquility and mokṣa do not come from external acquisitions but from an internal state of completeness. The sage’s mind does not need external validations (desires fulfilled), reflecting a state of pure inward fullness characteristic of an enlightened being.

# Conclusion

In Bhagavad Gītā 2.70, the ocean metaphor encapsulates the sage’s inner plenitude and unassailability. Desires may approach, but like water entering a vast ocean, they fail to alter its nature. Such a person alone finds śānti and mokṣa, not the one who perpetually chases desires. This lesson integrates seamlessly with the preceding teachings on sense-control and the transcendence of attachment, guiding one toward an unshakable inner completeness.
