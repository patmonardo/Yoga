## **III. Summary**

In verse 2.15, Lord Krishna highlights the qualities that make one fit for liberation. Śaṅkara's commentary elaborates that a person who remains undisturbed by sensory experiences—such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain—and who is steadfast and equanimous, becomes eligible for immortality (moksha). This state is achieved through the vision of the eternal Self, recognizing that the true Self is unchanging amidst the transient nature of sensory experiences.

By cultivating equanimity and steadfastness, one transcends the dualities of life, thereby progressing on the path to liberation. The wise person understands that external conditions are impermanent and does not allow them to disturb inner peace.
