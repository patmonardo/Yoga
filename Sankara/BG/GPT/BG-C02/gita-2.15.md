1. **"Yaṁ hi na vyathayantyete puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha, samaduḥkhasukhaṁ dhīraṁ so 'mṛtatvāya kalpate."**

   - **"Yaṁ hi puruṣaṁ na vyathayanti ete"** refers to the person who is not disturbed or affected by **the pairs of opposites** such as **pleasure and pain** (**sukha and duḥkha**), **cold and heat** (**śīta and uṣṇa**), or any such worldly experiences.
   - **"Puruṣarṣabha"** (meaning "the best of men" or "O Arjuna") is a title used by Krishna to address Arjuna, emphasizing that this person is of the highest caliber in terms of spiritual wisdom and practice.
   - **"Samaduḥkhasukhaṁ dhīraṁ"** refers to one who remains **equanimous** and **steady-minded** in the face of **both pain and pleasure**, achieving an inner state of peace and balance.
   - **"So 'mṛtatvāya kalpate"** means that such a person is **fit for immortality (amṛtatva)**, as their understanding transcends the fleeting pleasures and pains of the material world. This immortality refers not to bodily life but to spiritual liberation (**mokṣa**), where one attains unity with the **eternal soul (Atman)**.

2. **Interpretation of the Verse:**

   - The verse emphasizes that the **realized person** or **spiritually awakened individual** does not react to **the sensory stimuli** of the world in the same way ordinary people do. Instead, they experience **inner peace** and remain undisturbed by external fluctuations, whether they be **pleasure or pain**.
   - This **mental equanimity** is a key to **spiritual liberation** because it allows the person to overcome the **temporary nature of material experiences**. By staying anchored in the **eternal nature of the self (Atman)**, the individual is not swayed by external forces, leading to **spiritual freedom** and the realization of **immortality**.
   - **"Amṛtatvāya"** refers to attaining the state of **moksha**, which is the ultimate freedom from the cycle of birth and death. One who is able to maintain such equanimity becomes **fit for liberation** because they no longer identify with the material body or the transient experiences that accompany it.

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Equanimity as Spiritual Strength:**
   The verse strongly affirms that **spiritual strength** lies in maintaining equanimity through the ups and downs of life. Such a person, who remains unaffected by **pleasure** or **pain**, **cold** or **heat**, exhibits wisdom and mental fortitude that is essential for reaching **spiritual liberation**.

2. **Immortality Beyond the Physical Body:**
   The verse clarifies that **immortality** in the spiritual sense is not related to physical existence but to the **realization of the eternal self (Atman)**. This realization leads to **freedom from the cycle of birth and death**, which is the true meaning of **amṛtatvāya**.

3. **Endurance of Dualities:**
   The teachings here focus on the **tolerance of dualities** (duḥkha and sukha, śīta and uṣṇa). The ability to transcend these experiences indicates a **high level of spiritual maturity**, where one's identity is no longer bound to the transient conditions of the world but is rooted in the **eternal**.

---

### **Philosophical Implication:**

This verse reinforces a central theme of **Vedantic** philosophy, which teaches that the true self (Atman) is **beyond the dualities** of the material world. While the **body** and **mind** may go through experiences of pleasure and pain, the **self**, which is **eternal**, remains untouched by these experiences. Krishna's teaching to Arjuna is one of **detachment** from the material world and a **shift in perspective**, where one recognizes their true identity as **the eternal soul**. By doing so, one can transcend the **cycle of suffering** and achieve **moksha**.
