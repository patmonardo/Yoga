प्रकृतं तु वक्ष्यामः । तत्र आत्मनः अविनाशित्वं प्रतिज्ञातम् । तत् किमिवेति, उच्यते —
वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि ।
तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णान्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही ॥ २२ ॥
वासांसि वस्त्राणि जीर्णानि दुर्बलतां गतानि यथा लोके विहाय परित्यज्य नवानि अभिनवानि गृह्णाति उपादत्ते नरः पुरुषः अपराणि अन्यानि, तथा तद्वदेव शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णानि अन्यानि संयाति सङ्गच्छति नवानि देही आत्मा पुरुषवत् अविक्रिय एवेत्यर्थः ॥ २२ ॥

Apologies for that shift in style—let’s go back to the concise transliterated approach we had been using, fully aligned with your study method. Here’s Verse 22 with that focus:

**Verse 22 Transliteration and Commentary**

> **vāsāṃsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya navāni gṛhṇāti naro’parāṇi |
> tathā śarīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇānyanyāni saṃyāti navāni dehī || 22 ||**

### Commentary

1. **Analogy of Garments**:
   - **“vāsāṃsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya”** – Just as a person discards worn-out garments,
   - **“navāni gṛhṇāti naro’parāṇi”** – and takes up new ones,
   - **“tathā śarīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇāni”** – similarly, the **dehī** (embodied Self) leaves behind old, worn-out bodies,
   - **“anyāni saṃyāti navāni”** – and takes on new ones, seamlessly moving from one form to another.

2. **Immutability of the Self**:
   - Śaṅkara emphasizes the **avikriyā** (unchangeable nature) of **ātman**. Just as clothing changes don’t alter the identity of the wearer, so the Self remains untouched, unaffected by the body’s transitions.
   - The Self’s *essentially eternal nature* is indicated here as beyond even the cycle of embodiment and disembodiment—no phase of material existence influences or binds it.

3. **Material Detachment**:
   - The verse addresses the discernment (viveka) between the **ātman** and the **deha** (body), suggesting the Self’s independence from all physical attributes.
   - The teaching nudges one to view the body as merely an instrument, like clothing, while recognizing that the Self remains the pure witness—*eternally observing* but *never altering*.

This verse aligns us with the teaching that **ātman** is not subject to birth, decay, or death, reflecting the Gītā’s vision of the Self as *nitya* (eternal) and *avikṛta* (unchangeable). Let me know if you’d like to continue directly with the next verse or explore this analogy in further depth.
