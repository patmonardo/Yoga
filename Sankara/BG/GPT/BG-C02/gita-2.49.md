*"Because those who perform inferior action are pitiable (kṛpaṇāḥ), miserable, being motivated by desire for fruits, impelled by craving for results, as the Śruti says: 'He who departs from this world without knowing the imperishable, O Gārgī, is a kṛpaṇa (miserable)' (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.10)."*
