दुर्विज्ञेयोऽयं प्रकृत आत्मा ; किं त्वामेवैकमुपालभे साधारणे भ्रान्तिनिमित्ते । कथं दुर्विज्ञेयोऽयमात्मा इत्यत आह —

Let's now analyze **Verse 29** of the Bhagavad Gita with detailed commentary and interpretation.

### **Transliteration of Verse 29:**

**āścharyavat paśyati kaśchidenam āścharyavad vādati tathaiva cānyaḥ**
**āścharyavac cainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti śrutvāpyenaṁ veda na caiva kaśchit || 29 ||

### **Sanskrit Commentary:**

**1. "आश्चर्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेनमाश्चर्यवद्वदति तथैव चान्यः" (āścharyavat paśyati kaśchidenam āścharyavad vādati tathaiva cānyaḥ)**

- **"आश्चर्यवत्" (āścharyavat)**: "Like a wonder" or "as something wondrous."
  - The word *āścharyavat* indicates something extraordinary or miraculous. The self (ātman) is seen in this way because it is not easily comprehensible and is beyond ordinary understanding.
- **"पश्यति कश्चिदेनम्" (paśyati kaśchidenam)**: "Some see it."
  - This indicates that the realization of the ātman is rare and not accessible to everyone. Only those who are spiritually advanced or have proper understanding can perceive the true nature of the ātman.
- **"आश्चर्यवत् वदति तथैव च अन्यः" (āścharyavat vādati tathaiva cānyaḥ)**: "Some speak of it as if it is a wonder."
  - Just as the sight of something miraculous elicits wonder, people may speak of the self (ātman) in the same awe-struck manner, unable to fully understand its essence.

**Interpretation**: The verse highlights the mysterious and awe-inspiring nature of the ātman, which remains elusive to most people. Some may have glimpses of it or speak of it, but truly understanding it is rare.

**2. "आश्चर्यवच्चैनमन्यः शृणोति श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित्" (āścharyavac cainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti śrutvāpyenaṁ veda na caiva kaśchit)**

- **"आश्चर्यवच्" (āścharyavat)**: Again, "as something wondrous."
  - The repetition emphasizes the awe that the self (ātman) inspires in those who hear about it or come into contact with it, as it is not easily grasped or understood.
- **"एनम् अन्यः शृणोति" (enam anyaḥ śṛṇoti)**: "Another hears it."
  - This refers to the fact that while some may hear of the ātman from others or from scriptures, understanding or truly knowing it is another matter.
- **"श्रुत्वापि एनं वेद न चैव कश्चित्" (śrutvāpyenaṁ veda na caiva kaśchit)**: "Even after hearing of it, no one knows it truly."
  - This indicates the difficulty in fully comprehending the ātman, even when one is exposed to teachings or scriptures that speak of it. Knowledge of the self is not mere intellectual understanding but a deep realization that transcends ordinary cognition.

**Interpretation**: Even though the teachings about the ātman may be heard by many, its true nature is not easily understood by all. True knowledge of the self comes only through direct realization and is beyond mere hearing or intellectual grasp.

### **Śaṅkara's Insights:**

Śaṅkara elaborates on the difficulty of understanding the ātman and notes that:

1. **Elusive Nature**: The ātman is described as both wondrous and difficult to perceive. While some may see it, speak of it, or hear about it, the vast majority do not truly know it because it lies beyond the realm of ordinary perception and intellectual comprehension.
2. **Misunderstanding of the ātman**: Even hearing about the ātman or contemplating its nature does not guarantee realization. The self is an object of wonder because it transcends the limitations of empirical experience. It cannot be directly seen or understood by the senses.
3. **The Need for Direct Experience**: True knowledge of the ātman arises not from theoretical knowledge but from direct experiential insight. This is why, even when the self is described or discussed, it is still a mystery to those who are not spiritually attuned.

### **Practical Application:**

This verse serves as a reminder that the pursuit of spiritual knowledge requires more than intellectual engagement. The self (ātman) is not easily understood by the mind alone, nor is it accessible to all people. It is something to be experienced directly and realized through deep meditation, contemplation, and self-inquiry. Arjuna, as a seeker, is reminded that the true knowledge of the self is rare, and only those who have transcended the ordinary way of thinking can truly see, speak of, or understand the ātman. Thus, the verse encourages a deeper focus on experiential knowledge over mere intellectual or hearsay-based understanding.

---

### **Summary:**

In **Verse 29**, Krishna emphasizes the elusive and wondrous nature of the ātman. Though some may see or hear of it, the true nature of the self is not easily grasped. Understanding the ātman requires more than hearing or intellectual comprehension—it demands direct experience. This verse highlights the rarity of true spiritual insight and encourages Arjuna, and all seekers, to go beyond ordinary perception in their quest for knowledge of the self.
