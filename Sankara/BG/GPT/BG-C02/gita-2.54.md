In **Verse 2.54** of the **Bhagavad Gītā**, **Arjuna** asks **Lord Krishna** about the characteristics of a person who has attained steady wisdom (*sthita-prajña*) and is established in deep meditation (*Samādhi*). He inquires how such a person speaks, sits, and walks, seeking to understand the external expressions of enlightenment. **Śaṅkarācārya's commentary** explains that Arjuna is asking about the signs that indicate someone has realized 'I am the Supreme Brahman.'
