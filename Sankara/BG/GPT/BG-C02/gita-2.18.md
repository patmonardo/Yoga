Let's break down the verse from Śaṅkara's commentary, which explains a critical distinction between the **eternal self** (Ātman) and the **perishable body**. We will analyze it step by step.

### Sanskrit Text:
**किं पुनस्तदसत्, यत्स्वात्मसत्तां व्यभिचरतीति, उच्यते —**
**अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः।**
**अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥ १८ ॥**

---

### **Translation and Breakdown of the Verse:**

1. **"किं पुनस्तदसत्, यत्स्वात्मसत्तां व्यभिचरतीति, उच्यते —"**
   - **"किं पुनः"**: "What then?"
   - **"तदसत्"**: "That is, the body is perishable (or that which is impermanent)."
   - **"यत्स्वात्मसत्तां"**: "Since the self's existence (nature) is consistent with its own essence."
   - **"व्यभिचरतीति"**: "It is said to be perishable (subject to change)."
   - **"उच्यते"**: "It is said (thus)."

   **Explanation**: The question arises about the **nature of the self** and how it relates to the idea of change or perishing. The verse responds by contrasting the **eternal self (Ātman)** with the **perishable body**.

---

2. **"अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः।"**
   - **"अन्तवन्त"**: "Perishable" (having an end, subject to decay).
   - **"इमे देहा"**: "These bodies" (the physical bodies of individuals).
   - **"नित्यस्योक्ताः"**: "Are spoken of as eternal" (referring to the body as impermanent despite being perceived as eternal in worldly terms).
   - **"शरीरिणः"**: "Of those who have a body."

   **Explanation**: The body is said to be **perishable**, although it is **seen as eternal** in the world due to attachment or the illusory view. However, **Brahman** (the eternal self) is **imperishable**, and the body is in contrast to this **eternality**.

---

3. **"अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥ १८ ॥"**
   - **"अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य"**: "Of the imperishable, immeasurable (self),"
   - **"तस्माद्युध्यस्व"**: "Therefore, fight (strive),"
   - **"भारत"**: "O Bharata (Arjuna)."

   **Explanation**: The **self** (Atman) is described as **imperishable** and beyond the reach of destruction or measurement. Since the self is imperishable, Arjuna is urged to **act with detachment**, understanding that the soul is beyond the physical realm and cannot be destroyed.

---

### **Śaṅkara's Commentary (Breaking It Down):**

- **Context of Perishability and Eternity**: Śaṅkara elaborates that the **perishable body** is not the true self. The bodies we inhabit are perishable and subject to destruction, just like any physical object. On the other hand, **Brahman** (the ultimate reality) is **eternal** and **imperishable**. He explains that the physical body is like a **dream body** or **illusionary body** which is subject to **decay**.

- **Contrast Between Perishable and Imperishable**: He emphasizes that the true **self** (Atman) is not subject to change or decay, unlike the **body** which is perishable. The distinction is crucial in understanding the **eternality of Brahman** and the **impermanence of the material world**. The **imperishable nature of the self** is highlighted by Śaṅkara to underscore the importance of **spiritual wisdom** in recognizing the ultimate truth.

- **"Nityasya" and "Anāśinaḥ"**: The terms **nitya** (eternal) and **anāśinaḥ** (imperishable) highlight the **unchanging** nature of the **self**. Śaṅkara notes that **nitya** refers to the self's unchanging nature, while **anāśinaḥ** points to the fact that it cannot be destroyed, even by external forces, including **Ishvara** (God).

- **The Call to Action (Yudhya)**: Śaṅkara connects the philosophical concept to Arjuna’s situation, urging him to fight (or strive) without attachment. By recognizing that the **self is eternal**, one can act in the world without fear of death or destruction, understanding that death pertains only to the body, not the self.

---

### **Key Philosophical Points:**
- **The Body is Perishable**: The body is mortal and subject to decay, whereas the **self** (Atman) is eternal.
- **Brahman is Imperishable**: The ultimate reality (Brahman) is beyond destruction, and this is the true essence of **self**.
- **Action and Detachment**: Understanding the eternal nature of the self allows one to engage in the world and fulfill one’s duties without attachment to the outcomes, recognizing the difference between the transient body and the eternal soul.

Sanskrit Text:

```sanskrit
ननु आगमेन आत्मा परिच्छिद्यते, प्रत्यक्षादिना च पूर्वम्। न; आत्मनः स्वतःसिद्धत्वात्। सिद्धे हि आत्मनि प्रमातरि प्रमित्सोः प्रमाणान्वेषणा भवति। न हि पूर्वम् ‘इत्थमहम्’ इति आत्मानमप्रमाय पश्चात् प्रमेयपरिच्छेदाय प्रवर्तते। न हि आत्मा नाम कस्यचित् अप्रसिद्धो भवति। शास्त्रं तु अन्त्यं प्रमाणम् अतद्धर्माध्यारोपणमात्रनिवर्तकत्वेन प्रमाणत्वम् आत्मनः प्रतिपद्यते, न तु अज्ञातार्थज्ञापकत्वेन। तथा च श्रुतिः — ‘यत्साक्षादपरोक्षाद्ब्रह्म य आत्मा सर्वान्तरः’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ५ । १) इति ॥
```

This passage from Śaṅkara's commentary delves into the relationship between the self (Ātman), knowledge, and perception, particularly addressing concerns about the **self's** existence being **limited** or **defined** by external means like scripture (āgama) or direct perception (pratyakṣa). Here's a breakdown of this complex argument.

### Sanskrit Text:
**ननु आगमेन आत्मा परिच्छिद्यते, प्रत्यक्षादिना च पूर्वम्।**
**न; आत्मनः स्वतःसिद्धत्वात्। सिद्धे हि आत्मनि प्रमातरि प्रमित्सोः प्रमाणान्वेषणा भवति।**
**न हि पूर्वम् ‘इत्थमहम्’ इति आत्मानमप्रमाय पश्चात् प्रमेयपरिच्छेदाय प्रवर्तते।**
**न हि आत्मा नाम कस्यचित् अप्रसिद्धो भवति।**
**शास्त्रं तु अन्त्यं प्रमाणम् अतद्धर्माध्यारोपणमात्रनिवर्तकत्वेन प्रमाणत्वम् आत्मनः प्रतिपद्यते, न तु अज्ञातार्थज्ञापकत्वेन।**
**तथा च श्रुतिः — ‘यत्साक्षादपरोक्षाद्ब्रह्म य आत्मा सर्वान्तरः’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ५ । १) इति ॥**

---

### **Translation and Breakdown of the Verse:**

1. **"ननु आगमेन आत्मा परिच्छिद्यते, प्रत्यक्षादिना च पूर्वम्।"**
   - **"ननु"**: "But" or "however"
   - **"आगमेन"**: "By scripture" (i.e., transmitted knowledge, or śruti)
   - **"आत्मा परिच्छिद्यते"**: "The self is restricted" or "limited"
   - **"प्रत्यक्षादिना"**: "By direct perception"
   - **"च पूर्वम्"**: "And earlier" (i.e., prior to realization)

   **Explanation**: The question arises about whether the **self (Ātman)** is confined or limited by external means such as **scripture (āgama)** or **direct perception (pratyakṣa)**. The passage sets up the concern that the **self** might be understood or apprehended through these means.

---

2. **"न; आत्मनः स्वतःसिद्धत्वात्।"**
   - **"न"**: "No"
   - **"आत्मनः स्वतःसिद्धत्वात्"**: "Because the self is self-evident (inherently established or realized)"

   **Explanation**: Śaṅkara rejects the idea that the **self** (Ātman) is **limited** by external means, emphasizing that the **self** is inherently self-evident and does not require external validation or definition. It is **realized** (siddha) inherently, not defined by something external like perception or scripture.

---

3. **"सिद्धे हि आत्मनि प्रमातरि प्रमित्सोः प्रमाणान्वेषणा भवति।"**
   - **"सिद्धे"**: "When it is established" or "realized"
   - **"हि"**: "Indeed"
   - **"आत्मनि"**: "In the self"
   - **"प्रमातरि प्रमित्सोः"**: "The knower and the known"
   - **"प्रमाणान्वेषणा भवति"**: "The search for proof (or the necessity of means of knowledge) becomes irrelevant"

   **Explanation**: Once the **self (Ātman)** is realized, there is no further need to seek external means (like perception or scripture) to verify it. The **self** is not dependent on external verification; it is directly realized.

---

4. **"न हि पूर्वम् ‘इत्थमहम्’ इति आत्मानमप्रमाय पश्चात् प्रमेयपरिच्छेदाय प्रवर्तते।"**
   - **"न हि पूर्वम्"**: "Not previously"
   - **"‘इत्थमहम्’ इति"**: "With the thought 'I am this'"
   - **"आत्मानमप्रमाय"**: "Not realized as separate"
   - **"पश्चात् प्रमेयपरिच्छेदाय प्रवर्तते"**: "Later it begins to be limited by the object of knowledge (the perceived world)"

   **Explanation**: The realization of the **self** does not happen in stages through **conceptual limitations** or the process of **identification** with objects. The self is not defined by thoughts like **'I am this'**, nor does it later become confined by the limits of objects known through perception.

---

5. **"न हि आत्मा नाम कस्यचित् अप्रसिद्धो भवति।"**
   - **"न हि"**: "Indeed not"
   - **"आत्मा नाम कस्यचित्"**: "The self is not unknown (to anyone)"
   - **"अप्रसिद्धो भवति"**: "It is never unknown"

   **Explanation**: The **self (Ātman)** is **never unknown**. It is **inherently known** or self-evident to the individual. There is no moment when the **self** is not recognized by consciousness itself.

---

6. **"शास्त्रं तु अन्त्यं प्रमाणम् अतद्धर्माध्यारोपणमात्रनिवर्तकत्वेन प्रमाणत्वम् आत्मनः प्रतिपद्यते, न तु अज्ञातार्थज्ञापकत्वेन।"**
   - **"शास्त्रं तु"**: "Scripture (the Vedas) is indeed"
   - **"अन्त्यं प्रमाणम्"**: "The ultimate means of knowledge"
   - **"अतद्धर्माध्यारोपणमात्रनिवर्तकत्वेन"**: "Only to dispel the imposition of false attributes"
   - **"प्रमाणत्वम् आत्मनः प्रतिपद्यते"**: "The recognition of the self’s reality is established"
   - **"न तु अज्ञातार्थज्ञापकत्वेन"**: "Not as an indicator of the unknown"

   **Explanation**: The **scriptures** serve as the **ultimate means of knowledge**, not to directly **reveal** the **self**, which is already self-evident, but to **dispel false concepts** or **misunderstandings** about the self. The self is not something that is **discovered** through scripture as something previously unknown, but the scriptures help remove **false attributions** placed upon the **self**.

---

7. **"तथा च श्रुतिः — ‘यत्साक्षादपरोक्षाद्ब्रह्म य आत्मा सर्वान्तरः’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ५ । १) इति"**
   - **"तथा च"**: "And thus"
   - **"श्रुतिः"**: "The scripture (Veda)"
   - **"‘यत्साक्षादपरोक्षाद्ब्रह्म य आत्मा सर्वान्तरः’"**: "That which is directly realized, Brahman, which is the self, is the inner essence of all"
   - **"बृ. उ. ३ । ५ । १"**: "Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.5.1"

   **Explanation**: Śaṅkara quotes the **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad** to reinforce his point that the **self (Ātman)** is **directly realized** and **inherently known** to all beings. The **Upaniṣad** describes Brahman (the ultimate reality) as **the inner essence** of everything, directly accessible to the true seeker.

---

### **Summary of Śaṅkara's Argument:**

1. **The Self is Self-Evident**: The **self (Ātman)** is not defined or confined by external means like **scripture** or **perception**. It is inherently known and realized by consciousness itself.

2. **Scripture's Role**: The **Vedic scriptures** do not serve to directly reveal the **self**, which is already known, but rather to **dispell false attributions** or misconceptions about the **self**.

3. **Self-Realization**: The **self** is always **self-evident** and requires no external means to be known. Scriptures serve to clarify and remove misunderstandings, not to prove the self's existence.

4. **Support from Śruti**: The **Upaniṣads** confirm that **Brahman**, the ultimate reality, is directly realizable and is the **inner essence of all**, emphasizing the non-dual nature of the **self**.

This commentary addresses critical epistemological issues in Vedanta, clarifying how the **self** is recognized and understood in non-dual terms. Let me know if you'd like to delve further into any specific part!

```sanskrit
न हि अत्र युद्धकर्तव्यता विधीयते, युद्धे प्रवृत्त एव हि असौ शोकमोहप्रतिबद्धः तूष्णीमास्ते । अतः तस्य प्रतिबन्धापनयनमात्रं भगवता क्रियते । तस्मात् ‘युध्यस्व’ इति अनुवादमात्रम् , न विधिः ॥ १८ ॥
```
The verse you've provided continues from the **Bhagavad Gita** (Chapter 2, Verse 18), where Lord Krishna addresses Arjuna's reluctance to engage in battle. Śaṅkara provides an insightful commentary on the deeper meaning of Krishna’s words and the role of **karma** and **duty** (dharma) in this context.

### Sanskrit Text:
**न हि अत्र युद्धकर्तव्यता विधीयते, युद्धे प्रवृत्त एव हि असौ शोकमोहप्रतिबद्धः तूष्णीमास्ते।**
**अतः तस्य प्रतिबन्धापनयनमात्रं भगवता क्रियते।**
**तस्मात् ‘युध्यस्व’ इति अनुवादमात्रम्, न विधिः।**

---

### **Translation and Breakdown of the Verse:**

1. **"न हि अत्र युद्धकर्तव्यता विधीयते, युद्धे प्रवृत्त एव हि असौ शोकमोहप्रतिबद्धः तूष्णीमास्ते।"**
   - **"न हि अत्र"**: "Indeed, here (in this context)"
   - **"युद्धकर्तव्यता विधीयते"**: "There is no prescription for the obligation to fight"
   - **"युद्धे प्रवृत्त एव हि"**: "He has already been involved in the battle"
   - **"असौ शोकमोहप्रतिबद्धः"**: "He is bound by grief and delusion"
   - **"तूष्णीमास्ते"**: "He remains silent (or in a state of passive inaction)"

   **Explanation**: Śaṅkara emphasizes that **Arjuna**'s hesitation to fight is due to his emotional state (shoka and moha—grief and delusion), not because he is unaware of his duty. Arjuna is already engaged in the battle, and his current emotional response has caused him to remain **silent** (tuṣṇīṁ—inactive or stuck in confusion). There is no need for a command to fight because his emotional state is what binds him, not an obligation to act.

---

2. **"अतः तस्य प्रतिबन्धापनयनमात्रं भगवता क्रियते।"**
   - **"अतः"**: "Therefore"
   - **"तस्य"**: "His"
   - **"प्रतिबन्धापनयनमात्रं"**: "The mere removal of his binding (emotional) attachment"
   - **"भगवता क्रियते"**: "Is done by Bhagavan (the Lord)"

   **Explanation**: Śaṅkara explains that Krishna’s teaching to Arjuna is not an imposition of an obligation to fight, but rather the removal of Arjuna's **emotional binding** (shoka and moha) that keeps him in a state of passivity. Lord Krishna is helping Arjuna overcome his confusion and attachment, allowing him to regain his clarity and perform his duty.

---

3. **"तस्मात् ‘युध्यस्व’ इति अनुवादमात्रम्, न विधिः।"**
   - **"तस्मात्"**: "Therefore"
   - **"‘युध्यस्व’ इति"**: "'You should fight'"
   - **"अनुवादमात्रम्"**: "Is only a translation (interpretation)"
   - **"न विधिः"**: "Not a command (duty)"

   **Explanation**: Śaṅkara clarifies that Krishna's instruction, **“Yudhyasva”** ("You should fight"), is not a **command** (a direct obligation or directive) but rather an **interpretation** or **explanation** of Arjuna’s **own duty**. The advice is given to remove Arjuna’s confusion and to encourage him to act, but not as a directive that imposes guilt or a rigid obligation.

---

### **Summary of Śaṅkara’s Commentary:**

1. **Arjuna's Hesitation**: Arjuna is not being told that it is his duty to fight (as an external command), but rather, he is caught in **emotional turmoil** (grief and delusion). His inner confusion is what prevents him from acting.

2. **Krishna’s Role**: Lord Krishna’s intervention is focused on removing these emotional bindings that prevent Arjuna from performing his duty. Krishna’s guidance is to clear Arjuna’s mind, not to impose a harsh command.

3. **The Nature of the Instruction**: The instruction to "fight" is not a direct prescription of what Arjuna must do in terms of external duty but an encouragement to **realize** his **inherent duty** without emotional confusion. Krishna’s words are not about an imposition but about helping Arjuna transcend his emotional entanglements so that he can carry out his responsibilities with clarity.

### **Key Takeaway:**
Śaṅkara's commentary reflects the idea that **duty (dharma)** is not merely a set of prescribed actions but should be performed from a state of **mental clarity** and **detachment** from emotional distractions. The command to fight is not a rigid instruction but an encouragement to overcome **emotional paralysis** (shoka and moha) and act from a place of **clear understanding**.

```
This is a great stopping point, and it looks like you've picked up where Śaṅkara's commentary and the **Bhagavad Gita** continue to delve deeper into the nature of **action**, **identity**, and the **self** (Atman) in relation to the body and its experiences.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the **19th verse** you've provided:

---

### **Verse 19 (Bhagavad Gita 2.19)**:

**Sanskrit Text:**

**य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम्।**
**उभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते॥**

---

### **Translation and Breakdown:**

1. **"य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं"**: "He who knows the killer (the one who kills)"
   - This refers to the person who perceives themselves or another as the killer, as someone engaged in the act of killing.

2. **"यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम्"**: "And he who thinks of him as killed"
   - This refers to the person who believes that the entity is being killed, specifically the body in this context, which is often confused with the **self** (Atman).

3. **"उभौ तौ न विजानीतो"**: "Both of them do not know"
   - This indicates that both individuals (the one who thinks of themselves as the killer and the one who thinks they are killed) are ignorant of the true nature of the **self**. They are unable to recognize the essential, unchanging **Atman**.

4. **"नायं हन्ति न हन्यते"**: "He neither kills nor is killed"
   - This emphasizes that the **Atman**, the true self, is **imperishable**. It is not subject to the processes of birth, death, or destruction, and thus is beyond the scope of **killing** or **being killed**.

---

### **Śaṅkara’s Commentary (Explanation):**

Śaṅkara explains this verse in the following way:

1. **Understanding the Self Beyond the Body:**
   - The key point in this verse is the distinction between the **Atman** (the Self, which is eternal and beyond physical reality) and the **body** (which is subject to birth and destruction).
   - He clarifies that the **body** can be destroyed, but **Atman**, being **eternal** and **imperishable**, cannot be killed. The act of killing or being killed only applies to the **body**, and not to the **true self**.

2. **Ignorance of True Identity:**
   - Those who think they are killing others (or being killed) are **ignorant** of the true nature of the self. They misidentify themselves with the body and thus perceive **death** as an event that affects the self, which is a **false assumption**.
   - The **Atman** is not subject to **death** because it is not a material object or a temporary form; it is pure consciousness.

3. **The Essence of Non-Violence (Ahimsa):**
   - Śaṅkara stresses that **the true Self** does not engage in **violence**, nor does it experience it. This is a key teaching in the Gita, especially related to **Ahimsa** (non-violence). The true **Self** remains unaffected by any harm done to the **body**.

4. **Imperishability of Atman:**
   - The verse asserts that **Atman** is **indestructible** and **immutable**. Śaṅkara underscores that it is only **ignorance** (avidya) that causes one to think that **Atman** is **subject to death**. Once true knowledge (jnana) is gained, one realizes that the **Atman** is beyond any physical destruction.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **The Body vs. The Self (Atman)**: The **Atman** (True Self) is **not the body**; the body is simply a vessel. While the body undergoes changes, aging, and eventually dies, the **Atman** is **eternal**, beyond birth and death.

2. **Ignorance and Misidentification**: Those who believe they are involved in the killing or being killed are **ignorant** of their true nature. The **self** is not subject to physical processes like birth, death, or destruction.

3. **The Importance of Knowledge**: True knowledge (jnana) helps one understand that the **Atman** is unaffected by the activities of the physical world, including birth and death. It is only **through ignorance** (avidya) that people misidentify themselves with their bodies and the physical world.

---

### **Relation to the Overall Theme of the Gita:**

In the larger context of the **Bhagavad Gita**, especially in Chapter 2, Lord Krishna is emphasizing that Arjuna’s sorrow and hesitation are due to his mistaken identification with the **body** rather than the **self**. By understanding that the **Atman** is **eternal**, Arjuna can transcend his emotional turmoil, seeing the situation as one of **duty (dharma)** rather than personal loss.
