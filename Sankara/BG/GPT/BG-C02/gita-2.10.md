### **Sanskrit Text (Bhagavad Gita 1.10)**:

**तमुवाच हृषीकेशः प्रहसन्निव भारत।
सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये विषीदन्तमिदं वचः॥ 10॥**

### **Translation of the Verse**:

**Hṛṣīkeśa (Lord Krishna) spoke these words with a smile, in the middle of the two armies, as Arjuna, full of sorrow, spoke the following words.**

---

### **Commentary Breakdown**:

#### **1. Introduction to the Context of Verse 10**:
The **commentary** begins by situating **Verse 10** within the broader context of the **Bhagavad Gita**, from the moment where **Arjuna** sees the **Pandava army** and is filled with sorrow. This verse is part of the section where **Arjuna** is overwhelmed by grief, realizing the dire consequences of the battle, including the potential destruction of his family and loved ones.

#### **2. Reference to Arjuna's Emotional State**:
The text refers back to **Verse 2** of Chapter 1 (**dṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkam**), where Arjuna first saw the **Pandava army** and became distraught. His emotional turmoil intensifies as he contemplates the loss of his family, friends, and teachers in the war. In the **commentary**, **Arjuna's grief** is presented as the **cause of his dilemma**—he faces the intense conflict between **duty** and **emotional attachments**. His affection for his loved ones, including his **guru** (Drona), **friends**, and family members, causes **sorrow** and **delusion (moha)**, which are the **seeds** of the **cycle of birth and death** (samsara).

#### **3. Arjuna's Grief and Loss of Clarity**:
The grief Arjuna experiences leads to **a loss of clarity (viveka)**, and as a result, he becomes confused about his **duty (dharma)**. In **Verse 4** of Chapter 2 (**kathaṃ bhīṣmamahaṃ saṅkye**), Arjuna questions how he can fight against **Bhishma**, who is his elder and teacher. His grief over the thought of killing his relatives leads him to lose his ability to think clearly. This is a pivotal moment in the Gita, as it sets up the need for Krishna's teachings.

#### **4. Emotional Causes and Consequences**:
The commentary elaborates that **grief** and **delusion** (shoka-moha) distort Arjuna's reasoning. The two primary emotional causes—**grief** and **delusion**—block his **discriminative knowledge** (viveka), which is essential for understanding his **dharma** and how to act in a morally and spiritually correct way. As a result, Arjuna is no longer able to perform his duties as a **warrior** (Kshatriya). His sorrowful attachment leads to confusion, which in turn causes him to retreat from the battlefield, thus abandoning his **duty (swadharma)**.

#### **5. The Need for Self-Knowledge**:
The commentary suggests that the **root causes** of Arjuna's confusion lie in his **attachment** (to family, friends, and teachers) and his **attachment to outcomes** (fruit of the actions). These attachments arise from **ignorance** (avidya) and are **the seeds** of **samsara**. **Renunciation of action** (karma-sannyasa) is suggested as a way to remove these attachments and attain **self-knowledge** (Atma-Jnana), which is the only true solution to these emotional dilemmas.

#### **6. Arjuna as an Example for All Beings**:
Sankara indicates that **Arjuna's predicament** is not just his own but is shared by all beings who are entangled in the **cycle of birth and death** (samsara) due to their own emotional attachments. For beings in this world, there is an inherent **conflict between personal attachments** (to family, friends, etc.) and the performance of their **duty**. Arjuna's situation, while specific to him, symbolizes the **universal struggle** for all humans facing emotional turmoil in the face of duty and spiritual growth.

---

### **Next Steps for Krishna's Teaching**:
To resolve Arjuna's confusion and sorrow, **Krishna**, as **Hṛṣīkeśa** (the controller of the senses), steps in to provide teachings. In **Verse 11** of Chapter 2, Krishna begins his discourse on the **nature of the self** and **duty**. He teaches that Arjuna's sorrow is misplaced and that his attachment to the physical body and the ephemeral nature of life causes this confusion.

#### **Final Note**:
The commentary ends by explaining that Krishna will address **the root causes** of **Arjuna’s emotional and existential suffering**, guiding him to a deeper understanding of the **self** (Atman) and his **role** (dharma) in the world. Krishna's teachings, beginning here, are not only directed at Arjuna but at all beings, helping them transcend the limitations of **grief**, **attachment**, and **delusion**.

---

By breaking down **Verse 10** in this manner, we get a comprehensive understanding of the **context** and **emotional state** of Arjuna and the **philosophical implications** of his suffering, which sets the stage for the teachings of **Krishna** that follow.

### **Translation & Explanation**:

In this part of the commentary, the author addresses a potential objection to the idea of **renouncing all action** as a means to attain **liberation (kaivalya)**. The objection is based on the belief that **self-knowledge** alone, without the performance of any action, cannot lead to liberation.

1. **Objection to Renunciation of All Action**:
Some argue that one cannot attain **kaivalya** (liberation) merely by renouncing all actions and focusing only on **self-knowledge**. They assert that **agnīhotra** (a Vedic ritual) and similar actions, along with **knowledge**, are necessary for liberation, and this is a fixed conclusion in all **Gītā verses**.

2. **Referring to Specific Verses**:
The commentary then cites various verses to refute this objection:
   - **Verse 33 of Chapter 2** (**atha cettvam imaṃ dharmyaṃ saṅgrāmaṃ na kariṣyasi**) warns Arjuna about abandoning his **duty** of war.
   - **Verse 47 of Chapter 2** (**karmaṇyevādhikāraste**) emphasizes that Arjuna has a right to **perform his duties**, specifically the duties of a **warrior** (Kṣatriya).
   - **Verse 15 of Chapter 4** (**kuru karmāiva tasmāt tvam**) encourages Arjuna to perform his duties without attachment to the results.

3. **Addressing the Concern about Vedic Actions**:
The commentary then responds to the concern that Vedic rituals, such as the **agnīhotra**, could be seen as contradictory to the renunciation of action. However, it is clarified that **Vedic rituals** do not necessarily lead to **adharma** (unethical actions), even if they involve **violence** (like animal sacrifice). This concern is addressed by stressing that the **Kshatriya's** duty to fight in the war is **dharma** (righteous), even if it involves harm to others.

4. **Dharma and Violence in Warfare**:
It is clarified that the **violence** involved in the **war** is not unethical (**adharma**), as it is part of **Kṣātra dharma**, the duty of a warrior to protect the realm, even when the act of fighting might involve violence.

5. **Reaffirming the Nature of Dharma**:
The commentary concludes by stressing that the teachings of the **Gītā** do not endorse the idea that violence (even in battle) is **adharma**. It is rather the **duty of the warrior** (Kṣatriya) to fight for justice, and **renouncing this duty** would lead to **moral decline**.

### **Explanation**:

In this portion, the commentary continues to expand upon the relationship between **knowledge (jñāna)** and **action (karma)**, particularly within the frameworks of **Sāṅkhya** and **Yoga**.

1. **Division of Knowledge and Action (Sāṅkhya vs. Yoga)**:
   - The text begins by explaining that the Bhagavad Gita, through the verse "aśocyān" (Bh. Gī. 2.11), and the subsequent discussion on **Arjuna's duty**, indicates a separation between the paths of **knowledge** and **action**. The division of **knowledge (Sāṅkhya)** and **action (Yoga)** is outlined as two distinct yet complementary paths.
   - **Sāṅkhya** knowledge is discussed as the **knowledge of the self** that understands the nature of existence (e.g., the difference between the self and the physical body). This knowledge is linked to the ability to distinguish the eternal self (ātman) from the transient elements (body, mind, etc.).
   - **Yoga** knowledge, by contrast, is more concerned with **practical action**, particularly how one aligns oneself with their duties (dharma) in the world through **self-discipline** and **detachment**.

2. **Distinguishing Sāṅkhya and Yoga**:
   The commentary further clarifies the **practical application** of these two forms of knowledge:
   - **Sāṅkhya** leads to **self-knowledge**, which is necessary for **moksha** (liberation). This is achieved by understanding the essence of the self in relation to worldly actions and experiences.
   - **Yoga** is defined by its focus on **karma (action)**, which in the context of the **Gita**, is specifically **Karma Yoga**, the yoga of action without attachment to the results.

3. **Application to the Vedic Path**:
   The commentator also explains that **Vedic knowledge** leads to different forms of duties, such as supporting family life, performing sacrifices, and upholding **dharmic actions**. However, one must eventually transcend these to seek liberation. The text from **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad (Bṛ. U. 4.4.22)** is invoked to discuss the **transcendence** of ritual action after fulfilling its worldly purposes.

4. **Connection with the Gita's Teachings**:
   The commentary also points out how the **Bhagavad Gita** separates these two forms of knowledge and action. The terms **Sāṅkhya Yoga** and **Karma Yoga** refer to the respective paths that the **Gita** advocates, where **Karma Yoga** is linked to performing one's duties with detachment, and **Sāṅkhya Yoga** emphasizes understanding the nature of reality through insight and knowledge.

### **Explanation of the Passage**:

This portion of the commentary is a response to the **question of Arjuna** in the Bhagavad Gita, specifically his query about the apparent contradiction between **action (karma)** and **knowledge (buddhi)** as presented by Lord Krishna. Arjuna asks, in **Bhagavad Gita 3.1**, why Krishna has advised him to engage in action if **knowledge** is superior to action, as implied in earlier teachings. This passage addresses how this question arises and provides a response.

1. **Arjuna’s Question and the Confusion**:
   The first part of the passage suggests that **Arjuna’s question**, as expressed in **Bhagavad Gita 3.1**, is not valid, based on earlier statements from Krishna regarding the relationship between knowledge and action. Arjuna has misunderstood Krishna's teaching, as he conflates the two. The passage argues that **Arjuna's query**, about why he should engage in **karma (action)** if **buddhi (knowledge)** is superior, is based on a **false assumption** that the two are in contradiction. The **actual teaching** is that knowledge and action, when harmonized properly, form the path to liberation.

2. **The Concept of “Shreya” (the Superior Path)**:
   The commentary touches upon the verse **Bhagavad Gita 5.1**, where Arjuna asks Krishna which path is **superior**, the path of **knowledge (jnana)** or the path of **action (karma)**. It raises the question of whether, when both paths are presented, Arjuna should be asking which path is more appropriate, or if he is misunderstanding the teachings by seeing them as mutually exclusive. The text uses the analogy of a **doctor's prescription** to argue that just as a patient asks for one remedy, in the same way, Arjuna is looking for a singular solution, but Krishna is presenting him with two complementary paths.

3. **Addressing Arjuna’s Confusion**:
   The passage imagines a scenario where Krishna responds to Arjuna’s confusion by stating, **"I have already explained the harmony of knowledge and action"** and asks, **“Why then do you remain confused?”**. This suggests that Krishna has already provided the wisdom that integrates both knowledge and action into a coherent path but that Arjuna is failing to comprehend it properly.

4. **Rejection of Confusion Based on Misunderstanding**:
   The commentary further clarifies that **confusion arises from Arjuna's failure to understand the earlier teachings**. Krishna has already explained that there are **two paths**, and both lead to the same goal of liberation. The path of **Karma Yoga** (action) and the path of **Jnana Yoga** (knowledge) are not contradictory but complementary. The idea of asking for a singular answer between the two is likened to a **false assumption**, where Arjuna is expecting one teaching to be "better" than the other.

5. **Clarification on the Duties of a Kshatriya**:
   The commentary also refutes Arjuna’s idea that engaging in **Karma** is somehow a violation of his **dharma**. It explains that the **Kshatriya** (warrior) duty is inherently a **smārta karma** (ritualistic duty), and therefore Arjuna’s role is to fight as part of his **svadharma** (personal duty). His question, **"Why are you asking me to engage in this terrible action (karma)?"** is considered invalid, as it fails to acknowledge his role as a warrior.

---

### **Summary**:

The passage argues that Arjuna’s question about the superiority of knowledge over action in **Bhagavad Gita 3.1** is based on a misunderstanding of the teachings. The **paths of knowledge (Sāṅkhya Yoga)** and **action (Karma Yoga)** are not in opposition but are rather complementary. Krishna has already explained the necessity of both paths and how they lead to the same end—**liberation**. Furthermore, Arjuna, as a **Kshatriya**, has a duty to fight, and his question about the appropriateness of engaging in war (karma) is invalid.

### **Explanation of the Passage:**

In this section, the commentary discusses the relationship between **action (karma)**, **knowledge (jnana)**, and their **integration** in the path toward **self-realization** and the ultimate **truth (tattva)**. It explains how **karma** is not inherently incompatible with the pursuit of **knowledge** and how actions performed with the right understanding do not bind the individual to worldly desires.

1. **The Incompatibility of Knowledge and Action**:
   The text begins by asserting that it is not possible to reconcile **action** with **self-knowledge (ātmajñāna)** in the manner suggested by the **Gītā** if one assumes that actions alone can lead to **liberation**. While the **Gītā** acknowledges both **action (karma)** and **knowledge (jnana)** as necessary for spiritual development, it also emphasizes that the purification of the intellect and the acquisition of **true knowledge** should ultimately transform one’s relationship to actions, making them non-binding and selfless.

2. **Purification of the Self through Knowledge**:
   The passage mentions that when a person performs actions with the **purification of sattva (the mind’s quality of clarity and goodness)**, the result is **true knowledge** about the **nature of reality**, which includes the understanding that **all is Brahman** and **there is no separate doer**. This realization that **"I am not the doer"** is the central theme of **Vedantic knowledge**. This knowledge transcends **action** and, when attained, makes actions appear to be non-attached (as described in the Gītā).

3. **Action without Attachment**:
   The commentary clarifies that when a person performs actions in line with **dharma** (righteous duty) but with the realization of **non-attachment** and **non-doership**, those actions are not binding, even if they appear to be physically similar to worldly actions. This is expressed in the famous verse of the **Bhagavad Gita (5.7)**, **"kurvannapi na lipyate"**, which means that a person does not accumulate karmic results by performing duties when done in a spirit of detachment and selflessness.

4. **Example of the Kṣatriya’s Duty**:
   To illustrate this point, the commentary discusses the specific **duty of a Kṣatriya (warrior)**, who is expected to engage in warfare as part of their **svadharma** (individual duty). Even though **the action of fighting** may seem violent or harmful, when performed with **selflessness and the right knowledge**, it does not bind the person. In the same way, the **warrior's duty** is not for the **acquisition of material gain** but is an action performed in alignment with the ultimate truth of **Brahman** and **dharma**.

5. **Disassociation from the Results of Actions**:
   The passage then provides an example to explain this principle: a person may perform ritual actions like the **Agnihotra** sacrifice, which are typically aimed at material rewards (such as attaining heaven). However, even if one performs such actions, they are not for the purpose of personal gain. The ritual becomes an act of **selfless service** when the doer realizes that the action is not for their **personal benefit** but as an offering to the divine order.

6. **The Bhagavad Gita's Message**:
   Finally, the passage concludes by reinforcing the **Bhagavad Gita's teachings** that actions are not inherently binding when performed with the right attitude. The individual who is **detached** and **knowledgeable** does not accrue the karmic results of their actions. The verses **5.7** and **13.31** emphasize that **performing actions without attachment** is essential for spiritual progress and liberation.

---

### **Summary:**

This passage elaborates on the **integration of action and knowledge** in spiritual practice, arguing that true **knowledge** transforms how one engages in the world. When a person performs actions with the understanding of their non-attached nature and their alignment with the divine will, those actions do not bind them to the cycle of birth and death. The idea that **"I am not the doer"** and **"all is Brahman"** is key to realizing liberation, and this concept is central to the **Bhagavad Gita**. **Karma**, when performed with the right attitude, is no longer binding but becomes an expression of the divine **dharma**.

### **Explanation of the Passage:**

This section delves deeper into the relationship between **action (karma)** and **self-realization (tattvajnana)**, offering a nuanced interpretation of **karma yoga** and **jnana yoga** as presented in the **Bhagavad Gita**.

1. **Clarification of the Verse: 'Pūrvaiḥ pūrvataraṃ kṛtam'** (Bh. Gī. 4.15):
   The verse speaks about how actions that were previously performed by great individuals like **Janaka** and others (who are often referred to as enlightened rulers) lead to **spiritual accomplishment**. The passage clarifies that these actions, though performed in the world, are **not done with attachment** to the results but rather in the spirit of **selfless duty**. The important aspect of their actions is the realization that **action** is a tool for **purification** and **attainment of knowledge**, and not an end in itself.

2. **The Relationship Between Karma and Jnana**:
   - The text questions whether the **knowledge (tattvajnana)** that these individuals possess makes their **actions** in the world different from ordinary actions. The answer is that even though their actions align with worldly duties (like **Janaka** performing the duties of a king), they are still **attached to knowledge**, which purifies their mind (sattvashuddhi).
   - The phrase **‘guṇā guṇeṣu vartante’** (Bh. Gī. 3.28) is referenced here to explain that even while engaged in worldly activities, these great figures remain detached from the fruits of their actions, because they understand that the **modes of nature (guṇas)** operate in all activities, and they are **not the doers**.

3. **Karma-Yoga and Jnana-Yoga Integration**:
   The passage clarifies that **karma-yoga** and **jnana-yoga** are **not mutually exclusive**. Although these figures perform actions, they do so in **alignment with the divine will** and without attachment. They perform duties to uphold the **cosmic order**, and their actions are **sanctified** by the realization that the **self (Atman)** is distinct from the actions performed. This is why they achieve both **perfection (siddhi)** and **knowledge (jnana)** simultaneously.

4. **The Key Idea in Bhagavad Gita's Teachings**:
   - Bhagavan **Krishna** explicitly addresses this principle in verses like **Bh. Gī. 5.11** and **Bh. Gī. 18.46**, asserting that **purification** (sattvashuddhi) comes through action, and it is through **selfless action** that one attains **perfection**.
   - He emphasizes that through performing one’s **prescribed duty (svadharma)**, a person can attain **perfection** (siddhi), not by renouncing actions but by dedicating them to the higher purpose of self-realization.
   - In **Bh. Gī. 18.50**, Krishna states that the **attainment of perfection** leads to **union with the absolute Brahman**, highlighting that action, when done in alignment with divine knowledge, leads to **liberation (moksha)**.

5. **Conclusion - Knowledge vs. Action in the Gita**:
   The passage concludes by reinforcing the idea that **moksha** (liberation) is **not attained solely through renunciation** of action (karma-sannyasa), but rather through the integration of **knowledge (tattvajnana)** with selfless action. The enlightened beings (like Janaka) did not abandon their actions but performed them in the service of **dharma** and **spiritual progression**. Therefore, the idea that **knowledge alone leads to liberation** is correct, but this knowledge transforms how one engages with actions. It is the realization of **non-doership** and the **purification of the mind** through **action** that results in liberation.

### **Summary:**

This passage addresses the profound relationship between **karma** (action) and **jnana** (knowledge) in the **Bhagavad Gita**, emphasizing that **selfless action**, when combined with the realization of **the true nature of the self (Atman)**, leads to both **spiritual perfection** and **liberation**. It makes clear that knowledge does not require renouncing actions but requires the performance of duties in alignment with **divine will** and **selfless devotion**. Ultimately, the passage asserts that **moksha** comes through the realization that the self is separate from actions, and thus one is not bound by them.
