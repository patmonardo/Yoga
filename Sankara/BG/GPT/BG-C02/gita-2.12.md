**Explanation of the Passage:**

This verse, **Bhagavad Gita 2.12**, is part of Lord Krishna's response to **Arjuna's grief**. Krishna now introduces a deeper philosophical insight into the **eternal nature of the soul** (Atman) and the **impermanence of the physical body**. Let's break down the verse and understand its meaning in context.

---

1. **“Na tvevāhaṃ jātu nāsaṃ”** —
   "I was never non-existent at any time."
   Krishna begins by emphasizing that **the soul** (Atman) is **eternal** and has **always existed**. He states that **He**, as the eternal truth, has never been absent or non-existent. There is a distinction between the **eternal soul** and the **temporary body**. The body undergoes **birth and death**, but the **soul** itself is never subject to these transformations.

2. **“Na tvaṃ neme janādhipāḥ”** —
   "Nor have you (Arjuna) ever not been; nor have these kings ever not been."
   Krishna then applies the same logic to **Arjuna** and the **other kings** who are part of the war. They, too, are **eternal** in essence. What Krishna is pointing to is that while their bodies will **perish**, their **true essence** (the soul) is **imperishable** and has always existed. This applies to everyone, as the soul is not bound by the physical form.

3. **“Na caiva na bhaviṣyāmaḥ”** —
   "Nor shall we ever cease to be in the future."
   Krishna affirms that not only have they **always existed**, but they also **always will exist**. Even when the body dies, the soul is **immortal** and will continue in some form, which could be a different body or another state of existence. The soul's nature transcends the cycle of birth and death, and it is beyond the limits of time.

4. **“Sarve vayamatastaḥ param”** —
   "All of us (Arjuna and others) will exist beyond the death of the body, beyond this world."
   Krishna reaffirms the **eternity of the soul** beyond the physical realm and **time**. He emphasizes that death does not mark the **end of the soul**; the soul continues its journey, free from the constraints of the physical body. This means the soul will exist even after the **death of the body**, in a state that transcends both **life** and **death**.

---

### **Philosophical Significance:**

Krishna's teachings here point to a critical **Vedantic** concept: the **eternity of the soul (Atman)**. In the **Bhagavad Gita**, the soul is presented as **unchanging**, **immortal**, and **beyond the physical realm** of **life and death**. The physical body is transient and impermanent, but the **self** (Atman) is eternal and indestructible.

---

### **Deeper Analysis of the Verse:**

1. **Atman’s Eternal Nature (Nitya):**
   Krishna uses the phrase **“nityāḥ”** (eternal) to underscore the **imperishability of the soul**. The essence of every being is **timeless** and **constant**, unaffected by the transient nature of the material world. This teaching aligns with the **Vedantic** view that the **true self (Atman)** is not bound by **time** or **space**.

2. **The Illusion of Death:**
   The teaching of **death** in this verse seeks to **dissolve Arjuna's grief** by pointing out the **illusory nature of death**. What Arjuna perceives as death is merely the **end of the body**—but the **soul** (Atman) cannot die. It only changes form or passes from one state of existence to another. The **material body** may disintegrate, but the **soul** continues.

3. **The Impermanence of the Physical Body:**
   Krishna emphasizes that **death** pertains only to the **body** and not the soul. This aligns with the core teaching of **Vedanta**, where the soul (Atman) is considered **immutable**, while the body is **temporary** and **perishable**. The body undergoes birth, decay, and death, but the **Atman remains unaffected by these processes**.

---

### **Key Takeaway:**

In this verse, **Lord Krishna** teaches **Arjuna** that the true **Self (Atman)** is beyond birth and death. **Arjuna’s grief** arises from his **attachment** to the body and his inability to recognize the **eternal nature** of the soul. Krishna urges Arjuna to detach himself from the **illusion of death** and to recognize that the **soul** is **eternal**, always existing in past, present, and future.

This verse also reinforces the idea that **everything in this material world is transient**, and only the **Self** (Atman) is **constant**. Krishna’s words encourage **detachment** from the physical realm and an understanding of the **higher, eternal truth** that transcends birth, death, and time.
