# Technical Analysis Artifact: Bhagavad Gītā 2.72

### I. Mūla Verse

**Sanskrit**
```markdown
एषा ब्राह्मी स्थितिः पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति ।
स्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ॥ ७२ ॥
```

**Transliteration**
```markdown
eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha naināṃ prāpya vimuhyati |
sthitvāsyām antakāle ’pi brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati || 72 ||
```

**Translation**
"This is the Brahman-state, O Pārtha. Attaining it, one is never deluded. Even abiding in it at the final moment, one attains Brahman-nirvāṇa (liberation)."

### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

**Key Sanskrit Excerpts (Provided Text)**
```markdown
एषा ... ब्राह्मी स्थितिः ... ब्रह्मणि भवा ...
न एनां स्थितिं प्राप्य विमुह्यति ...
स्थित्वा अस्यां ... अन्तकालेऽपि ... ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ...
```

**Key Points from the Bhāṣya**:
- Śaṅkara describes this “Brahmī sthitiḥ” (the Brahman-state) as the culmination of all the teachings presented: a state wherein one renounces all action and resides in Brahman alone, fully established in the Self.
- Having realized this state, one never falls back into delusion (no more confusion or identification with transient phenomena).
- Even if one attains this state at the end of life (antakāle), one achieves Brahman-nirvāṇa—ultimate liberation.
- While the verse explicitly mentions the end of life, Śaṅkara implies that abiding in Brahman-consciousness at any time ensures eventual liberation, underscoring the completeness and finality of this realization.

### III. Term Analysis

- **ब्राह्मी स्थितिः (brāhmī sthitiḥ)**:
  *Meaning*: The state of being established in Brahman.
  *Contextual Significance*: It is the apex of spiritual achievement described in chapter 2—the mind fully stabilized in non-dual awareness, free of desires, ego, and ignorance. This state is the idealized “sthita-prajña” condition, representing perfect self-knowledge and unwavering peace.

- **न विमुह्यति (na vimuhyati)**:
  *Meaning*: Does not become deluded.
  *Contextual Significance*: Delusion arises from misidentification with body, senses, and external objects. In the Brahman-state, all such delusions vanish. There is no return to ignorance once this knowledge is firmly established.

- **अन्तकाले (antakāle)**:
  *Meaning*: At the end of life.
  *Contextual Significance*: Even if this realization is attained late—at the final moment—it grants liberation. This emphasizes the immediacy and power of authentic knowledge: once gained, it irreversibly secures one’s freedom.

- **ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं (brahma-nirvāṇam)**:
  *Meaning*: Merging in or attaining the highest reality, synonymous with mokṣa or final liberation.
  *Contextual Significance*: Nirvāṇa here conveys the end of all conditioned existence. Attaining Brahman-nirvāṇa means the cessation of saṃsāra’s cycle and resting eternally in the non-dual Self.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: Earlier in the chapter, the practitioner struggles with desires, ego, and sensory entanglements, attempting to establish steady discernment and inner stability.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: Through disciplined understanding, sense-control, removal of ego, and realization of the Self’s true nature, the practitioner ascends to Brahmī sthitiḥ, the state of unwavering knowledge of Brahman.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: The final concept is that this Brahman-state is ultimate. Once realized, no further delusion is possible, and at life’s end, one seamlessly transitions into Brahman-nirvāṇa. This underscores the end-goal of spiritual practice described in chapter 2: complete emancipation from ignorance and suffering, culminating in eternal peace.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Progression from Empirical to Transcendental**: Philosophically, chapter 2 guided us from struggles with senses and desires to a transcendental state beyond conceptual mediation. The rational discourse and experiential yogic disciplines lead to a realization that surpasses ordinary knowing, establishing one in pure Self-awareness.

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: Brahmī sthitiḥ represents stable abiding in non-dual reality. Once there, the dualistic illusions that prompted action and craving evaporate. The Self rests as the sole truth, immune to confusion or fragmentation.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: As in Buddhism, where final awakening ensures no return to delusion or saṃsāra, here too the culmination is a stable, irreversible realization. Yoga practices (pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna, samādhi) and Vedāntic insight converge, revealing the Self as Brahman. Achieving this parallels liberation in both systems—a complete freedom from ignorance and rebirth.

- **Dhyāna and Samādhi’s Fulfillment**: Having cultivated concentration and insight, the seeker’s dhāraṇā matures into dhyāna and samādhi. In samādhi, distinctions disappear, leaving only Brahman awareness. The text’s conclusion shows that dhāraṇā and meditative absorption are not ends in themselves but gateways to stable Self-realization and ultimate liberation.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: The final verse ties together chapter 2’s teachings, affirming that stable establishment in Brahman ensures liberation. Non-dual insight removes the possibility of ignorance re-emerging. This is the Advaita vision of mokṣa: a state where the notion of returning to bondage does not arise.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: In Abhidharma terms, once the defilements are eradicated at their root through insight, no conditions remain for future bondage. Similarly, once Brahmī sthitiḥ is attained, all karmic impulses driven by ignorance cease, and thus, brahma-nirvāṇa stands secure.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.72 concludes the Gītā’s second chapter by revealing the end-goal of spiritual practice: a state of non-dual clarity free from all delusion, guaranteeing liberation. The complex interplay of Yogic disciplines, Vedāntic insight, and elimination of desires and ego culminates here.

- **Significance for the Practitioner**: This confirms that the entire sādhanā (spiritual endeavor) described leads to a permanent transformation—once this state is realized, fear of falling back into ignorance does not persist. Abiding in Brahman, one attains the highest peace and freedom.

# Conclusion

Bhagavad Gītā 2.72 concludes the chapter by celebrating the Brahman-state (brāhmī sthitiḥ) as the highest realization, assuring that attaining it dispels all delusion and ensures liberation at life’s end. Śaṅkara’s commentary reinforces that abiding in Brahman, devoid of desires and ego, represents the ultimate spiritual fulfillment. This final verse synthesizes the chapter’s teachings, linking the internal disciplines and insights discussed to the promise of final, irrevocable freedom—Brahman-nirvāṇa.
