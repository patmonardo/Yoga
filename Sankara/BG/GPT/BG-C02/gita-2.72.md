**Translation**

*"This, as described, is the Brahmī state—dwelling exclusively in Brahman after renouncing all actions. O Partha, having attained this state, one does not become deluded or fall into attachment. Remaining in this Brahmī state even at the time of death, and even at the end of one's life, one attains Brahman-immortality and liberation. What else can be said? One who solely practices Brahmacharya and abides in Brahman alone attains Brahman-immortality."*
