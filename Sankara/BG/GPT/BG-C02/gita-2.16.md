## **II. Brief Analysis of Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya**

### **Connecting to the Previous Teaching**

Śaṅkara begins by linking this verse to the preceding discussion on enduring the dualities of life without succumbing to grief and delusion:

"Therefore, without giving way to grief and delusion, it is appropriate to endure heat and cold, etc., because..."

### **Commentary on the Verse**

- **न असतः अविद्यमानस्य शीतोष्णादेः सकारणस्य न विद्यते नास्ति भावः भवन् अस्तिता।**

  "Of the unreal (*asat*), which is non-existent and includes things like heat and cold that are effects with causes, there is no *bhāva*—no real existence."

### **Key Points from the Bhāṣya**

1. **असत् (Asat)**: *The Unreal or Non-existent*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to phenomena that are transient and dependent on causes, such as sensory experiences of heat and cold.
   - **Context**: These experiences are impermanent and do not have true existence from the standpoint of ultimate reality.

2. **सत् (Sat)**: *The Real or Existent*

   - **Explanation**: Denotes the eternal, unchanging reality—the Self or Brahman—that always exists and never ceases to be.
   - **Context**: This is the ultimate truth that underlies all appearances.

3. **भावः (Bhāvaḥ)**: *Being or Existence*

   - **Explanation**: True existence that is independent and unchanging.
   - **Context**: Only *sat* (the real) possesses this true existence.

4. **न विद्यते (Na Vidyate)**: *Does Not Exist*

   - **Explanation**: Indicates the absence of true existence in the unreal.
   - **Context**: Emphasizes that transient phenomena do not have ultimate reality.

5. **तत्त्वदर्शिभिः (Tattva-darśibhiḥ)**: *Seers of the Essence*

   - **Explanation**: Enlightened beings who perceive the true nature of reality.
   - **Context**: They have discerned the difference between the real and the unreal.

### **Understanding the Dialectic of Sat and Asat**

- **Sat (Being)**: The eternal, unchanging reality that is the true Self. It is ever-existent and not subject to change or destruction.

- **Asat (Non-being)**: The impermanent, changing phenomena of the material world, including sensory experiences and physical forms.

- **Dialectical Relationship**: Recognizing that the unreal does not have true existence and the real never ceases to exist helps one transcend grief and delusion.

### **Implications for Practice**

- **Enduring Dualities**: By understanding the transient nature of sensory experiences (asat), one can endure them without being disturbed.

- **Seeking the Real**: Focusing on the eternal Self (sat) leads to true knowledge and liberation.

- **Wisdom of the Seers**: Following the insights of the enlightened helps in discerning reality from illusion.

### **Transliteration**

**nā́sato vidyate bhā́vo nā́bhāvo vidyate sataḥ |
ubhayór api dṛṣṭó 'ntás tv anayos tattva-darśibhiḥ || 2.16 ||**

### **Translation**

---

## **II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya Analysis**

### **Segment Translation**

**Objection**: "If (objects like the pot are) unreal, then there would be the consequence of total non-existence of everything."

**Answer**: "No; because everywhere two cognitions are perceived—cognition of existence (sat-buddhi) and cognition of non-existence (asat-buddhi)."

"That object, about which cognition does not deviate, is the real (sat); that object, about which cognition deviates, is the unreal (asat). Thus, the division between the real and the unreal is based on cognition. Everywhere, these two cognitions are perceived by all in the same substratum, not like 'blue lotus' (where blue and lotus are separate attributes). For example: 'existent pot,' 'existent cloth,' 'existent elephant,' etc."

"Thus, everywhere, of these two cognitions, the cognition of pot, etc., is variable (vyabhicarati). This has been demonstrated. But the cognition of existence does not vary. Therefore, objects like the pot, which are the subjects of variable cognition, are unreal due to their variability; but the subject of the cognition of existence is not unreal, due to its invariability."

---

### **Term Analysis**

#### **1. तदसत्त्वे सर्वाभावप्रसङ्ग इति चेत् (tad-asattve sarva-abhāva-prasaṅga iti cet)**: *"If it is unreal, then the consequence would be total non-existence of everything."*

- **Explanation**: An anticipated objection that declaring objects as unreal leads to nihilism or the denial of all existence.

#### **2. बुद्धिद्वय (buddhi-dvaya)**: *Two cognitions*

- **Explanation**: The dual perceptions of existence (sat-buddhi) and specific objects (e.g., pot-cognition).

#### **3. सद्बुद्धि (sat-buddhi)**: *Cognition of existence*

- **Explanation**: The unchanging awareness of 'is-ness' or being that accompanies all perceptions.

#### **4. असद्बुद्धि (asad-buddhi)**: *Cognition of non-existence or variable cognition*

- **Explanation**: The changing awareness of specific forms or objects that are transient.

#### **5. व्यभिचार (vyabhicāra)**: *Deviation or variability*

- **Explanation**: The tendency of an object or cognition to change, appear, or disappear.

#### **6. समानाधिकरण (samānādhikaraṇa)**: *Same substratum or locus*

- **Explanation**: The coexistence of two cognitions (existence and object) in the same entity.

#### **7. न नीलोत्पलवत् (na nīlotpalavat)**: *Not like a blue lotus*

- **Explanation**: Unlike the 'blue lotus,' where 'blue' and 'lotus' are distinct but perceived together, the cognitions of existence and object are inseparable in the same substratum.

#### **8. अव्यभिचार (avyabhicāra)**: *Non-deviation or invariability*

- **Explanation**: The constant, unchanging aspect of cognition, referring to the perception of existence.

---

### **Dialectical Analysis**

#### **1. Anticipated Objection**

- **Objection**: If objects like pots are declared unreal, it implies that nothing exists (*sarva-abhāva*), leading to a nihilistic conclusion.

#### **2. Śaṅkara's Rebuttal**

- **Existence of Two Cognitions**: We always experience two cognitions together—the constant cognition of existence (sat-buddhi) and the variable cognition of specific objects (asad-buddhi).

- **Distinction Based on Cognition**: The division between real and unreal is established through the presence or absence of variability in cognition.

#### **3. Criteria for Reality and Unreality**

- **Real (Sat)**: That which is accompanied by an invariable cognition—existence that does not change.

- **Unreal (Asat)**: That which is accompanied by variable cognition—the specific forms that appear and disappear.

#### **4. Examples Illustrating the Concept**

- **Expressions Used**: 'Existent pot,' 'existent cloth,' 'existent elephant'—in all these, 'existent' is constant, while the object varies.

- **Sameness of Substratum**: Both cognitions occur in the same substratum (the object), unlike 'blue lotus,' where 'blue' and 'lotus' can be considered separately.

#### **5. Variability of Object Cognition**

- **Variable Cognition of Objects**: The perception of specific objects like pot or cloth changes—they can be present or absent.

- **Invariable Cognition of Existence**: The awareness of existence remains constant, regardless of the object perceived.

#### **6. Conclusion Drawn**

- **Objects as Unreal**: Objects are considered unreal because their cognition is variable—they do not have independent, unchanging existence.

- **Existence as Real**: Existence itself is real because its cognition is invariable—it is always present in every perception.

---

### **Philosophical Implications**

#### **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Reality of Brahman**: The ultimate reality is Brahman, the unchanging existence that underlies all phenomena.

- **Mithyā (Illusory Nature of Phenomena)**: Objects and forms are considered mithyā—they appear to exist but do not have absolute reality.

- **Role of Cognition**: Cognition is the means by which we can discern the real from the unreal; what is unchanging in cognition is real.

#### **Understanding the Nature of Existence**

- **Invariable Existence**: Existence (sat) is constant and unchanging across all experiences and perceptions.

- **Variable Forms**: Objects (nama-rupa) are variable and transient, lacking independent reality.

---

### **Application to Spiritual Practice**

#### **Cultivating Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Discerning the Real**: Practice distinguishing between the unchanging existence and the changing forms.

- **Focusing on the Eternal**: Direct attention towards the constant presence of existence in all experiences.

#### **Developing Non-Attachment**

- **Letting Go of the Unreal**: Recognize that attachment to transient objects leads to ignorance and suffering.

- **Anchoring in the Real**: Establish oneself in the awareness of unchanging existence.

#### **Overcoming Delusion**

- **Avoiding Nihilism**: Understanding that declaring objects as unreal does not negate existence but refines our perception of what is truly real.

- **Embracing the Unchanging Self**: Realize that one's true nature is the unchanging existence, not the transient forms.

---

## **III. Summary**

Śaṅkara addresses a potential misunderstanding that declaring objects as unreal leads to the conclusion that nothing exists. He clarifies that while the specific forms (objects) are unreal due to their variable cognition, existence itself is real because it is constantly perceived without deviation. This distinction is crucial in Advaita Vedānta for understanding the nature of reality and progressing on the spiritual path. By focusing on the unchanging existence and recognizing the transient nature of forms, one moves closer to realizing the Self and attaining liberation.

---

## **IV. Next Steps**

- **Deepen Understanding**: Reflect on the constant presence of existence in all experiences.

- **Practice Discrimination**: Observe how specific perceptions change while the sense of 'being' remains the same.

- **Meditate on Existence**: Engage in meditation focusing on the pure sense of existence beyond forms.

## **I. Contextual Introduction**

In this segment, Śaṅkara continues his analysis of the distinction between the real (*sat*) and the unreal (*asat*) by addressing a potential objection regarding the variability of the cognition of existence (*sadbuddhi*). He clarifies how the cognition of existence remains constant even when specific objects cease to exist, reinforcing the argument that only the underlying existence is real, while the forms are transient and unreal.

---

## **II. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**Objection**:

*"When the pot is destroyed and the cognition of the pot ceases (i.e., the cognition of the pot varies), then the cognition of existence (*sadbuddhi*) also varies. Therefore, the cognition of existence is also variable."*

**Answer**:

*"No; because the cognition of existence is observed even in the cloth and other objects. That cognition of existence is indeed related only to the attribute (*viśeṣaṇa-viṣayā eva sā sadbuddhiḥ*)."*

---

## **III. Term Analysis**

### **Key Terms from Bhāṣya:**

1. **घटे विनष्टे (ghaṭe vinaṣṭe)**: *When the pot is destroyed*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to the cessation of the physical form of the pot.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Highlights the transient nature of specific objects.

2. **घटबुद्धौ व्यभिचरन्त्यां (ghaṭa-buddhau vyabhicarantyām)**: *When the cognition of the pot varies or ceases*

   - **Explanation**: The perception or awareness of the pot no longer exists when the pot is destroyed.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Illustrates the variability of object-specific cognition.

3. **सद्बुद्धिः (sadbuddhiḥ)**: *Cognition of existence*

   - **Explanation**: The awareness or perception of 'is-ness' or existence that accompanies all objects.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Considered invariable and constant across different objects.

4. **व्यभिचरति (vyabhicarati)**: *Varies or deviates*

   - **Explanation**: Indicates change, inconsistency, or cessation in cognition.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Used to distinguish between variable object cognition and invariable existence cognition.

5. **पटादौ अपि (paṭādau api)**: *Even in the cloth and other objects*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to other objects that continue to exist when the pot is destroyed.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Demonstrates that the cognition of existence persists in other objects.

6. **सद्बुद्धिदर्शनात् (sadbuddhi-darśanāt)**: *Because of the observation of the cognition of existence*

   - **Explanation**: The continuous perception of existence in other objects.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Supports the argument that sadbuddhi does not vary.

7. **विशेषणविषया एव सा सद्बुद्धिः (viśeṣaṇa-viṣayā eva sā sadbuddhiḥ)**: *That cognition of existence is indeed related only to the attribute*

   - **Explanation**: The cognition of existence pertains to the general attribute of 'being' rather than to specific objects.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Emphasizes that existence is an inherent attribute perceived in all objects, not tied to any particular form.

---

## **IV. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. The Objection Explained**

- **Objection Raised**:

  - When a specific object like a pot is destroyed, the cognition of that pot ceases (*ghaṭabuddhau vyabhicarantyām*).
  - Consequently, the cognition of existence (*sadbuddhi*) associated with the pot also seems to cease.
  - Therefore, it appears that sadbuddhi is also variable and not invariable as previously asserted.

### **2. Śaṅkara's Response**

- **Rebuttal**:

  - **Persistence of Sadbuddhi**:

    - Even when the pot is destroyed, the cognition of existence does not cease because it is observed in other objects like the cloth (*paṭa*) and so on.
    - The awareness of existence continues unbroken in other existing objects.

  - **Sadbuddhi Relates to the Attribute**:

    - The cognition of existence is related to the attribute of 'being' (*viśeṣaṇa-viṣayā*) and not confined to any specific object.
    - Existence is an inherent attribute that is perceived universally across all objects.

### **3. Clarifying the Nature of Sadbuddhi**

- **Invariability of Sadbuddhi**:

  - Sadbuddhi does not vary because it is not dependent on any single object.
  - While the specific object cognition (e.g., pot cognition) is variable and ceases when the object is destroyed, the cognition of existence persists in other objects.

- **Existence as an Attribute**:

  - Existence is an attribute that qualifies all objects.
  - The cognition of existence is, therefore, constant and invariable, as it is always associated with some existing object.

### **4. Implications of the Analysis**

- **Objects are Variable; Existence is Constant**:

  - Specific objects come and go, but existence as an attribute remains constant.
  - This supports the argument that objects are unreal (asat) due to their variability, while existence is real (sat) due to its invariability.

- **No Cessation of Sadbuddhi**:

  - The cessation of a particular object's existence does not imply the cessation of existence itself.
  - Existence continues to be cognized in other forms and objects.

---

## **V. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Existence (Sat) as the Fundamental Reality**:

  - Existence is the fundamental reality that underlies all objects and phenomena.
  - It is unchanging, constant, and perceived universally.

- **Objects (Asat) as Transient Forms**:

  - Objects are transient and subject to change; they do not possess independent existence.
  - They are superimpositions upon the underlying reality of existence.

### **2. Cognition as a Means to Discern Reality**

- **Role of Cognition**:

  - Cognition helps us discern between the real and the unreal.
  - The invariable cognition of existence indicates the presence of the real.

- **Attribute vs. Substance**:

  - Existence is an attribute that qualifies all objects, not confined to any single substance.
  - Understanding this helps in recognizing the constant amidst the variable.

### **3. Refuting Nihilism**

- **No Total Non-Existence**:

  - The destruction of specific objects does not lead to total non-existence.
  - Existence persists and is cognized in other objects, refuting the idea of universal non-existence.

- **Continuity of Existence**:

  - The continuity of sadbuddhi ensures that reality is continuous and unbroken, despite the changing forms.

---

## **VI. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Developing Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Recognizing the Invariable**:

  - Focus on the constant cognition of existence amidst changing objects.
  - Train the mind to distinguish between the unchanging reality and the transient forms.

- **Shifting Perspective**:

  - Move from an object-centered perception to an existence-centered perception.
  - See existence as the common thread in all experiences.

### **2. Cultivating Detachment (Vairāgya)**

- **Letting Go of Attachment to Forms**:

  - Understand that attachment to specific objects is futile due to their transient nature.
  - Cultivate detachment by recognizing the impermanence of forms.

- **Anchoring in the Real**:

  - Anchor consciousness in the awareness of existence, which is constant and reliable.
  - This anchoring leads to inner stability and peace.

### **3. Overcoming Fear of Loss**

- **Acceptance of Change**:

  - Accept that objects will come and go, but existence remains.
  - This acceptance reduces fear and anxiety associated with loss.

- **Trust in the Underlying Reality**:

  - Develop trust in the unchanging reality that underlies all phenomena.
  - This trust fosters resilience and equanimity in the face of change.

---

## **VII. Summary**

In this segment, Śaṅkara addresses the objection that the cognition of existence (*sadbuddhi*) also varies when a specific object is destroyed. He clarifies that while the cognition of the object (e.g., pot) ceases upon its destruction, the cognition of existence does not cease because it continues to be perceived in other objects like the cloth. This cognition of existence is related to the attribute of 'being' and is invariable, whereas the cognition of specific objects is variable.

This analysis reinforces the Advaita Vedānta view that existence is the only constant reality, and objects are transient forms superimposed upon it. By recognizing the constancy of existence and the variability of forms, one can cultivate discrimination and detachment, essential qualities for spiritual growth and the realization of the Self.

---

## **VIII. Next Steps**

- **Deepen Contemplation**:

  - Reflect on how the cognition of existence persists despite the changing forms.
  - Meditate on existence as the unchanging reality.

- **Apply in Daily Life**:

  - Observe how attachment to specific objects leads to suffering.
  - Practice shifting focus from transient objects to the underlying existence.

- **Study Further**:

  - Continue exploring Śaṅkara's commentary to gain a deeper understanding of the principles of Advaita Vedānta.
  - Examine how this understanding helps in overcoming grief and delusion.

## **I. Contextual Introduction**

In this segment, Śaṅkara continues the discussion on the variability and invariability of cognitions related to objects (*ghaṭa-buddhi* or pot cognition) and existence (*sat-buddhi* or cognition of existence). He addresses a further objection that challenges his previous assertion that the cognition of existence is invariable while the cognition of specific objects is variable. The objection claims that just as the cognition of existence is seen in all instances of existence, the cognition of a pot is also seen in other pots, suggesting that it too is invariable.

---

## **II. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**Objection**:

*"Just as the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*), so too the cognition of the pot (*ghaṭa-buddhi*) is also seen in another pot."*

**Answer**:

*"No; because it is not seen in the cloth and other things."*

---

## **III. Term Analysis**

### **Key Terms from the Bhāṣya:**

1. **सद्बुद्धि (sat-buddhi)**: *Cognition of existence*

   - **Explanation**: The unchanging awareness of 'existence' or 'being' that accompanies all perceptions.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Previously established as invariable and constant across different objects.

2. **घटबुद्धि (ghaṭa-buddhi)**: *Cognition of the pot*

   - **Explanation**: The specific perception or awareness of a pot.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Considered variable as it ceases when the pot is destroyed.

3. **घटान्तरे (ghaṭāntare)**: *In another pot*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to a different pot or another instance of a pot.
   - **Contextual Significance**: The objection points out that the cognition of the pot persists in other pots.

4. **दृश्यते (dṛśyate)**: *Is seen or perceived*

   - **Explanation**: The act of perceiving or observing.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Indicates that the cognition continues in similar objects.

5. **इति चेत् (iti cet)**: *If it is so said*

   - **Explanation**: Introduces an objection or hypothetical statement.

6. **न (na)**: *No*

   - **Explanation**: Denial or negation.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Śaṅkara's response to the objection.

7. **पटादौ (paṭa-ādau)**: *In cloth and other things*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to other objects like cloth, which are different from the pot.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Used to demonstrate that the pot cognition does not occur in dissimilar objects.

8. **अदर्शनात् (adarśanāt)**: *Due to non-perception*

   - **Explanation**: The absence of perception or observation.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Indicates that the cognition of the pot is not seen in objects other than pots.

---

## **IV. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. The Objection Explained**

- **Assertion**:

  - The objector argues that the cognition of the pot (*ghaṭa-buddhi*) is also invariable because it is observed in another pot (*ghaṭāntare*).
  - Just as the cognition of existence persists across different objects, the cognition of the pot persists across different pots.
  - Therefore, the pot cognition should be considered invariable, challenging the previous claim that it is variable.

### **2. Śaṅkara's Response**

- **Refutation**:

  - Śaṅkara responds with a firm "No" (*na*), indicating disagreement with the objection.
  - He explains that the pot cognition is not observed in objects like cloth and others (*paṭādau*), which are different from the pot.
  - The cognition of the pot does not extend to dissimilar objects; it is limited to pots only.

### **3. Clarifying the Variability of Pot Cognition**

- **Specificity of Object Cognition**:

  - The cognition of the pot is specific to pots and does not occur when perceiving other objects like cloth.
  - Therefore, it is variable because it is absent when the pot is not present or when perceiving different objects.

- **Invariability of Existence Cognition**:

  - In contrast, the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*) is present in all objects, including pots, cloth, and others.
  - This universality makes the cognition of existence invariable and constant.

### **4. Establishing the Distinction**

- **Pot Cognition is Variable**:

  - Since the pot cognition does not occur in all objects and is limited to pots, it is considered variable (*vyabhicāri*).
  - Its variability confirms that objects like the pot are unreal (asat) due to their transient and limited nature.

- **Existence Cognition is Invariable**:

  - The cognition of existence is perceived universally across all objects without exception.
  - Its invariability affirms that existence (sat) is real and the underlying reality of all phenomena.

---

## **V. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Universality vs. Specificity**:

  - **Existence (Sat)**: Universal, unchanging, and perceived in all objects; thus, it is real.
  - **Objects (Asat)**: Specific, changing, and not perceived universally; thus, they are unreal.

- **Understanding Reality**:

  - Reality is attributed to that which is constant and unchanging.
  - The specific forms and names are transient and lack independent existence.

### **2. Role of Cognition in Determining Reality**

- **Invariable Cognition**:

  - The invariable cognition indicates an underlying reality that does not change with circumstances.
  - Existence cognition fits this criterion and is thus associated with reality.

- **Variable Cognition**:

  - Variable cognition depends on specific conditions and objects.
  - Since it is not constant, it indicates the unreality of the object it pertains to.

---

## **VI. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Developing Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Recognizing the Invariable**:

  - Focus on the unchanging aspect of cognition—the awareness of existence.
  - Understand that specific object cognitions are limited and variable.

- **Seeing Beyond Forms**:

  - Train the mind to perceive the underlying existence in all forms.
  - This practice helps in transcending attachment to specific objects.

### **2. Cultivating Detachment (Vairāgya)**

- **Detachment from Specific Objects**:

  - Recognize that attachment to specific forms like pots, cloths, etc., leads to suffering due to their impermanence.
  - Develop detachment by understanding their transient nature.

- **Anchoring in the Eternal**:

  - Anchor your awareness in the unchanging existence that underlies all objects.
  - This anchoring provides stability and peace amidst the changing phenomena.

---

## **VII. Summary**

In this segment, Śaṅkara addresses an objection that the cognition of the pot might also be considered invariable because it is observed in other pots. He refutes this by pointing out that the cognition of the pot does not occur in dissimilar objects like cloth. Therefore, the pot cognition is variable and limited to specific instances of pots. In contrast, the cognition of existence is invariable because it is universally perceived in all objects without exception. This distinction reinforces the Advaita Vedānta view that only the unchanging existence is real, while the specific forms are unreal due to their variability and impermanence.

---

## **VIII. Next Steps**

### **1. Reflective Practice**

- **Contemplate the Universality of Existence**:

  - Observe how the sense of 'being' or 'existence' is constant across all perceptions.
  - Reflect on the transient nature of specific object cognitions.

- **Meditate on the Invariable Reality**:

  - Engage in meditation focusing on the unchanging awareness of existence.
  - Let go of attachments to specific forms and names.

### **2. Study Further**

- **Explore Subsequent Teachings**:

  - Continue studying Śaṅkara's commentary to deepen your understanding of the nature of reality.
  - Examine how this knowledge assists in overcoming ignorance and attaining liberation.

- **Apply the Insights**

  - Incorporate the principles of discrimination and detachment into daily life.
  - Use this understanding to maintain equanimity amidst changing circumstances.

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with the next segment or if there's any particular aspect you'd like to explore further.
---

## **I. Contextual Introduction**

In this segment, Śaṅkara continues addressing objections related to the variability of the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*) and the cognition of specific objects (*ghaṭa-buddhi*, pot cognition). The previous discussion established that while object-specific cognition is variable and dependent on the presence of the object, the cognition of existence is invariable and constant. An objector now raises a concern that when a specific object like a pot is destroyed, the cognition of existence associated with that pot is also not perceived. Śaṅkara responds by explaining why the cognition of existence remains invariable despite the absence of the specific object.

---

## **II. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**Objection**:

*"If the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*) is also not perceived when the pot is destroyed, then..."*

**Answer**:

*"No; because of the absence of the qualified (*viśeṣya-abhāvāt*). The cognition of existence, being related to the attribute (*viśeṣaṇa-viṣayā satī*), when the qualified is absent, and since an attribute cannot exist without the qualified, what would be its object? However, it is not due to the absence of the object of the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*)."*

---

## **III. Term Analysis**

### **Key Terms from Bhāṣya:**

1. **सद्बुद्धिः (sat-buddhiḥ)**: *Cognition of existence*

   - **Explanation**: The awareness or perception of 'existence' or 'being' that accompanies all objects.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Considered invariable and constant across different objects, forming the basis for discerning reality.

2. **नष्टे घटे (naṣṭe ghaṭe)**: *When the pot is destroyed*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to the cessation or disappearance of the specific object (pot).
   - **Contextual Significance**: Used to question whether the cognition of existence persists when the specific object is absent.

3. **न दृश्यते (na dṛśyate)**: *Is not perceived*

   - **Explanation**: Indicates the absence of perception or cognition.
   - **Contextual Significance**: The objection claims that the cognition of existence is not perceived when the pot is destroyed.

4. **इति चेत् (iti cet)**: *If it is so said*

   - **Explanation**: Introduces an objection or hypothetical statement.

5. **विशेष्याभावात् (viśeṣya-abhāvāt)**: *Because of the absence of the qualified*

   - **Explanation**: The qualified (*viśeṣya*) is the object that possesses attributes.
   - **Contextual Significance**: The absence of the specific object (pot) leads to the absence of its attributes.

6. **विशेषणविषया सती (viśeṣaṇa-viṣayā satī)**: *Being related to the attribute*

   - **Explanation**: The cognition of existence pertains to the attribute that qualifies the object.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Existence is an attribute that qualifies objects.

7. **विशेष्याभावे विशेषणानुपपत्तौ (viśeṣyābhāve viśeṣaṇānupapattau)**: *When the qualified is absent, the attribute is impossible*

   - **Explanation**: Without the qualified object, the attribute cannot manifest.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Attributes depend on the existence of the objects they qualify.

8. **किं विषयास्यात् (kiṁ viṣayā syāt)**: *What would be its object?*

   - **Explanation**: Questions what the cognition of existence would pertain to if the object is absent.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Emphasizes that the absence of the object does not negate the existence of existence itself.

9. **न तु पुनः सद्बुद्धेः विषयाभावात् (na tu punaḥ sadbuddheḥ viṣayābhāvāt)**: *But not due to the absence of the object of the cognition of existence*

   - **Explanation**: Clarifies that the cognition of existence does not cease because existence itself is absent, but because the specific object is absent.
   - **Contextual Significance**: Reinforces that existence remains invariable even when specific objects are destroyed.

---

## **IV. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. The Objection Explained**

- **Objection**:

  - The objector asserts that when a specific object like a pot is destroyed (*naṣṭe ghaṭe*), the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*) associated with that pot is also not perceived (*na dṛśyate*).
  - This suggests that the cognition of existence is variable, as it ceases when the object is absent.
  - Therefore, the claim that the cognition of existence is invariable is challenged.

### **2. Śaṅkara's Response**

- **Refutation**:

  - **Denial of the Objection**:

    - Śaṅkara responds with "No" (*na*), indicating that the objection is not valid.

  - **Reason for Non-Perception**:

    - The cognition of existence does not cease due to the absence of existence itself, but because of the absence of the qualified object (*viśeṣya-abhāvāt*).
    - When the pot is destroyed, the qualified (pot) is absent, and thus the attribute (existence) associated with that pot cannot be perceived in relation to it.

  - **Dependence of Attribute on Qualified**:

    - Attributes (*viśeṣaṇa*) cannot exist independently of the objects they qualify (*viśeṣya*).
    - Without the qualified object, the attribute has no locus or object to pertain to (*kiṁ viṣayā syāt*).

  - **Existence of Existence Remains**:

    - The absence of the specific object does not imply the absence of existence itself.
    - The cognition of existence continues to be perceived in other existing objects.

### **3. Clarifying the Invariability of Sadbuddhi**

- **Existence is Universal**:

  - Existence is an attribute that is universally present in all objects.
  - While the cognition of existence associated with a specific object (like the pot) ceases when that object is destroyed, existence itself does not cease.

- **Absence of the Qualified vs. Absence of Existence**:

  - The non-perception of the cognition of existence in relation to the destroyed pot is due to the absence of the pot, not the absence of existence.
  - Existence remains, and the cognition of existence continues in other objects.

### **4. Implications of the Analysis**

- **Cognition of Existence is Invariable**:

  - The cognition of existence is invariable because existence itself does not cease.
  - It is only the association with a specific object that ceases when that object is destroyed.

- **Specific Object Cognition is Variable**:

  - The cognition of the specific object (pot) is variable and ceases when the object is absent.
  - This reinforces the understanding that objects are transient and unreal (asat).

---

## **V. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Existence as the Unchanging Reality**:

  - Existence (sat) is the fundamental reality that persists regardless of the presence or absence of specific objects.
  - The cognition of existence is invariable because it pertains to the universal attribute of 'being'.

- **Objects as Transient Forms**:

  - Objects (pots, cloths, etc.) are transient manifestations that appear and disappear.
  - Their associated cognitions are variable due to their impermanent nature.

### **2. Dependence of Attributes on Objects**

- **Attribute and Qualified Relationship**:

  - Attributes cannot exist independently; they require a qualified object to reside in.
  - The attribute of existence associated with a specific object ceases to be perceived when the object is absent.

- **Existence Remains Unaffected**:

  - The absence of a specific object does not affect the existence of existence itself.
  - Existence continues to be the underlying reality in all other objects.

### **3. Reaffirming the Invariability of Existence**

- **No Absence of Existence**:

  - Existence is not subject to absence; only the specific manifestations change.
  - The cognition of existence does not cease universally, even if it ceases in relation to a specific destroyed object.

---

## **VI. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Cultivating Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Understanding the Nature of Existence**:

  - Recognize that existence is the constant reality underlying all changing forms.
  - Differentiate between the transient objects and the unchanging existence.

- **Perceiving the Universal Existence**:

  - Focus on perceiving existence in all objects, not just in specific ones.
  - This practice helps in transcending attachment to particular forms.

### **2. Developing Non-Attachment (Vairāgya)**

- **Letting Go of Attachment to Specific Objects**:

  - Accept that specific objects will cease to exist and their associated cognitions will cease.
  - Reduce attachment by understanding that the absence of an object does not imply the absence of reality.

- **Anchoring in the Unchanging Reality**:

  - Anchor your awareness in the unchanging existence that is present in all objects.
  - This leads to inner stability and peace, regardless of external changes.

### **3. Overcoming Fear of Loss**

- **Embracing Impermanence of Forms**:

  - Accept that forms are impermanent and their loss is natural.
  - This acceptance reduces fear and grief associated with loss.

- **Trusting in the Eternal Existence**:

  - Develop trust in the eternal existence that underlies all phenomena.
  - Recognize that existence is ever-present and unchanging.

---

## **VII. Summary**

In this segment, Śaṅkara addresses the objection that the cognition of existence (*sat-buddhi*) is not perceived when a specific object like a pot is destroyed, suggesting that it is variable. He clarifies that the non-perception of the cognition of existence in relation to the destroyed pot is due to the absence of the qualified object (*viśeṣya*), not due to the absence of existence itself. Since attributes cannot exist without their qualified objects, the cognition of existence associated with that object naturally ceases when the object is absent. However, existence itself remains unchanging and continues to be perceived in other objects.

This analysis reinforces the Advaita Vedānta teaching that existence is the unchanging reality, while specific objects and their associated cognitions are transient and variable. By understanding this, one can cultivate discrimination and non-attachment, essential qualities for spiritual growth and liberation.

---

## **VIII. Next Steps**

### **1. Reflective Practice**

- **Contemplate the Nature of Existence**:

  - Reflect on how existence persists despite the absence of specific objects.
  - Meditate on the unchanging reality of existence that underlies all forms.

- **Observe the Dependence of Attributes on Objects**:

  - Notice how attributes like color, shape, and even existence (in relation to a specific object) depend on the presence of the object.

### **2. Apply the Insights in Daily Life**

- **Cultivate Non-Attachment**:

  - Practice letting go of attachment to specific objects, understanding their impermanence.
  - Focus on the underlying reality rather than transient forms.

- **Maintain Equanimity Amidst Change**:

  - Develop resilience by anchoring in the unchanging existence.
  - Respond to loss and change with acceptance and wisdom.

### **3. Study Further Teachings**

- **Deepen Understanding of Advaita Vedānta**:

  - Continue studying Śaṅkara's commentary to explore the nature of reality and the self.
  - Examine how this understanding helps overcome ignorance and attain liberation.

- **Explore Related Concepts**:

  - Investigate the relationship between subject, object, and cognition in Advaita Vedānta.
  - Understand how perception and knowledge function in discerning reality.

## **I. Contextual Introduction**

In this segment, **Śaṅkara** addresses an objection concerning the possibility of having a common substratum (**sāmānādhikaraṇya**) between the cognition of existence (**sat-buddhi**) and the cognition of specific objects (like **ghaṭa-buddhi**, the cognition of a pot) when the qualified object is absent. The objection suggests that in the absence of the qualified object, it is inappropriate to consider the two cognitions as sharing the same substratum. Śaṅkara refutes this by providing the example of a mirage, where even in the absence of one of the elements, the sameness of substratum is observed.

---

## **II. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**Objection**:

*"It is not appropriate to have sameness of substratum (**sāmānādhikaraṇya**) when the qualified object like the pot, etc., is absent."*

**Answer**:

*"No; because in cases like a mirage, even when one of the elements is absent, the sameness of substratum is observed, as in 'this is water' (**idam udakam**)."*

---

## **III. Term Analysis**

### **Key Terms from the Bhāṣya:**

1. **एकाधिकरणत्वम् (eka-adhikaraṇatvam)**: *Sameness of substratum*

   - **Explanation**: The condition where two cognitions share the same locus or refer to the same entity.
   - **Etymology**:
     - **एक (eka)**: One.
     - **अधिकरण (adhikaraṇa)**: Substratum or locus.
     - **त्व (tva)**: Suffix indicating 'ness' or 'state of being'.

2. **घटादि-विशेष्य-अभावे (ghaṭādi-viśeṣya-abhāve)**: *In the absence of the qualified object like the pot, etc.*

   - **Explanation**: When specific objects that are qualified (like pots) are not present.
   - **Etymology**:
     - **घटादि (ghaṭādi)**: Pot and so on.
     - **विशेष्य (viśeṣya)**: The qualified or substantive.
     - **अभाव (abhāva)**: Absence or non-existence.

3. **न युक्तम् (na yuktam)**: *Not appropriate*

   - **Explanation**: The assertion that something is not logically acceptable or fitting.

4. **इति चेत् (iti cet)**: *If it is so said*

   - **Explanation**: A phrase introducing an objection or hypothetical argument.

5. **न (na)**: *No*

   - **Explanation**: Śaṅkara's refutation of the objection.

6. **इदम् उदकम् (idam udakam)**: *This is water*

   - **Explanation**: An expression used when seeing a mirage, where 'this' is perceived as 'water'.

7. **मरीच्यादौ (marīcy-ādau)**: *In mirage and similar cases*

   - **Explanation**: Refers to optical illusions like mirages.

8. **अन्यतर-अभावेऽपि (anyatara-abhāve 'pi)**: *Even in the absence of one of the two*

   - **Explanation**: Indicates that even when one of the components is absent, certain cognitive phenomena occur.

9. **सामानाधिकरण्य-दर्शनात् (sāmānādhikaraṇya-darśanāt)**: *Because of the observation of sameness of substratum*

   - **Explanation**: The observed fact that two concepts share the same substratum in cognition.

---

## **IV. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. The Objection Explained**

- **Objection**:

  - It is argued that when the qualified object (e.g., the pot) is absent, it is illogical to assert that the cognition of existence (**sat-buddhi**) and the object cognition (**ghaṭa-buddhi**) share the same substratum.
  - The absence of the qualified object undermines the possibility of **sāmānādhikaraṇya** between the two cognitions.

### **2. Śaṅkara's Response**

- **Refutation**:

  - Śaṅkara responds with "No" (**na**), indicating that the objection is invalid.
  - He provides the example of a mirage (**marīcy-ādau**), where one perceives 'this is water' (**idam udakam**).

- **Explanation of the Example**:

  - In a mirage, water is perceived where there is none.
  - Even though the qualified object (actual water) is absent, the cognition of 'this is water' occurs.
  - This demonstrates that **sāmānādhikaraṇya** is observed even when one of the elements is absent.

### **3. Implications of the Example**

- **Perception Without the Qualified Object**:

  - The mind can superimpose an attribute (water) onto a substratum ('this') even in the absence of the actual object.
  - This shows that sameness of substratum in cognition does not necessarily require the actual presence of the qualified object.

- **Relevance to the Original Issue**:

  - Similarly, even when the pot is absent, the cognition of existence can still share the same substratum with the cognition of the object.
  - Therefore, the absence of the qualified object does not negate the possibility of **sāmānādhikaraṇya**.

---

## **V. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Illusory Nature of Phenomena**:

  - The example underscores how the mind can perceive attributes that are not actually present.
  - This supports the idea that the world of forms is superimposed upon the underlying reality.

- **Existence as the Unchanging Reality**:

  - Existence (**sat**) is constant and not dependent on specific objects.
  - The cognition of existence remains valid even when particular objects are absent.

### **2. Cognition and Superimposition**

- **Superimposition (Adhyāsa)**:

  - The mind's tendency to superimpose attributes onto a substratum is central to Advaita Vedānta.
  - Recognizing this helps in understanding the nature of perception and the illusory nature of the phenomenal world.

- **Role of Cognition in Perceiving Reality**:

  - Cognition can occur even without the actual presence of the object, indicating the mind's power in shaping experiences.
  - This emphasizes the need to discern the real from the unreal.

---

## **VI. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Cultivating Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Discerning the Real from the Unreal**:

  - Recognize that perceptions may not always reflect reality.
  - Develop the ability to distinguish between the unchanging existence and the transient forms superimposed upon it.

### **2. Overcoming Misconceptions**

- **Understanding Superimposition**:

  - Acknowledge that the mind can project attributes onto reality, leading to misconceptions.
  - By understanding this process, one can avoid being misled by appearances.

### **3. Focusing on the Unchanging Self**

- **Anchoring in Existence**:

  - Direct attention to the constant presence of existence that underlies all experiences.
  - This focus helps in transcending the illusions created by the mind.

---

## **VII. Summary**

In this passage, Śaṅkara refutes the objection that sameness of substratum (**sāmānādhikaraṇya**) cannot exist when the qualified object is absent. He uses the example of a mirage, where one perceives 'this is water' despite the absence of actual water, to demonstrate that the mind can perceive a common substratum even without the qualified object. This reinforces the Advaita Vedānta teaching that existence is the unchanging reality, and that the cognition of existence remains valid regardless of the presence or absence of specific objects. Understanding this helps practitioners develop discrimination between the real and the unreal and focus on the unchanging Self.

---

## **VIII. Next Steps**

### **1. Reflective Practice**

- **Meditate on the Nature of Perception**:

  - Contemplate how the mind perceives and superimposes attributes onto reality.
  - Reflect on experiences where perceptions did not match reality, such as illusions or dreams.

### **2. Deepen Understanding**

- **Study the Concept of Adhyāsa (Superimposition)**:

  - Explore how superimposition contributes to ignorance and how its removal leads to liberation.
  - Examine other examples from scriptures that illustrate this concept.

### **3. Apply the Insights**

- **Practice Mindfulness**:

  - Be attentive to how the mind constructs experiences.
  - Cultivate awareness of the underlying existence in all situations.

This understanding is crucial for spiritual seekers to overcome grief and delusion by focusing on the eternal nature of the Self.

---

## **II. Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**"Therefore, of the body and so on, and of the dualities, which are effects with causes and are unreal (*asat*), there is no being (*bhāva*), as stated. Likewise, of the real (*sat*), which is the Self, there is no non-being (*abhāva*), non-existence does not exist, because it is invariable everywhere, as we have said."**

    - **Explanation**: Indicates that this conclusion has been previously established.
    - **Contextual Significance**: Reinforces the consistency of the teaching.

---

## **IV. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Conclusion on the Unreal (Asat)**

- **No True Existence of the Unreal**:

  - **Body and Dualities as Unreal**: The body (*deha*) and sensory experiences (*dvandva*) are transient and arise from causes (*sākāraṇa*).
  - **Lack of True Being**: These unreal entities do not possess true existence (*na vidyate bhāvaḥ*).
  - **Reasoning**: As effects dependent on causes, they are impermanent and subject to change.

  - **Integration of Concepts**: This conclusion ties together the earlier discussions on the nature of reality and unreality.

---

## **V. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Non-Dual Reality**:

  - **The Self as the Only Reality**: In Advaita Vedānta, the Self (Brahman) is the sole reality.
  - **Illusory Nature of the World**: The phenomenal world, including the body and sensory experiences, is considered an illusion (māyā) and unreal.

- **Unchanging Nature of the Self**:

  - **Eternal and Immutable**: The Self is eternal, without beginning or end, and not subject to change.
  - **Beyond Causality**: The Self is not an effect of any cause; it is self-existent.

### **2. Understanding Existence and Non-Existence**

- **Existence of the Unreal**:

  - **Apparent Existence**: The unreal appears to exist due to ignorance but lacks true being.
  - **Transient Phenomena**: All that is subject to change and dependent on causes is unreal.

- **Non-Existence of the Real**:

  - **Impossible**: The real, being the Self, cannot not exist; its non-existence is impossible.
  - **Foundation of All**: The Self is the substratum upon which all apparent phenomena appear.

---

## **VI. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Cultivating Discrimination (Viveka)**

- **Distinguishing Real from Unreal**:

  - **Discernment**: Develop the ability to distinguish between the eternal Self and the transient body and experiences.
  - **Self-Inquiry**: Engage in practices that lead to the direct realization of the Self.

---

## **VII. Summary**

In this concluding commentary on Bhagavad Gītā 2.16, Śaṅkara emphasizes that transient entities like the body and sensory experiences, which arise from causes and are therefore unreal (*asat*), do not possess true existence (*bhāva*). Conversely, the Self, being real (*sat*), never ceases to exist and is unchanging across all times and situations. This understanding is essential for spiritual aspirants to cultivate discrimination between the real and the unreal, develop detachment from impermanent phenomena, and focus on realizing the eternal Self. By internalizing these teachings, one can overcome grief, delusion, and ultimately attain liberation.

---

## **VIII. Next Steps**

### **1. Reflect on the Teachings**

---

## **II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya Analysis**

### **Translation of the Bhāṣya Segment**

**"Thus, the conclusion (*antaḥ*) regarding both—the Self and the non-Self, the real and the unreal—has been seen (*dṛṣṭaḥ*) and understood (*upalabdhaḥ*): the real is indeed real, and the unreal is indeed unreal, by the seers of the truth (*tattva-darśibhiḥ*), as stated. 'Tat' is a pronoun; and 'Tat' is the name of Brahman, which is all. The nature of 'Tat' is 'Tattva' (truth), the true essence of Brahman. Those whose nature is to see that ('Tat') are the seers of the truth; by those seers of the truth. You too, adopting the vision of the seers of truth, abandoning grief and delusion, enduring the dualities like heat and cold, which are of definite and indefinite forms, and thinking in your mind 'this modification, being unreal like water in a mirage, appears falsely,' should forbear—that is the meaning."**

## **II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya Analysis**

### **Contextual Introduction**

After explaining the distinction between the real (*sat*) and the unreal (*asat*), Śaṅkara anticipates a question: **"What, then, is that which is always real?"** To answer this, he presents verse 2.17, which elaborates on the nature of the indestructible reality—the Self or Brahman.

### **Translation of the Bhāṣya**

1. **अविनाशि न विनष्टुं शीलं यस्य इति ।**

   "अविनाशि (avināśi): that whose nature is not to be destroyed."

2. **तुशब्दः असतो विशेषणार्थः ।**

   "The particle 'tu' (but) is used to distinguish it from the unreal."

3. **तत् विद्धि विजानीहि ।**

   "Know that."

4. **किम्? येन सर्वम् इदं जगत् ततं व्याप्तं सदाख्येन ब्रह्मणा साकाशम्, आकाशेनेव घटादयः ।**

   "What is that? By which all this world is pervaded—the Brahman called 'Sat' (Being), along with space, just as pots and the like are pervaded by space."

5. **विनाशम् अदर्शनम् अभावम् ।**

   "Destruction (*vināśa*) means disappearance or non-existence."

6. **अव्ययस्य न व्येति उपचय-अपचयौ न याति इति अव्ययम् तस्य अव्ययस्य ।**

   "Of the immutable (*avyaya*), that which does not decay—does not undergo increase or decrease—is called 'immutable'; of that immutable."

7. **नैतत् सदाख्यं ब्रह्म स्वेन रूपेण व्येति व्यभिचरति, निरवयवत्वात्, देहादिवत् ।**

   "This Brahman, called 'Sat', does not decay or change in its own nature because it is without parts, unlike the body and so on."

8. **न अपि आत्मीयेन, आत्मीय-अभावात् ।**

   "Nor does it decay through its possessions, because it has no possessions."

9. **यथा देवदत्तो धनहान्या व्येति, न तु एवं ब्रह्म व्येति ।**

   "Just as Devadatta decays through loss of wealth, but Brahman does not decay in this way."

10. **अतः अव्ययस्य अस्य ब्रह्मणः विनाशं न कश्चित् कर्तुम् अर्हति, न कश्चित् आत्मानं विनाशयितुं शक्नोति ईश्वरः अपि ।**

    "Therefore, no one can bring about the destruction of this immutable Brahman; no one, not even God (Īśvara), can destroy the Self."

11. **आत्मा हि ब्रह्म, स्वात्मनि च क्रिया-विरोधात् ।**

    "For the Self is indeed Brahman, and action upon one's own Self is a contradiction."

### **Dialectical Analysis**

#### **1. Nature of the Indestructible**

- **Emphasis on 'Tu'**: The particle 'but' distinguishes the indestructible reality from the destructible unreal entities discussed earlier.

#### **2. Brahman as All-Pervading**

### **2. Nature of Brahman**

- **All-Pervading**: Brahman pervades everything in existence, including space and all objects within it.
- **Partless and Formless**: Brahman is without parts (niravayava) and therefore cannot undergo decay or destruction.
- **Actionless**: Brahman does not engage in actions and cannot be the object of action.

### **3. Indestructibility of the Self**

- **Self as Eternal**: The Self cannot be destroyed because it is identical with Brahman.
- **Logical Impossibility of Self-Destruction**: Since the Self is the essence of existence, it cannot act upon itself to cause its own non-existence.

## **V. Summary**

In verse 2.17, Lord Krishna explains the nature of the indestructible reality—Brahman or the Self—which pervades the entire universe. Śaṅkara's commentary elucidates that this Self is immutable, partless, and devoid of possessions, making it incapable of undergoing destruction or change. Since Brahman is the very essence of existence and identical with the Self, it cannot be destroyed by anyone, not even by Īśvara (God). The logical impossibility of self-destruction reinforces the eternal and unchanging nature of the Self.

Understanding this truth empowers spiritual seekers to transcend fear, grief, and delusion by realizing their true nature as the immortal Self. It encourages the cultivation of equanimity, detachment from the transient, and a deep sense of unity with all existence.
