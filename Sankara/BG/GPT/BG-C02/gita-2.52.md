Tadā gantāsi nirvedaṁ śrotavyasya śrutasya ca || 2.52 ||**

### **Translation**

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this verse, **Lord Krishna** continues his instruction to **Arjuna** on the nature of wisdom and the journey towards Self-realization. Following the discussion on the importance of performing actions with equanimity and the skillfulness in action (Yoga), Krishna now speaks about the purification of the intellect and the transcendence of delusion. He points out that once the intellect overcomes the confusion caused by ignorance (*moha*), one attains dispassion towards the ritualistic portions of the Vedas—what has been heard and what is yet to be heard—implying a shift from external rituals to internal realization.

**Śaṅkarācārya's commentary** elaborates on this process, explaining how the intellect becomes purified through the practice of Yoga and how this leads to dispassion towards the Vedic injunctions that are not directly related to Self-knowledge.

### **3. Detailed Commentary**

#### **a. Crossing Beyond the Delusion**

**यदा यस्मिन्काले ते तव मोहकलिलं मोहात्मकम् अविवेकरूपं कालुष्यं येन आत्मानात्मविवेकबोधं कलुषीकृत्य विषयं प्रत्यन्तःकरणं प्रवर्तते, तत् तव बुद्धिः व्यतितरिष्यति व्यतिक्रमिष्यति, अतिशुद्धभावम् आपत्स्यते इत्यर्थः।**

*"When, at that time, your intellect (*buddhi*), which has been polluted by the dense impurity (*kalilam*) of delusion (*moha*)—which is of the nature of non-discrimination (*aviveka*), and by which the inner instrument (*antaḥkaraṇa*) gets involved with objects by obscuring the knowledge of the discrimination between the Self and the not-Self—when that intellect crosses beyond (*vyatitariṣyati*), meaning it will attain the state of supreme purity."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **मोहकलिलम् (moha-kalilam)**: The dense impurity of delusion.
  - **अविवेकरूपम् (aviveka-rūpam)**: Of the nature of non-discrimination.
  - **कालुष्यं (kāluṣyam)**: Impurity or defilement.
  - **आत्मानात्मविवेकबोधम् (ātma-anātma-viveka-bodham)**: Knowledge of the discrimination between the Self and the not-Self.
  - **व्यतितरिष्यति (vyatitariṣyati)**: Will cross beyond.

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara explains that delusion, rooted in ignorance and lack of discrimination, pollutes the intellect, causing it to engage with sense objects and obscuring the true knowledge of the Self. When the intellect transcends this delusion, it becomes supremely pure.

#### **b. Attaining Dispassion**

**तदा तस्मिन् काले गन्तासि प्राप्स्यसि निर्वेदं वैराग्यं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च।**

*"Then, at that time, you will attain dispassion (*nirveda*), detachment, towards what is to be heard (*śrotavya*) and what has been heard (*śruta*)."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **गन्तासि (gantāsi)**: You will attain.
  - **निर्वेदम् (nirvedam)**: Dispassion or detachment.
  - **श्रोतव्यस्य (śrotavyasya)**: Of what is to be heard.
  - **श्रुतस्य (śrutasya)**: Of what has been heard.

- **Explanation**: Upon purification of the intellect, one develops dispassion towards the ritualistic and injunctive portions of the scriptures—both those already studied and those yet to be studied—realizing that they are not the ultimate means to liberation.

#### **c. Implication of Dispassion**

**तदा श्रोतव्यं श्रुतं च ते निष्फलं प्रतिभाति इति अभिप्रायः।**

*"Then, what is to be heard and what has been heard will appear to you as fruitless; this is the purport."*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara concludes that when one attains this state of purified intellect, the ritualistic practices and scriptural injunctions lose their appeal, as one recognizes their limitations in leading to ultimate liberation.
