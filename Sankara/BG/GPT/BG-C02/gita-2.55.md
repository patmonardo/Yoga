## **I. Mūla Verse**

### **Sanskrit**

**श्रीभगवानुवाच —
प्रजहाति यदा कामान् सर्वान् पार्थ मनोगतान् ।
आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ॥ २.५५ ॥**

### **Transliteration**

**śrī-bhagavān uvāca —
prajahāti yadā kāmān sarvān pārtha mano-gatān |
ātmani eva ātmanā tuṣṭaḥ sthita-prajñaḥ tadā ucyate || 2.55 ||**

### **Translation**

**The Blessed Lord said:
"When a person completely casts off all desires of the mind, O Pārtha (Arjuna), and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then he is said to be one of steady wisdom."**

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** introduces the characteristics of a **sthita-prajña**—a person of steady wisdom—as described by **Lord Krishna** in the **Bhagavad Gītā** (2.55). Śaṅkara explains that whether one has renounced actions from the very beginning to pursue the path of knowledge or has progressed through Karma Yoga (the Yoga of action), the signs and practices leading to the state of steady wisdom are the same.

He emphasizes that in spiritual teachings, the characteristics of one who has achieved the goal (*kṛtārtha-lakṣaṇāni*) are presented as the means (*sādhanāni*) for others, because they are attainable through effort (*yatna-sādhyatvāt*). Thus, the Lord describes both the characteristics and the means to attain the state of steady wisdom in the verses beginning with "prajahāti" up to the end of the chapter.

**Translation:**

"Whether one has renounced actions from the very beginning and engaged in steadfastness in the Yoga of knowledge, or one who has progressed through Karma Yoga—starting from 'prajahāti' (2.55) up to the end of the chapter, the characteristics (*lakṣaṇa*) of the person of steady wisdom (*sthita-prajña*) and the means (*sādhana*) are taught for both. Indeed, in all spiritual scriptures, the characteristics of one who has achieved the goal are presented as the means, because they are attainable through effort. Those characteristics which are attainable through effort become the means. The Blessed Lord said:"
