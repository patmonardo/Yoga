Below is the analysis of **Bhagavad Gītā 2.55**, continuing our integrative approach. This verse introduces the concept of “situated wisdom” (sthita-prajñā) and describes the internal state of one who is no longer driven by desires. Although it does not explicitly mention terms like āsana or prāṇāyāma, we will look carefully for words and concepts that can analogously point toward the internal disciplines of Yoga. As per the hint, even though pratyāhāra itself is not named, words like “samharate” (to withdraw) appear in related contexts (later verses) and can serve as conceptual bridges, showing how the Gītā’s psychological transformations mirror the progressive stages of Yoga practice.

**Transliteration** (Key Excerpts)
```markdown
prajahāti prakṛṣeṇa jahāti parityajati yadā yasmin kāle sarvān kāmān mano-gatān…
ātmany eva pratyag-ātma-svarūpe eva ātmanā svenaiva bāhya-lābha-nirapekṣaḥ tuṣṭaḥ…
sthita-prajñaḥ… tyakta-putra-vitta-lokaaiṣaṇaḥ saṃnyāsī ātmārāma ātmakrīḍaḥ…
```

**Translation (Provisional)**
"From the beginning, whether one has renounced actions to be established in the yoga of knowledge or reached this point through Karma Yoga, the defining characteristics and methods of one who is of steady wisdom are taught from ‘prajahāti’ (2.55) up to the end of this chapter. In spiritual scriptures, the marks of one who has achieved the goal are also taught as the means, since they can be pursued through effort.

‘Prajahāti’ means thoroughly abandoning all desires. When one abandons all desires arising in the mind, O Pārtha, one who is satisfied in the very Self by oneself, independent of external gains, having realized the nectar of the highest truth, and feeling that nothing else is needed — that one is called ‘sthita-prajña,’ established in the wisdom born of discriminating the Self from the non-Self. This wise one, having renounced worldly longings such as for progeny, wealth, and fame, is a true renunciate, delighting in the Self alone."

### III. Term Analysis

**Key Terms from Mūla Verse**:

- **प्रजहाति (prajahāti)**: To completely abandon or discard
  *Contextual Significance*: This act of abandoning desires parallels the inner process of sensory withdrawal. While pratyāhāra involves withdrawing the senses from external objects, prajahāti indicates a mental withdrawal from internal desires. It’s a psychological “letting go” that sets the stage for deeper inward practices like prāṇāyāma (to calm the mind-body system) and eventually pratyāhāra (to turn senses inward).

- **आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः (ātmany evātmana tuṣṭaḥ)**: Content in the Self alone, by the Self
  *Contextual Significance*: Indicates an inward turning, an internal stabilization that resonates with the qualities needed for advanced Yoga. Just as a stable āsana is being comfortable and steady in one’s own posture, being satisfied in the Self is a mental “posture” of stability.

- **स्थितप्रज्ञ (sthita-prajña)**: One of steady wisdom
  *Contextual Significance*: Sthita-prajña is akin to a stable platform of the mind. This mental stability parallels the physical stability of āsana and the rhythmic steadiness of prāṇāyāma. Only when the mind is stable can it undertake subtle processes like “samharate” (withdraw) in the coming verses.

**Key Concepts from Bhāṣya**:

- **त्यक्त… ऐषणः (tyakta… aiṣaṇaḥ)**: Renouncing all forms of worldly longing
  *Contextual Significance*: Similar to pratyāhāra’s withdrawing senses from their objects, here the practitioner withdraws from the psychological drives and cravings. This mental renunciation sets the inner space clear for subtle breath control and eventually sense-withdrawal.

- **आत्माराम आत्मक्रीड (ātmārāma ātmakrīḍa)**: Rejoicing and playing in the Self
  *Contextual Significance*: Suggests an inward enjoyment free of external stimuli. In the progressive path, after achieving external stability (āsana) and internal rhythmic harmony (prāṇāyāma), the mind can “rest” inwardly, preparing for the deeper inward turn (pratyāhāra).

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: Initially, the practitioner is entangled with various desires, analogous to a body unsettled (no stable āsana) and breath uncontrolled (no prāṇāyāma). The mind is outward-directed, fixated on external gains.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: Through understanding and gradual practice, the seeker abandons all mental desires (prajahāti). This mirrors the psychological readiness for internal disciplines: the mind becomes stable, content in itself. This internal stabilization is a conceptual stepping stone toward controlling the subtle aspects of the bodily-mind system, akin to how mastery of āsana precedes prāṇāyāma.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: Once desires are renounced, the practitioner attains a stable mental posture (sthita-prajñā). This stable wisdom is a mental environment where prāṇāyāma (control of breath) can be effectively introduced to refine internal energies, and eventually, the senses can be withdrawn (pratyāhāra) without distraction. Although “samharate” (to withdraw) will appear explicitly in a later verse (2.58) to describe sense-withdrawal akin to pratyāhāra, the current verse lays the mental groundwork: without the storm of desires, sense-withdrawal becomes possible.

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Systematic Refinement**: The text transitions from intellectual steadiness to emotional and sensory equanimity. This systematic refinement aligns with rational and experiential unfolding, characteristic of the 1804 Science of Knowing: from external entanglements to internal clarity.

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: Abandoning desires dissolves the subject-object tension that drives the mind outward. Non-dual insight arises naturally when the mind no longer seeks external fulfillment. This non-dual state supports subtle Yogic interventions like prāṇāyāma and eventual sense-withdrawal (pratyāhāra).

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: Similar to Buddhism’s ideal of nirodha (cessation), the Gītā’s abandoning of desires reduces mental proliferations. Yoga’s pratyāhāra involves turning senses inward, and this verse shows the mental equivalent: turning desire inward until it ceases. Stable wisdom prepares for prāṇāyāma by reducing inner turbulence, making sense-withdrawal (samharate) straightforward later.

- **From Ethical to Internal Yoga**: Just as external moral restraint (yama, niyama) and physical stability (āsana) set the stage for controlling the breath (prāṇāyāma), here mental stability and desirelessness set the stage for sense-withdrawal (pratyāhāra). Although not stated as “āsana” or “prāṇāyāma,” the underlying structure mirrors these steps.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: Being content in the Self eliminates the need for external objects, revealing the Self’s non-dual nature. Once the non-dual ground is realized, controlling subtle aspects of being (like breath and senses) is a matter of deepening into what already is, rather than striving for what is not.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: Abhidharma stresses uprooting underlying tendencies (āsava). Abandoning all desires parallels uprooting these tendencies, paving the way for tranquil concentration and insight. Similarly, in Yoga, with mental agitation pacified, controlling the subtle energies (prāṇāyāma) and withdrawing senses (pratyāhāra) becomes more natural.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.55 establishes that renouncing desires yields a stable, inwardly content mind. This mental posture is to the inner world what āsana is to the body and prāṇāyāma is to the breath. It’s a psychic alignment enabling the subtle work of sense-withdrawal.

- **Foundation for Samharate (Pratyāhāra)**: Although we have not yet seen “samharate” in this verse, its conceptual prerequisites are here. By achieving sthita-prajñā, the practitioner lays the foundation so that when the instruction to withdraw senses appears (verse 2.58: “yadā saṁharate cāyaṁ…”), the mind is ready to follow it effortlessly.

# Next Steps

- **Looking Ahead**: As we continue forward, we will watch for terms like “samharate” (2.58) that echo pratyāhāra and consider how the mental stability achieved here enables that subtle inward turn.
- **Refining the Trajectory**: We have established a pattern: mental purification and stability first, followed by subtle internal disciplines. The journey sets the stage for understanding how the Gītā’s teachings align with the yoga limbs without explicitly naming them.

---

By analyzing Verse 2.55, we see how mental equanimity and self-sufficiency resemble the stable foundation needed for advanced Yogic techniques. Just as prāṇāyāma refines internal energies after achieving a stable āsana, the mental stillness and desirelessness described here prepare the practitioner for the internal sense-withdrawal hinted at by terms like “samharate.”
