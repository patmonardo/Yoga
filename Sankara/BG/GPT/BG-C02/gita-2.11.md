**Explanation of the Passage:**

This is the **11th verse** from the **Bhagavad Gita**, in which **Lord Krishna** addresses **Arjuna**, who is in a state of confusion and sorrow, having fallen into the **ocean of grief** due to the impending war and the loss of his loved ones. Krishna, in his role as a spiritual guide, seeks to lift **Arjuna** from his delusion and sorrow by teaching him about the nature of life, death, and the true wisdom of the **self** (Atman).

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Arjuna’s Sorrow (Shoka):**
   The verse opens with an acknowledgment of **Arjuna's grief**. He is deeply immersed in sorrow due to the death of **loved ones** and the potential loss in the battle. However, Krishna points out that Arjuna's grief is based on **misunderstanding** (mithyājñāna) about the nature of life and death. **Arjuna's attachment** to his loved ones and the **empirical reality of life and death** is preventing him from seeing the eternal truth (the **Self**).

2. **The Pandit’s Perspective:**
   Krishna then contrasts **Arjuna’s grief** with the **wisdom of the learned (Pandit)**. He says that **true sages** (Panditas) do not grieve for the **dead** (those who have passed away) or the **living** (those who remain alive). **Pandits**, who possess **self-knowledge**, understand that the **Atman (Self)** is eternal and indestructible, while the physical body is transient. Hence, they do not mourn over those who are **dead** or those who are **alive**, because they see beyond the physical realm.

3. **The Nature of the Self (Atman):**
   Krishna points out that the **wise (Panditas)** do not mourn because they recognize the **eternal nature of the soul**. The **Atman** is never born and never dies, and it transcends the temporary states of **life and death**. This teaching counters the **illusion (Maya)** of identifying the self with the transient body and mind. The true **Pandita** perceives the **Self** as eternal, unaffected by the birth and death of the body.

4. **Addressing Arjuna’s Confusion:**
   Krishna further criticizes **Arjuna's sorrow** by stating that he is grieving over something that is **not worth grieving for**. He uses the phrase **"aśocyān anvashochaḥ"** (you are grieving over the unworthy). The **Panditas** understand that those who have died are **immortal in essence**, and there is no need to mourn for them. This is a key principle in the **Vedantic** philosophy: the **impermanence of the physical body** and the **eternity of the soul**.

5. **Criticism of Arjuna’s Intellectual Confusion:**
   Krishna then emphasizes that **Arjuna**, though a **warrior**, is **acting like a fool** (Mūḍha). Arjuna has been speaking words of wisdom (prājñavādāns), but his actions and emotional state show that he is not truly aligned with this wisdom. Krishna points out the **contradiction** in Arjuna’s behavior—though he speaks of knowledge, his attachment to the **temporary world** and its fleeting concerns demonstrate that he has not yet realized the higher truth.

6. **The Eternal Nature of the Soul:**
   Krishna affirms that **true knowledge** is the realization that **the Self** (Atman) is beyond **death** and **birth**, and therefore those who are **dead** (like Bhishma and Drona) are not to be grieved over. The **body** is subject to decay, but the **soul** is eternal. Therefore, the wise **Pandit** does not mourn over death, because they understand that the **soul** continues its journey.

### **Summary of Krishna’s Teaching:**

- **Grief** arises from a **lack of self-knowledge** and a **misunderstanding** of the **nature of life** and **death**.
- **Pandits** do not mourn for the **dead** or the **living** because they recognize the **eternal nature** of the **Self (Atman)**.
- **Arjuna**'s grief is rooted in his identification with the **temporary body** and **worldly attachments**, which prevent him from understanding the **eternal truth** of the **Self**.
- Krishna admonishes Arjuna for being **deluded** and **acting contrary to wisdom** by grieving over what is ultimately impermanent.

### **Conclusion:**
In this verse, **Lord Krishna** begins to instruct **Arjuna** on the nature of **self-realization** (Atman), where the **wise** understand that **death** is merely the **departure of the soul** from the body and not the end of existence. As Arjuna is still caught up in **emotional attachment**, Krishna gently nudges him to look beyond the material world and recognize his true nature as the **immortal Self**.
