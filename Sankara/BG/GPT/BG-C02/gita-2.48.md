### **Translation**

**"Established in Yoga, O Dhanañjaya (Arjuna), perform actions, abandoning attachment; being the same in success and failure—such evenness of mind is called Yoga."**

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this verse, **Lord Krishna** introduces the concept of **Karma Yoga**—the path of selfless action performed with equanimity. After explaining the importance of acting without attachment to the fruits of actions in previous verses, Krishna now instructs Arjuna on how to perform his duties while remaining rooted in Yoga.

This marks a transition from the theoretical understanding of the Self (*Sāṅkhya*) to the practical application of that knowledge through disciplined action (*Yoga*). The emphasis is on maintaining mental evenness amidst the dualities of success and failure, which is considered the essence of Yoga.

**योगस्थः सन् कुरु कर्माणि केवलम् ईश्वरार्थम्; तत्र अपि 'ईश्वरो मे तुष्यतु' इति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय।**

*"Being established in Yoga, perform actions solely for the sake of the Lord (Īśvara); even in that, abandoning attachment such as 'May the Lord be pleased with me,' O Dhanañjaya."*

- **Key Terms**:

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara emphasizes that one should perform actions while firmly rooted in Yoga—acting without selfish motives, dedicating actions to God. Even the subtle attachment to the idea of pleasing God should be relinquished.

#### **b. Equanimity in Success and Failure**

**फलतृष्णाशून्येन क्रियमाणे कर्मणि सत्त्वशुद्धिजा ज्ञानप्राप्तिलक्षणा सिद्धिः, तद्विपर्ययजा असिद्धिः; तयोः सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः अपि समः तुल्यः भूत्वा कुरु कर्माणि।**

*"In actions performed by one devoid of craving for results (phala-tṛṣṇā-śūnya), success is characterized by the attainment of knowledge born of purity of mind (sattva-śuddhi), and failure is born of its opposite; towards both success and failure, being the same, equal, perform actions."*

**कोऽसौ योगः यत्रस्थः कुरु इति उक्तम्? इदमेव तत् — सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समत्वं योगः उच्यते।**

*"What is that Yoga, being established in which you are told to act? This itself is that—equanimity in success and failure is called Yoga."*
