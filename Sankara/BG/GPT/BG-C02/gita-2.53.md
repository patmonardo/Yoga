**Translation:**

*"Your intellect (buddhi), which has been perplexed and scattered by hearing various scriptural teachings (śrutis) that reveal multiple relationships between ends and means, characterized by injunctions and prohibitions, and thus, being confused (vipratipannā), when at that time it will stand firm (sthāsyati), becoming steady (sthirībhūtā), free from disturbances and movements (vikṣepa-calana-varjitā), and established in deep meditation (samādhi)..."*
