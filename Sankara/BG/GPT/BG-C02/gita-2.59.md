Below is the analysis of **Bhagavad Gītā 2.59**, continuing our integrative methodology. Here, Śaṅkara’s commentary clarifies that merely withholding external sense engagement does not uproot the subtle “taste” (rasa) or inner longing for objects. This verse refines our understanding of pratyāhāra (sense withdrawal) by highlighting that it must be reinforced by deep insight (prajñā) to be effective. The conversation about dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and samādhi—collectively known as samyama—revolves around stabilizing prajñā so that not just the gross sense-activities but also the subtle inclinations (rasa) toward them are transcended.

# Technical Analysis Artifact: Bhagavad Gītā 2.59

### I. Mūla Verse

**Sanskrit**
```markdown
विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।
रसवर्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥ ५९ ॥
```

**Transliteration**
```markdown
viṣayā vinivartante nirāhārasya dehinaḥ |
rasa-varjaṃ raso ’py asya paraṃ dṛṣṭvā nivartate || 59 ||
```

**Translation**
"For one who abstains from sense objects, the objects indeed fall away. Yet, leaving only the subtle taste (rasa) behind, even that taste ceases once the Highest (Truth) is seen."

### II. Śaṅkara Bhāṣya

**Sanskrit Original (Provided Text)**
```markdown
यद्यपि विषयाः ... निराहारस्य ... मूर्खस्यापि विनिवर्तन्ते ...
रसवर्जं रसो रागो विषयेषु ... सोऽपि रसो ... परं दृष्ट्वा ... निवर्तते ...
न असति सम्यग्दर्शने रसस्य उच्छेदः ।
तस्मात् सम्यग्दर्शनात्मिकायाः प्रज्ञायाः स्थैर्यं कर्तव्यमित्यभिप्रायः ॥ ५९ ॥
```

**Key Bhāṣya Points**:
- Even a fool, if forcibly refraining from sense enjoyment (like rigorous austerity), finds that gross engagement with objects stops.
- Yet, the subtle longing (rasa, akin to a residual impression or attachment) persists.
- “Rasa” here is understood as subtle attachment or “coloration” (rañjanā-rūpa), a deep-seated inclination.
- This subtle inclination only disappears upon “seeing the Supreme” (paraṃ dṛṣṭvā), i.e., having direct realization of Brahman/ultimate truth.
- Without true insight (samyak-darśana), the subtle craving remains. Therefore, stable, insight-driven prajñā is essential.

This commentary underscores that controlling the senses externally is insufficient; the inner seed of attachment must be eradicated through clear, stable knowledge (prajñā).

### III. Term Analysis

**Key Terms from Mūla Verse**:

- **विषया विनिवर्तन्ते (viṣayā vinivartante)**: Sense-objects fall away
  *Contextual Significance*: Merely stopping external indulgence may remove the objects from your immediate experience, much like pratyāhāra withdraws senses. However, this alone does not guarantee the removal of internal cravings.

- **रस (rasa)**: The subtle taste or attachment
  *Contextual Significance*: Even after pratyāhāra (withdrawal), a latent longing can remain. This subtle craving corresponds to the internal seeds of vāsanās (impressions) that must be tackled at a deeper level of meditative insight.

- **परं दृष्ट्वा (paraṃ dṛṣṭvā)**: Seeing the Supreme (Truth)
  *Contextual Significance*: Direct realization of Brahman, akin to the deeper absorption states in Yoga (dhyāna/samādhi), removes even the subtle taste. This resonates with Yogic progress from dhāraṇā (focus) to dhyāna (continuous flow of attention) and eventually to samādhi (where subject-object duality dissolves).

**From the Bhāṣya**:

- **सम्यग्दर्शन (samyag-darśana)**: Perfect vision or complete insight
  *Contextual Significance*: Without right knowledge, subtle attachments cannot be uprooted. This stable wisdom is what Śaṅkara points to as essential for the full transformation from merely restraining senses to true freedom. It ties in with the practice of dhāraṇā-dhyāna-samādhi (samyama), as stable insight (prajñā) emerges from these sustained meditative states.

### IV. Dialectical Structure (Being / Essence / Concept)

1. **Being (Initial Moment)**: The practitioner may externally refrain from sense contact (like fasting or avoiding luxuries), achieving a rudimentary form of pratyāhāra. Senses are curbed, but the mind still harbors desires.

2. **Essence (Deeper Insight)**: Recognizing that subtle longing (rasa) persists even when gross engagement is stopped. The practitioner sees that deeper cognitive transformation is required—just as dhāraṇā steadies the mind, dhyāna refines and deepens this steadiness, and samādhi reveals the ultimate truth. Without insight, the subtle “taste” remains.

3. **Concept (Culminating Synthesis)**: Attaining paraṃ dṛṣṭvā — direct vision of the Supreme — annihilates subtle cravings. This corresponds to deep meditative absorption where dhāraṇā (concentration) matures into dhyāna (effortless meditation), and dhyāna matures into samādhi (complete absorption). Together, these three stages form samyama, yielding stable insight (prajñā). With such prajñā, the internal seeds of attachment (rasa) dissolve. Thus, the verse teaches that beyond pratyāhāra, one must cultivate true insight through deeper meditative refinement (dharana/dhyana/samadhi).

# Trans-Idealist Analysis Artifact: Krishna-Sankara-Abhidharma Integration

### I. 1804 Framework Application

- **Systematic Development**: The text evolves logically from mere external restraint to the necessity of true understanding. Just as Kantian/Idealist frameworks move from sensory impressions to rational insight, here we move from external control to inner knowledge. Perfect insight transcends the phenomenal level (external sense objects) into the noumenal (Brahman).

- **Non-Dual Conditioning**: Non-duality implies that external abstinence is incomplete without realization that all is Brahman. When the practitioner “sees” this ultimate truth, no separate desirous subject or desired object remains, dissolving residual longing.

### II. Buddhist-Yogic Integration

- **Comparative Analysis**: In Buddhism, superficial renunciation doesn’t remove latent tendencies (anuśaya). Direct insight (vipassanā) eradicates the root. Similarly, in Yoga, after achieving pratyāhāra, one must move into dhāraṇā and dhyāna to refine mental patterns. Finally, samādhi and the resulting prajñā uproot the deepest attachments.

- **Path to Dharana and Beyond**: Pratyāhāra sets the stage by withdrawing from external objects. Dharana focuses the mind inward. Without stable dharana leading to dhyāna and samādhi, subtle attachments remain. This verse suggests that samyama (dharana-dhyana-samadhi) is required to achieve the highest insight that liberates from all subtle cravings.

### III. Non-Dual Analysis

- **Advaita Vedānta Perspective**: The subtle attachment is due to ignorance of one’s true nature. Upon direct realization of Brahman (paraṃ dṛṣṭvā), the individuality that craves disappears. Samyama’s role is to still the mind so thoroughly that the non-dual truth shines forth, removing even the subtlest desires.

- **Abhidharma Parallels**: Abhidharma theory indicates that the final release from craving (taṇhā) and subtle tendencies (vāsanā) occurs upon direct insight into the true nature of phenomena (yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana). Similarly, the Gītā points to Brahmavidyā as the ultimate remover of residual attachment.

### IV. Philosophical Synthesis

- **Unified Understanding**: Verse 2.59 shows that external discipline (pratyāhāra) isn’t the end. True freedom comes from deep inner transformation via insight. Stabilizing prajñā—achieved through progressive states of dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and samādhi—removes the subtle longing, aligning perfectly with Śaṅkara’s Jñāna Mārga.

- **Technical Roadmap to Samyama**: The verse supports the idea that controlling the senses (like pratyāhāra) is a preliminary stage. Beyond that lies dhāraṇā (one-pointed focus), dhyāna (continuous flow of that focus), and samādhi (complete absorption), collectively known as samyama. Samyama is what allows param dṛṣṭvā — a direct “seeing” of truth that dissolves all subtle attachments.

# Next Steps

- **Continuing Forward**: Subsequent verses will likely further clarify the nature of insight and its stabilizing role. We will watch how the text continues to integrate ethical, psychological, and philosophical insights into a cohesive spiritual practice culminating in prajñā.

- **Refining the Trajectory**: We have seen pratyāhāra (withdrawal of senses) become refined by insight. Now we anticipate greater emphasis on the stable wisdom that leads to final liberation, suggesting that full-fledged dhāraṇā and dhyāna states are the next logical steps before final samādhi.

---

By analyzing Verse 2.59, we see how mere external restraint is not enough; one must also eliminate the subtle taste (rasa) of attachment through direct realization (paraṃ dṛṣṭvā). This underscores that pratyāhāra is just a stage, and deeper meditative practices culminating in samyama are required for ultimate freedom, aligning perfectly with Śaṅkara’s technical and insightful approach.
