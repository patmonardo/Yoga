## **I. Mūla Verse**

### **Sanskrit**

**न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्
नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो
न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे ॥ २.२० ॥**

### **Transliteration**

**na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin
nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ |
ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇo
na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre || 2.20 ||**

### **Translation**

**"He is not born, nor does He die at any time;
He has not come into being, nor will He come into being again.
Unborn, eternal, changeless, and ancient,
He is not slain when the body is slain."**

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this verse from the Bhagavad Gītā (2.20), **Lord Krishna** continues to impart spiritual wisdom to **Arjuna**, focusing on the immortal and unchanging nature of the **Self** (*Ātman*). The verse elaborates on how the Self transcends the six types of transformations (*ṣaḍ-bhāva-vikāra*) that characterize all material entities in the phenomenal world. **Śaṅkarācārya**, in his commentary (*Bhāṣya*), provides a detailed explanation of each term to clarify why the Self is beyond all modifications and why understanding this is crucial for overcoming grief and delusion.

**कथम् अविक्रिय आत्मा इति द्वितीयो मन्त्रः —**

*"How is the Self unchanging? The following is the second verse:"*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara introduces the question regarding the unchanging nature of the Self and presents the verse that addresses this inquiry.

---

### **2. Negation of Birth**

**न जायते न उत्पद्यते, जनि-लक्षणा वस्तु-विक्रिया न आत्मनः विद्यते इत्यर्थः ।**

*"He is not born (na jāyate), meaning the modification called birth, which is a transformation of an entity, does not exist in the Self—that is the meaning."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **न जायते (na jāyate)**: *Is not born*.
  - **उत्पद्यते (utpadyate)**: *Comes into existence*.
  - **वस्तु-विक्रिया (vastu-vikriyā)**: *Transformation of an entity*.
  - **जनि-लक्षणा (jani-lakṣaṇā)**: *Characterized by birth*.

- **Explanation**: The Self does not undergo the transformation known as birth, which is the coming into existence of an entity that previously did not exist.

---

### **3. Negation of Death**

**तथा न म्रियते वा । वा-शब्दः च-अर्थे । न म्रियते च इति अन्त्या विनाश-लक्षणा विक्रिया प्रतिषिध्यते ।**

*"Similarly, nor does He die (na mriyate vā). The particle 'vā' is used in the sense of 'and'. 'Nor does He die'—here, the final modification characterized by destruction is negated."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **न म्रियते (na mriyate)**: *Does not die*.
  - **वा (vā)**: *And*.
  - **विनाश-लक्षणा विक्रिया (vināśa-lakṣaṇā vikriyā)**: *Modification characterized by destruction*.

- **Explanation**: The Self does not experience death, which is the cessation of existence. The conjunction 'vā' reinforces that both birth and death are negated.

---

### **4. Negation at All Times**

**कदाचित्-शब्दः सर्व-विक्रिया-प्रतिषेधैः सम्बध्यते — न कदाचित् जायते, न कदाचित् म्रियते, इत्येवम् ।**

- **Key Terms**:
  - **कदाचित् (kadācit)**: *At any time*.
  - **सर्व-विक्रिया-प्रतिषेध (sarva-vikriyā-pratiṣedha)**: *Negation of all modifications*.

---

### **5. Not Subject to Becoming Non-Existent**

**यस्मात् अयम् आत्मा भूत्वा भवन-क्रियाम् अनुभूय पश्चात् अभविता अभावं गन्ता न भूयः पुनः, तस्मात् न म्रियते ।**

---

### **6. Not Subject to Birth**

**यो हि अभूत्वा भविता स जायते इति उच्यते । नैवम् आत्मा । अतो न जायते ।**

*"He who, not having been, comes into being is said to be born. The Self is not like this. Therefore, He is not born."*

- **Explanation**: Birth implies coming into existence from non-existence. The Self eternally exists and thus is not born.

---

### **7. Affirmation of Unborn and Eternal Nature**

**यस्माद् एवम्, तस्मात् अजः; यस्मात् न म्रियते, तस्मात् नित्यः च ।**

### **8. Negation of Other Modifications**

**यद्यपि आदि-अन्तयोः विक्रिययोः प्रतिषेधे सर्वा विक्रियाः प्रतिषिद्धा भवन्ति, तथापि मध्य-भाविनीनाṃ विक्रियाणां स्वशब्दैरेव प्रतिषेधः कर्तव्यः, अनुक्तानाम् अपि यौवन-आदि-समस्त-विक्रियाणां प्रतिषेधो यथा स्यात् इति आह — शाश्वत इत्यादिना ।**

*"Even though by negating the modifications at the beginning (birth) and the end (death), all modifications are essentially negated, still, the negation of the modifications that occur in the middle (like growth and decay) must be explicitly stated using specific terms so that even unmentioned modifications like youth and others are negated. Therefore, He says 'śāśvataḥ' (changeless) and so on."*

- **Key Terms**:

*"By 'śāśvataḥ' (changeless), the modification characterized by decay is negated. 'Being ever the same' is 'śāśvataḥ'. He does not decay in His essence because He is without parts (niravayava). Nor does He decay through loss of qualities because He is without qualities (nirguṇa)."*

*"The modification characterized by growth, which is the opposite of decay, is also negated by 'purāṇaḥ' (ancient)."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **वृद्धि (vṛddhi)**: *Growth*.
  - **पुराणः (purāṇaḥ)**: *Ancient, ever new*.

- **Explanation**: Just as the Self does not decay, it also does not grow or increase, emphasizing its constant state.

---

### **11. Explanation of 'Purāṇaḥ'**

**यो हि अवयव-आगमेन उपचीयते स वर्धते अभिनव इति च उच्यते । अयम् तु आत्मा निरवयवत्वात् पुरा अपि नव एव इति पुराणः; न वर्धते इत्यर्थः ।**

*"That which increases through the addition of parts grows and is called 'new' (abhinava). But this Self, being without parts, is ever fresh even in ancient times (purā api nava eva); thus, He is 'purāṇaḥ' (ancient yet new). That is, He does not grow."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **अवयव (avayava)**: *Parts*.
  - **निरवयव (niravayava)**: *Partless*.
  - **अभिनव (abhinava)**: *New*.

- **Explanation**: The Self is ever fresh and unchanging, not subject to growth or aging, hence described as ancient yet ever new.

### **12. Negation of Transformation**

**तथा न हन्यते । हन्ति; अत्र विपरिणाम-अर्थे द्रष्टव्यः, अपुनरुक्ततायै । न विपरिणम्यते इत्यर्थः । हन्यमाने विपरिणम्यमानेऽपि शरीरे ।**

*"Similarly, 'He is not slain' (na hanyate). 'Hanti' here should be understood in the sense of transformation (vipariṇāma), to avoid redundancy. That is, 'He does not undergo transformation,' even when the body is slain or transformed."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **हन्यते (hanyate)**: *Is slain*.
  - **विपरिणाम (vipariṇāma)**: *Transformation*.

- **Explanation**: The Self remains unchanged despite the transformations or destruction of the body.

---

### **13. Summary of the Six Modifications**

**अस्मिन् मन्त्रे षड्-भाव-विकारा लौकिक-वस्तु-विक्रिया आत्मनि प्रतिषिध्यन्ते । सर्व-प्रकार-विक्रिया-रहितः आत्मा इति वाक्यार्थः ।**

*"In this verse, the six modifications (*ṣaḍ-bhāva-vikārāḥ*), which are transformations of worldly entities, are negated with respect to the Self. The meaning is that the Self is devoid of all kinds of modifications."*

- **Six Modifications**:
  1. **अस्ति (asti)**: Existence.
  2. **जयते (jayate)**: Birth.
  3. **वर्धते (vardhate)**: Growth.
  4. **परिणमते (pariṇamate)**: Transformation.
  5. **अपक्षीयते (apakṣīyate)**: Decline.
  6. **विनश्यति (vinaśyati)**: Destruction.

---

### **14. Connection with Previous Verse**

**यस्माद् एवम्, तस्मात् 'उभौ तौ न विजानीतः' इति पूर्वेण मन्त्रेण अस्य सम्बन्धः ॥ २० ॥**

*"Because it is so, therefore, this verse is connected with the previous verse, 'Both of them do not know' (ubhau tau na vijānītaḥ)."*

- **Explanation**: Understanding the Self's unchanging nature clarifies why those who see the Self as a killer or killed do not truly know its essence.

---

## **IV. Term Analysis**

### **1. Unborn (अजः - ajaḥ)**

- **Explanation**: The Self has no beginning and is not born at any time.
- **Significance**: Birth implies a prior non-existence, which does not apply to the eternal Self.

### **2. Eternal (नित्यः - nityaḥ)**

- **Explanation**: The Self exists at all times without interruption.
- **Significance**: Eternity underscores the timeless nature of the Self, unaffected by temporal changes.

### **3. Changeless (शाश्वतः - śāśvataḥ)**

- **Explanation**: The Self remains the same without any modification or decay.
- **Significance**: Changelessness denotes stability and immutability, essential qualities of the Self.

### **4. Ancient (पुराणः - purāṇaḥ)**

- **Explanation**: Although ancient, the Self is ever fresh and new.
- **Significance**: Combines timelessness with perpetual freshness, indicating the Self's transcendence over time.

### **5. Not Slain (न हन्यते - na hanyate)**

- **Explanation**: The Self is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.
- **Significance**: Emphasizes that physical death does not affect the Self.

---

## **V. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Negation of the Six Modifications**

- **Birth and Death**: The Self is neither born nor does it die.
- **Growth and Decay**: The Self does not grow or decay because it is partless and without attributes.
- **Transformation**: The Self does not undergo any transformation.
- **Existence**: The Self's existence is constant; it does not come into being nor cease to be.

### **2. Implications of Being Partless and Attributeless**

- **Partlessness (निरवयवत्वात्)**: Lacking parts, the Self cannot undergo physical changes like assembly or disassembly.
- **Attributelessness (निर्गुणत्वात्)**: Without qualities, the Self does not change due to alteration in attributes.

### **3. Timelessness of the Self**

- **Beyond Time**: The Self is not bound by past, present, or future.
- **Eternal Presence**: Always existing, the Self is not subject to temporal processes.

### **4. Connection to Previous Teachings**

- **Error of Misidentification**: Misunderstanding the Self as capable of action (killing) or being acted upon (being killed) arises from ignorance.
- **Knowledge as Liberation**: Realizing the Self's true nature frees one from grief and delusion.

---

## **VI. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Advaita Vedānta Perspective**

- **Non-Dual Reality**: The Self is the singular, non-dual reality underlying all existence.
- **Illusory Nature of Phenomena**: Birth, death, and other modifications are attributes of the material world, not the Self.

### **2. Nature of the Self**

- **Immutable Consciousness**: The Self is pure consciousness that does not change.
- **Witness**: The Self is the observer, unaffected by the activities of the body and mind.

### **3. Overcoming Ignorance**

- **Ignorance (Avidyā)**: Mistaking the body and mind for the Self leads to suffering.
- **Knowledge (Vidya)**: Understanding the Self's true nature is the path to liberation.

---

## **VII. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Self-Inquiry**

- **Questioning Identity**: Regularly ask, "Who am I?" to discern the Self from the body and mind.
- **Meditation**: Practice meditation to experience the unchanging Self beyond thoughts and sensations.

### **2. Cultivating Detachment**

- **Witness Consciousness**: Observe bodily changes and mental fluctuations without identifying with them.
- **Acceptance of Impermanence**: Recognize that all material entities undergo change, but the Self remains constant.

### **3. Overcoming Fear of Death**

- **Understanding Immortality**: Realize that the Self is not subject to birth or death.
- **Living Fearlessly**: Embrace life fully, knowing that the true Self is indestructible.

### **4. Ethical Living**

- **Compassion**: Seeing the same Self in all beings fosters empathy and kindness.
- **Right Action**: Engage in actions aligned with dharma (righteousness), free from attachment to outcomes.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

In this profound verse and Śaṅkara's commentary, the essential teaching is the **immutable and eternal nature of the Self**. The Self transcends all six types of modifications that characterize material existence: birth, existence, growth, transformation, decay, and destruction. By negating these, the text emphasizes that the Self is **unborn, undying, changeless, and ever-present**.

Understanding this truth is crucial for spiritual seekers. It dismantles the identification with the body and mind, which are subject to change and decay, and reveals the **unchanging reality** that is the Self. This realization leads to liberation from fear, sorrow, and the cycle of birth and death. It encourages one to live with awareness, compassion, and alignment with the highest truth.
