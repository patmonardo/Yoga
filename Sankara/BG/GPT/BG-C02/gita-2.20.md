### **Translation (with Commentary)**:

In this verse, Krishna describes the **eternal nature of the Self (Atman)**, which is beyond birth, death, and any form of destruction. He explains:

- **"na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit"**: The Self neither **is born** (jāyate) nor **dies** (mriyate) at any time. This emphasizes the eternal, indestructible nature of the Self, unaffected by the cyclical processes of birth and death that govern the body.

- **"nāyaṁ bhūtvābhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ"**: The Self does not **become** (bhūtvā) or **cease to be** (abhavitā), and once it has come into existence in its true form, it does not undergo destruction or re-emergence in a finite sense.

- **"ajo nityaḥ śāśvato'yaṁ purāṇo"**: The Self is **eternal** (nitya), **imperishable** (śāśvata), and **ancient** (purāṇa), without any limitation in time or condition.

- **"na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre"**: The Self is not **killed** (hanyate) when the body is killed (hanyamāne śarīre). This emphasizes that **the true Self** is beyond the physical body, and physical death does not affect its true nature.

### **Key Concepts & Analysis**:

1. **Transcendence of the Self**: This verse solidifies the idea that **Atman** (the true Self) is separate from the **body**, which is temporary and perishable. In **Buddhist Abhidharma** and **Samkhya Yoga**, this concept aligns with the notion of **permanent consciousness (Purusha)**, where the **finite body** is seen as distinct from the **eternal, unchanging essence** of the Self.

2. **Aja (Unborn) and Anitya (Non-dying)**: The term **"Aja" (unborn)** reinforces the idea that the Self is **not subject to birth or death**. The distinction made here can be traced back to **Samkhya Yoga's** idea of **Purusha** as the unchanging, eternal witness, while the **body (Prakriti)** goes through cycles of creation, destruction, and transformation.

3. **Shāśvata (Eternal) and Purāṇa (Ancient)**: **Shāśvata** emphasizes the **permanent and unchanging nature** of the Self, beyond the fluctuations of time. The concept of **Purāṇa** suggests that, though the Self is ancient and beyond time, it is **always fresh** in its awareness. This is closely tied to the **Buddhist view of "eternal present"**, where the Self remains constant despite changing experiences.

4. **Non-violence and Deconstruction of Dualism**: By stating that the Self is **not affected by the killing of the body**, Krishna is refuting the **materialistic view** that equates the soul with the body. The idea that the **Self is imperishable** even if the body is destroyed echoes the **non-dualism (Advaita)** taught by **Śaṅkara** and aligns with **Samkhya's view** that the **Self is distinct from the material world (Prakriti)**.

5. **Antahkarana and Satkarya Model**: In the context of **Antahkarana** and **Satkarya**, the **Self (Purusha)** is the **witness** of all actions, while the **body (Prakriti)** performs the actual actions (birth, death, etc.). The Self remains unchanged throughout the various processes in the material world. This dynamic relationship highlights the **non-transactional** aspect of the Self (Antahkarana's role as the controller of actions).

6. **Kantian Relevance**: The philosophical insight expressed here has **resonance with Kant’s ideas** of **the "noumenal"** (the thing-in-itself, which remains unchanged) versus the **phenomenal** (the world of appearances). The Self, being the **noumenon**, remains untouched by the transitory world of physical actions.

### **Connection to Previous Verse**:

This verse continues the **concept of the indestructible Self**, which was introduced in **Verse 19** where Lord Krishna emphasized that the Self does **not kill** or **get killed**. **Verse 20** elaborates further by clarifying that the Self is not born and does not die, thus strengthening the distinction between the **perishable body** and the **imperishable soul**.
