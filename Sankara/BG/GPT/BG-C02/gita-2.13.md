**tatra katham iva nitya ātmīti dṛṣṭāntam āha —**
**dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṃ yauvanaṃ jarā.**
**tathā dehāntaraprāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati.** (13)

---

**Explanation of the Passage:**

This verse from the **Bhagavad Gita** (2.13) is a direct continuation of Lord Krishna's teaching about the **eternal nature of the soul (Atman)**. Krishna uses a **simple but powerful analogy** to explain how the soul transitions from one body to another without being affected by the **changes** it experiences through various stages of life. Let us break this down:

---

1. **"Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṃ yauvanaṃ jarā."**
   "Just as in this body, the boyhood, youth, and old age come to pass, similarly, the attaining of another body is inevitable for the wise."

   - **"Dehino 'smin"** refers to the **soul (Atman)** residing within the body. Krishna is pointing out that the **soul** itself is constant, while the body undergoes **different stages of life**.
   - He uses **three stages** of the body—**boyhood (kaumāra)**, **youth (yauvana)**, and **old age (jarā)**—to demonstrate that just as the body changes from one state to another, the **soul** is unaffected by these transformations.
   - The **body** goes through **stages of growth** and **decay** (childhood, youth, and old age), but the **soul remains unchanging**, witnessing these changes.

2. **"Tathā dehāntaraprāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati."**
   "Similarly, the wise person, who knows the truth, does not become deluded when they obtain another body."

   - Krishna now shifts the analogy to the **death of the body** and the **rebirth of the soul**. The soul, just like it transitions through different stages of life within the same body, also transitions into a **new body** after the old one perishes.
   - The wise person, who is **aware of the soul’s eternal nature**, understands that the soul is not affected by the **death** of the body and is not deluded by the changes. **The soul is eternal, and thus there is no reason to grieve over the inevitable cycle of birth and death**.
   - **"Dhīras"** (the wise or prudent) refers to someone who understands the **transcendental wisdom** that the soul is separate from the body. Such a person does not fall into **delusion (muhyati)** because they recognize the soul’s imperishable nature.

---

### **Philosophical Significance:**

1. **The Illusion of Death:**
   Krishna is teaching **Arjuna** that **death is an illusion** as it pertains to the **soul**. The **soul is eternal**, it is not born and it does not die. What appears to be death is simply the **transformation of the body** from one form to another. Just as the body transitions from **childhood** to **youth** to **old age**, it also transitions into a new body at the time of **death**. The soul, however, does not undergo these changes.

2. **Analogy of the Changing Stages of Life:**
   Krishna uses the analogy of the **changing states of the body** (from childhood to old age) to explain that the **soul** undergoes no such transformation. The **soul** is beyond the limitations of time, space, and physical form. It is not subject to birth, growth, or decay as the body is.

   - The **soul’s** passage from one body to another is likened to the **passage of the body through different stages of life**. Just as a person grows from a child to a youth, and then to old age, the soul **experiences** different bodies (through birth and death) without changing its inherent **nature**.

3. **The Wisdom of the Detached Soul:**
   The **wise person (dhīra)** is someone who is not **attached** to the physical body and **understands the distinction** between the body and the soul. Such a person is not deluded by the outward changes of the material world, including **death**. They recognize that **the soul is eternal**, and thus, the death of the body is not an end, but a continuation of the soul’s journey in another form.

4. **Transcendence of the Soul:**
   The verse highlights the teaching of **Atman** as **immortal** and **eternal**. Death is only the end of the physical body, not of the self (Atman). This idea reinforces the **Vedantic teaching** that the **self (Atman)** is eternal and beyond the material world. The body is perishable, but the soul remains **immutable** and **indestructible**. This understanding brings a person to a state of **peace** and **detachment**.

### **Key Takeaway:**

In this verse, **Lord Krishna** teaches that the **soul** (Atman) is beyond **birth and death**, much like how one experiences different stages of life in the same body. The soul is **unchanging** and **eternal**, while the body undergoes **constant transformation**. Just as the body changes through the stages of childhood, youth, and old age, the soul transitions into a new body at the time of death without being affected. The **wise person** recognizes this truth and, therefore, is **not deluded** or affected by the changes in the material world.

This teaching is meant to **free Arjuna from his attachment** to the body and the fear of **death**, encouraging him to act selflessly and in accordance with **his dharma** (righteous duty) without concern for the fate of the physical form.

**Transliteration:**

**yadyapi ātmavināśanimitto moho na sambhavati nitya ātmā iti vijānataḥ, tathāpi śītoṣṇasukhaduḥkhaprāptinimittō moho laukikō dṛśyate, sukhaviyōganimittō mōhaḥ duḥkhasaṁyōganimittashcha śōkḥ | ityetad arjunasya vacanam āśaṅkya bhagavān āha —**

**āgamāpāyinō 'nityāstān titikṣasva bhārata || 14 ||**

### **Translation and Explanation:**

Lord Krishna, in the **Bhagavad Gita**, addresses the transient nature of physical experiences such as pleasure and pain. Arjuna has voiced concerns about the suffering caused by worldly circumstances, including the separation from the loved ones and the grief he experiences from the potential loss of those who are dear to him. In response to this, Krishna explains that although the **eternal soul (Atman)** is unaffected by death and remains imperishable, the **attachments** to the physical world can still create **miseries**. Here, he gives a practical teaching regarding dealing with worldly phenomena.

1. **"Yadyapi ātmavināśanimitto moho na sambhavati nitya ātmā iti vijānataḥ, tathāpi śītoṣṇasukhaduḥkhaprāptinimittō moho laukikō dṛśyate, sukhaviyōganimittō mōhaḥ duḥkhasaṁyōganimittashcha śōkḥ."**

   - Krishna acknowledges that, for those who recognize the **eternal nature of the soul (Atman)**, **attachment** to the physical body and its perishable experiences does not lead to delusion about the ultimate reality. The soul, being eternal and unchanging, remains unaffected by physical death.
   - **However, Krishna acknowledges that worldly delusion (moha)** still exists due to the emotional attachments to experiences such as **pleasure (sukha)**, **pain (duḥkha)**, and **climate-based fluctuations (śīta and uṣṇa)**. These worldly experiences often result in attachment to **pleasure** and **grief** (śokḥ), which are the result of **attachment** to sensory pleasures and **the fear of losing them**.
   - Specifically, **moha (delusion)** is born of the attachment to worldly pleasures and pain—**pleasure lost or grief born from the association with suffering**.

2. **"Mātrāspṛśāstu kaunteya śītoṣṇasukhaduḥkhadāḥ | āgamāpāyinō 'nityāstān titikṣasva bhārata || 14 ||"**

   - **"Mātrās"** refers to the **senses** (such as hearing, touching, seeing, etc.). These are the ways by which the body interacts with the world, perceiving the **contact** or **sensory stimuli** (spṛśā) from various **objects** or **experiences**.
   - **"Śītoṣṇa, sukha, duḥkha"**—these are all the experiences of the body: **cold (śīta)**, **heat (uṣṇa)**, **pleasure (sukha)**, and **pain (duḥkha)**, which arise from sensory interactions with the material world.
   - Krishna tells Arjuna that all these experiences are **temporary** and **transitory** (**āgamāpāyinah**, meaning "those which arise and disappear"). They are **impermanent**, and therefore **they should not be clung to**.
   - **"Titikṣasva"**—Krishna advises Arjuna to **endure** (tolerate) these fluctuations of pleasure and pain, heat and cold, because they are **temporary** and **will pass**. The proper attitude is to **tolerate** them with **equanimity**.

---

### **Key Insights:**

1. **The Nature of Sensory Experiences:**
   Krishna categorizes the sensory experiences (such as heat, cold, pleasure, pain) as **impermanent** phenomena that are temporary and cyclical. Just as **day follows night**, these experiences come and go in cycles, and there is no lasting substance to them. Therefore, one should not become overly attached to any of them.

2. **The Role of **Detachment**:
   Krishna emphasizes that worldly attachments, such as attachment to **pleasure** or **pain**, cause **delusion (moha)**. These attachments lead to grief (śokḥ) when **pleasures are lost** or **pain is suffered**. The wise individual, however, who **understands the temporary nature** of these sensory experiences, is able to remain **detached** and **equanimous** regardless of circumstances.

3. **Tolerating Impermanence (Titikṣa):**
   Krishna urges Arjuna to **bear** these experiences with **fortitude and patience**. As the experiences are fleeting, one should learn to **tolerate** them without getting swept away by them emotionally. This is a practical teaching on **mindfulness** and **detachment**, advising one not to be overly affected by the ups and downs of material life.

4. **Emotional Equanimity (Upekṣa):**
   The teaching of **titikṣa** (tolerance) encourages **emotional equanimity**. One should not let the enjoyment of sensory pleasures or the fear of sensory pain disturb their inner peace. By doing so, one can cultivate a steady mind and focus on higher spiritual goals, like **self-realization** (Atman-jnana).

---

### **Philosophical Implication:**

This verse underscores the **impermanence** of the material world and stresses the importance of **inner balance** and **detachment**. Krishna’s teaching is that although the **eternal soul** is beyond all pain and pleasure, the **temporary body** and its sensory experiences will continue to cause discomfort if one does not approach them with the right attitude. The goal is to transcend the emotional rollercoaster caused by attachment to these temporary experiences, recognizing that true peace lies in **self-realization** and in understanding the **eternal nature of the soul**.
