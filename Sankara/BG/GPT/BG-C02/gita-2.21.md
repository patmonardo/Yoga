## **I. Mūla Verse**

### **Sanskrit**
```
वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम् ।
कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् ॥ २.२१ ॥
```
### **Transliteration**
```
vedāvināśinaṁ nityaṁ ya enam ajam avyayam |
kathaṁ sa puruṣaḥ pārtha kaṁ ghātayati hanti kam || 2.21 ||
```
### **Translation**

**"He who knows this Self as indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable—how can that person, O Pārtha (Arjuna), cause anyone to be killed or kill anyone?"**

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this verse, **Lord Krishna** concludes the teaching that began with the statement that the Self neither kills nor is killed (Verse 2.19). After establishing the **immutability of the Self** as the reason (Verse 2.20), He now reinforces the conclusion that one who truly understands the Self's nature cannot see themselves as the agent of killing or as causing someone else to be killed.

**Śaṅkarācārya**, in his commentary, explains how this verse ties together the previous arguments. By first stating the proposition that the Self is neither the doer nor the object of the act of killing, and then providing the reason of the Self's unchanging nature, the Lord now summarizes and concludes the intended teaching.

## **III. Translation and Analysis of Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya**

### **1. Introduction to the Verse**

**‘य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारम्’ (भ. गी. २ । १९) इत्यनेन मन्त्रेण हननक्रियायाः कर्ता कर्म च न भवति इति प्रतिज्ञाय, ‘न जायते’ इत्यनेन अविक्रियत्वं हेतुम् उक्त्वा प्रतिज्ञात-अर्थम् उपसंहरति —**

*"By the verse 'He who thinks this Self to be the slayer' (Bh. Gī. 2.19), having stated the proposition that the Self is neither the agent nor the object of the act of killing, and by 'He is not born' (Bh. Gī. 2.20), having given the reason of the Self's unchanging nature, He concludes the intended meaning."*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara outlines how the previous verses have established that the Self is neither the doer nor the object of action due to its immutable nature. Now, the conclusion of this teaching is presented in Verse 2.21.

---

### **2. Quoting the Verse**

**वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनम् अजम् अव्ययम् ।
कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् ॥ २.२१ ॥**

*"He who knows this Self as indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable—how can that person, O Pārtha (Arjuna), cause anyone to be killed or kill anyone?"*

---

### **3. Detailed Commentary**

#### **a. Knowing the Self**

**यः एनम् आत्मानम् अविनाशिनं नित्यम् अजम् अव्ययम् वेद जानाति ।**

*"He who knows this Self as indestructible (avināśinam), eternal (nityam), unborn (ajam), and immutable (avyayam)."*

- **Explanation**: The person who has realized the true nature of the Self, understanding it to be beyond destruction, eternal, without birth, and unchanging.

#### **b. Questioning the Possibility of Killing**

**कथं स पुरुषः कं घातयति, हन्ति कम् इति ।**

*"How can that person cause anyone to be killed, or kill anyone?"*

- **Explanation**: Such a person, understanding the Self's true nature, cannot conceive of themselves as killing or causing someone else to be killed.

#### **c. Elaboration**

**एतदुक्तं भवति — आत्मनः अविनाशित्वादिकं यो वेद, स सर्वकर्मकृत्वादिकम् आत्मनि न पश्यति; तस्मात् कथं कं घातयति, हन्ति वा कम् इत्यर्थः ।**

*"The meaning is this: He who knows the indestructibility and other attributes of the Self does not see in the Self the state of being the doer of all actions, etc. Therefore, how can he cause anyone to be killed, or kill anyone—that is the meaning."*

- **Explanation**: Knowing the Self to be actionless and immutable, one realizes that actions like killing cannot be attributed to the Self.

- **Self Does Not Kill**: Since the Self is actionless, it cannot perform the act of killing.
- **Self Is Not Killed**: Being indestructible, the Self cannot be destroyed or killed.
- **Misidentification**: Believing that one can kill or be killed arises from misidentifying the Self with the body.

### **3. Practical Implications for Arjuna**

### **4. Overcoming Fear and Suffering**

- **Transcend Fear of Death**: Realize that the Self is immortal, alleviating fear associated with mortality.
- **Manage Emotions**: Understanding the Self's unchanging nature helps in managing grief and anxiety.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

In Verse 2.21 of the Bhagavad Gītā, **Lord Krishna** reinforces the teaching that the **Self is beyond action**. **Śaṅkarācārya** explains that one who truly knows the Self as **indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable** recognizes that the Self does not engage in actions like killing nor is it affected by them.

This understanding has profound implications:

- **Dispelling Ignorance**: Knowledge of the Self removes the mistaken identification with the body and mind.
- **Ethical Conduct**: Recognizing the Self in all beings leads to compassionate and non-violent actions.
- **Performing Duty**: One can perform duties without attachment, understanding that actions do not taint the Self.

## **I. Sanskrit Passage**

**वे**द विजानाति अविनाशिनम् अन्त्य-भाव-विकार-रहितं नित्यं विपरिणाम-रहितं यो वेद इति सम्बन्धः ।
**एनं** पूर्वेण मन्त्रेण उक्त-लक्षणम् अजम् जन्म-रहितम् अव्ययम् अपक्षय-रहितं ।
**कथं** केन प्रकारेण सः विद्वान् पुरुषः अधिकृतः हन्ति हनन-क्रियां करोति, कथं वा घातयति हन्तारं प्रयोजयति ।
**न** कथञ्चित् कञ्चित् हन्ति, न कथञ्चित् कञ्चित् घातयति इति उभयत्र आक्षेप एवार्थः, प्रश्न-अर्थ-असम्भवात् ।
**हेत्वर्थस्य** च अविक्रियत्वस्य तुल्यत्वात् विदुषः सर्व-कर्म-प्रतिषेध एव प्रकरणार्थः अभिप्रेतो भगवता ।
**हन्तेः** तु आक्षेपः उदाहरण-अर्थत्वेन कथितः ॥

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** continues his commentary on **Bhagavad Gītā 2.21**. He elaborates on the verse, explaining how one who knows the **Self** (*Ātman*) as indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable cannot engage in actions like killing or causing killing. Śaṅkara analyzes the relationship between knowledge of the Self and the impossibility of seeing oneself as an agent of action.

---

## **III. Translation and Analysis of the Bhāṣya**

### **1. The Knower of the Self**

**वेद विजानाति अविनाशिनम् अन्त्य-भाव-विकार-रहितं नित्यं विपरिणाम-रहितं यो वेद इति सम्बन्धः ।**

*The one who knows (veda), understands (vijānāti) the Self as indestructible (avināśinam), devoid of the final modification characterized by destruction (antya-bhāva-vikāra-rahitam), eternal (nityam), free from transformation (vipariṇāma-rahitam)—this is the connection (between 'veda' and the rest of the sentence).*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara emphasizes that the person who knows the Self as indestructible and unchanging has a specific understanding of its characteristics. The term 'veda' (knows) is connected with knowing the Self as described.

### **2. Description of the Self**

**एनं पूर्वेण मन्त्रेण उक्त-लक्षणम् अजम् जन्म-रहितम् अव्ययम् अपक्षय-रहितम् ।**

*This (enam) Self, as characterized in the previous verse, is unborn (ajam), devoid of birth, and immutable (avyayam), free from decay.*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **एनम् (enam)**: *This*; referring to the Self under discussion.
  - **पूर्वेण मन्त्रेण उक्त-लक्षणम् (pūrveṇa mantreṇa ukta-lakṣaṇam)**: *Characterized as described in the previous verse*.
  - **अजम् (ajam)**: *Unborn*.
  - **अव्ययम् (avyayam)**: *Immutable*.
  - **अपक्षय-रहितम् (apakṣaya-rahitam)**: *Free from decay or diminution*.

- **Explanation**: The Self is being referred to with the qualities already described—unborn and immutable.

### **3. Questioning the Possibility of Killing**

**कथं केन प्रकारेण सः विद्वान् पुरुषः अधिकृतः हन्ति हनन-क्रियां करोति, कथं वा घातयति हन्तारं प्रयोजयति ।**

*How (katham), in what way (kena prakāreṇa), does that wise person (saḥ vidvān puruṣaḥ), who is entitled (adhikṛtaḥ), kill (hanti), perform the act of killing (hanana-kriyāṁ karoti), or how indeed does he cause to be killed (ghātayati), engage someone else as a killer (hantāraṁ prayojayati)?*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara raises the question of how a person who knows the Self's true nature can engage in killing or causing others to kill.

### **4. The Impossibility of Killing**

**न कथञ्चित् कञ्चित् हन्ति, न कथञ्चित् कञ्चित् घातयति इति उभयत्र आक्षेप एवा अर्थः, प्रश्न-अर्थ-असम्भवात् ।**

*He does not in any way (na kathañcit) kill anyone (kañcit hanti), nor does he in any way cause anyone to be killed (na kathañcit kañcit ghātayati); thus, in both cases, the meaning is a denial (ākṣepa eva arthaḥ), since the literal question sense is impossible (praśna-artha-asambhavāt).*

- **Explanation**: The rhetorical questions imply a denial; it's impossible for the knower of the Self to kill or cause killing.

### **5. Equal Applicability of the Reason**

**हेत्वर्थस्य च अविक्रियत्वस्य तुल्यत्वात् विदुषः सर्व-कर्म-प्रतिषेध एव प्रकरण-अर्थः अभिप्रेतः भगवता ।**

*And because the reason (hetvarthasya) of the Self's unchanging nature (avikriyatvasya) applies equally (tulyatvāt), the intended meaning (abhipretaḥ) by the Blessed Lord (bhagavatā) in this context (prakaraṇa-arthaḥ) is indeed the complete negation (sarva-karma-pratiṣedha) of all actions for the wise person (viduṣaḥ).*

- **Explanation**: Since the unchanging nature of the Self is the reason, and it applies to all actions equally, the Lord intends to convey that the wise person is negated from all actions.

### **6. Use of 'Killing' as an Example**

**हन्तेः तु आक्षेपः उदाहरण-अर्थत्वेन कथितः ॥**

*But the denial (ākṣepaḥ) regarding 'killing' (hanteḥ) is stated as an example (udāharaṇa-arthatvena).*

- **Explanation**: The act of killing is used as a representative example to illustrate the broader principle of non-doership.

---

### **7. अव्ययम् (avyayam)**: *Immutable*

- **Explanation**: Not subject to decay or alteration.

### **8. कथम् (katham)**: *How*

- **Explanation**: Questioning the possibility or manner.

- **Explanation**: One who has knowledge of the Self.

### **10. हन्ति (hanti)**: *Kills*

- **Explanation**: Performs the act of killing.

### **12. आक्षेप (ākṣepa)**: *Denial or refutation*

- **Explanation**: Rejecting the possibility; here, implying impossibility.

### **13. प्रश्न-अर्थ-असम्भवात् (praśna-artha-asambhavāt)**: *Because the literal question sense is impossible*

- **Explanation**: Since the question cannot be taken literally, it indicates a denial.

### **14. अविक्रियत्व (avikriyatva)**: *Unchanging nature*

- **Explanation**: The state of being unchangeable.

### **15. सर्व-कर्म-प्रतिषेध (sarva-karma-pratiṣedha)**: *Complete negation of all actions*

---

## **V. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Understanding the Connection**

- **Knowledge of the Self**: The one who knows the Self as indestructible and immutable has a specific understanding of its nature.
- **Connection in the Sentence**: The verb 'veda' (knows) connects to knowing the Self with these qualities.

### **2. The Impossibility of Action for the Wise**

- **Actionless Self**: Since the Self is unchanging and actionless, the wise person realizes that the Self cannot be the agent of action.
- **Denial of Killing**: The rhetorical question implies that it's impossible for the knower of the Self to engage in killing or causing killing.

### **3. Universal Application**

- **Reason Applies Equally**: The reason—the Self's unchanging nature—applies to all actions, not just killing.
- **Negation of All Actions**: The implication is that the wise person is beyond all notions of doership.

### **4. Use of 'Killing' as a Representative Action**

- **Illustrative Purpose**: Killing is used as a prominent example to represent all actions.
- **Focus on Doership**: The discussion centers on the concept of agency and doership, not just the specific act.

---

## **VI. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Non-Doership in Advaita Vedānta**

- **Self as Non-Agent**: The Self does not act nor is it affected by actions.
- **Illusion of Doership**: The sense of being a doer arises from ignorance and identification with the body-mind complex.

### **2. Liberation Through Knowledge**

- **Knowledge Dispels Ignorance**: Understanding the true nature of the Self frees one from the illusion of doership.
- **Freedom from Karma**: Realizing non-doership absolves one from the binding effects of actions.

### **3. Ethical Conduct**

- **Action Without Attachment**: The wise person performs actions without egoistic attachment, understanding that the Self is not the doer.
- **Compassion and Non-Violence**: Recognizing the Self in all beings fosters compassion and reduces the propensity to harm others.

### **4. Practical Implications for Spiritual Seekers**

- **Self-Inquiry**: Encourages seekers to investigate the true nature of the Self.
- **Detachment from Actions**: Cultivates detachment from the fruits of actions and from the identification with being the doer.

---

## **VII. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Cultivating Knowledge of the Self**

- **Study and Contemplation**: Engage deeply with scriptures and teachings on the nature of the Self.
- **Meditation**: Practice meditation to experience the Self's unchanging presence.

### **2. Disidentification with the Body-Mind**

- **Witness Consciousness**: Observe actions and thoughts without identification.
- **Letting Go of Ego**: Recognize that the ego is not the true Self.

### **3. Ethical Living**

- **Non-Violence (Ahimsa)**: Practice non-violence, understanding that harming others is based on ignorance of the Self.
- **Selfless Service**: Perform actions as service without attachment to outcomes.

### **4. Overcoming the Illusion of Doership**

- **Mindful Action**: Be aware that actions occur within the field of nature (Prakriti), and the Self remains the uninvolved witness.
- **Surrender to Higher Will**: Cultivate an attitude of surrender, recognizing that the ultimate doer is the divine.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** explains that one who truly knows the **Self** as indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable cannot see themselves as performing actions like killing or causing killing. The Self's **unchanging nature** implies that it is not the agent of action. The rhetorical questions in the verse serve as a denial of the possibility of the wise person engaging in such actions.

The **philosophical implication** is that **knowledge of the Self leads to the negation of doership**. This understanding frees one from the binding effects of karma and leads to liberation. The act of killing is used as an example to illustrate the broader principle that the Self does not engage in any action.

For **spiritual practitioners**, this teaching emphasizes the importance of **self-inquiry**, **disidentification from the ego**, and **ethical living** rooted in the recognition of the Self's true nature.

---

## **IX. Next Steps**

## **I. Sanskrit Passage**

**विदुषः कं कर्मासम्भवहेतुविशेषं पश्यन् कर्माण्याक्षिपति भगवान् ‘कथं स पुरुषः’ इति ।
ननु उक्त एव आत्मनः अविक्रियत्वं सर्वकर्मासम्भवकारणविशेषः ।
सत्यम् उक्तः ।
न तु सः कारणविशेषः, अन्यत्वात् विदुषः अविक्रियाद् आत्मनः ।
न हि अविक्रियं स्थाणुं विदितवतः कर्म न सम्भवति इति चेत्,
न; विदुषः आत्मत्वात् ।
न देहादि-सङ्घातस्य विद्वत्ता ।
अतः पारिशेष्यात् असंहतः आत्मा विद्वान् अविक्रियः इति तस्य विदुषः कर्मासम्भवात् आक्षेपो युक्तः ‘कथं स पुरुषः’ इति ।
यथा बुद्ध्याद्याहृतस्य शब्दाद्यर्थस्य अविक्रिय एव सन् बुद्धि-वृत्ति-अविवेक-विज्ञानेन अविद्यया उपलभ्यते आत्मा कल्प्यते,

विदुषः कर्मासम्भव-वचनात् यानि कर्माणि शास्त्रेण विधीयन्ते तानि अविदुषः विहितानि इति भगवतः निश्चयोऽवगम्यते ॥**

---

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** continues his commentary on **Bhagavad Gītā 2.21**. He delves deeper into the implications of the verse, particularly focusing on why the **Lord (Bhagavān)** denies the possibility of action for the **wise person (viduṣaḥ)** by saying, "How can that person...?" Śaṅkara explores the special reason that makes action impossible for the wise and addresses potential objections regarding the relationship between the unchanging Self and the knower. He concludes by emphasizing that actions prescribed by the scriptures are intended for the ignorant, not the wise.

---

## **III. Translation and Analysis of the Bhāṣya**

### **1. Questioning the Denial of Action for the Wise**

**विदुषः कं कर्मासम्भवहेतुविशेषं पश्यन् कर्माणि आक्षिपति भगवान् ‘कथं स पुरुषः’ इति ।**

*"Seeing what special reason for the impossibility of action in the case of the wise person (viduṣaḥ) does the Lord deny actions by saying 'How can that person...'?*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara raises a question about the basis on which the Lord asserts that the wise person cannot engage in action. What is the specific reason that makes action impossible for the wise?

### **2. Potential Objection**

**ननु उक्त एव आत्मनः अविक्रियत्वं सर्वकर्मासम्भवकारणविशेषः ।**

*"But the unchanging nature of the Self has already been stated as the specific reason for the impossibility of all actions."*

- **Explanation**: An objector might argue that the Self's unchanging nature is the reason actions are impossible for the wise person, and this has already been mentioned.

### **3. Acknowledging the Point but Highlighting a Distinction**

**सत्यम् उक्तः । न तु सः कारणविशेषः, अन्यत्वात् विदुषः अविक्रियाद् आत्मनः ।**

*"True, it has been said. But that is not a special reason because the knower (viduṣaḥ) is different from the unchanging Self."*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara agrees that the unchanging nature of the Self has been stated but points out that this is not a special reason concerning the wise person, as the knower is considered different from the unchanging Self.

### **4. Refuting the Objection**

**न हि अविक्रियं स्थाणुं विदितवतः कर्म न सम्भवति इति चेत, न; विदुषः आत्मत्वात् ।**

*"If it is argued that action does not occur for one who knows an unchanging post (sthāṇu), that is not so; because the knower is the Self."*

- **Explanation**: The objector might say that just as knowing an unchanging object like a post doesn't prevent action, knowing the unchanging Self shouldn't prevent action. Śaṅkara refutes this by stating that the knower is the Self itself, not separate from it.

### **5. Identifying the Knower as the Self**

**न देहादि-सङ्घातस्य विद्वत्ता । अतः पारिशेष्यात् असंहतः आत्मा विद्वान् अविक्रियः इति तस्य विदुषः कर्मासम्भवात् आक्षेपो युक्तः ‘कथं स पुरुषः’ इति ।**

*"The aggregate of body and so on (deha-ādi-saṅghāta) is not the knower. Therefore, by elimination, the unassociated Self (asaṁhataḥ ātmā), being the knower and unchanging, makes the denial of action for that wise person appropriate, as in 'How can that person...?'"*

- **Explanation**: Since the body-mind complex is not the true knower, the Self remains as the unchanging knower. Therefore, denying the possibility of action for the wise person is justified.

### **6. Analogy of Perception through Ignorance**

**यथा बुद्ध्याद्याहृतस्य शब्दाद्यर्थस्य अविक्रिय एव सन् बुद्धि-वृत्ति-अविवेक-विज्ञानेन अविद्यया उपलभ्यते आत्मा कल्प्यते,**

*"Just as the Self, being truly unchanging, is imagined to be the perceiver of objects like sound, etc., brought about by the intellect (buddhi) and so on, through ignorance (avidyā) due to non-discrimination between the mental modifications and the Self,"*

- **Explanation**: In ordinary perception, the unchanging Self appears to perceive objects due to ignorance, which conflates the mind's activities with the Self.

### **7. Similarity in the Knowledge of the Wise**

**एवम् एव आत्म-अनात्म-विवेक-ज्ञानेन बुद्धि-वृत्त्या विद्यया असत्य-रूपया एव परमार्थतः अविक्रिय एव आत्मा विद्वान् उच्यते ।**

*"Similarly, through the mental modification (buddhi-vṛtti) which is knowledge (vidyā) involving discrimination between Self and not-Self, the Self, being truly unchanging, is called the 'knower' only in an unreal sense."*

- **Explanation**: Even in the knowledge that discriminates between the Self and not-Self, the Self is referred to as the 'knower' in a figurative sense, while in reality, it remains unchanging.

### **8. Conclusion about Actions Prescribed by Scriptures**

**विदुषः कर्मासम्भव-वचनात् यानि कर्माणि शास्त्रेण विधीयन्ते तानि अविदुषः विहितानि इति भगवतः निश्चयोऽवगम्यते ॥**

*"From the statement of the impossibility of action for the wise person, it is understood that the actions prescribed by the scriptures are intended for the ignorant (aviduṣaḥ); thus, the conclusion of the Lord is understood."*

- **Explanation**: Since actions are impossible for the wise person who knows the Self, it follows that scriptural injunctions for actions are meant for those who are ignorant of the Self.

---

## **V. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. The Special Reason for Denying Action**

- **Question Raised**: What specific reason does the Lord see for declaring that the wise person cannot perform actions?
- **Understanding the Self**: The unchanging nature of the Self is the general reason, but Śaṅkara seeks a special reason related to the wise person.

### **2. Objection and Refutation**

- **Objection**: The unchanging nature of the Self has already been stated as the reason for the impossibility of action.
- **Refutation**: While the Self is unchanging, the knower (viduṣaḥ) might be considered different from the Self. However, Śaṅkara asserts that the knower is the Self, not the body-mind complex.

### **3. The Knower as the Self**

- **Not the Body-Mind Complex**: The aggregate of body and mind is not the true knower.
- **Self as Knower**: By eliminating the body-mind complex, the Self remains as the unchanging knower.

### **4. Impossibility of Action for the Wise**

- **Actionlessness of the Self**: Since the Self is unchanging and actionless, the wise person who identifies with the Self cannot be the doer of actions.
- **Appropriateness of Denial**: Thus, the Lord's statement "How can that person..." appropriately denies the possibility of action for the wise.

### **5. Perception through Ignorance and Knowledge**

- **Ignorance (Avidyā)**: In ignorance, the Self appears to engage in perception due to non-discrimination between the intellect's modifications and the Self.
- **Knowledge (Vidyā)**: In knowledge, the Self is called the 'knower' only figuratively, as it remains unchanging in reality.

### **6. Scriptural Injunctions Intended for the Ignorant**

- **Actions Prescribed**: Since actions are impossible for the wise, the scriptural prescriptions of actions are meant for the ignorant.
- **Lord's Conclusion**: The understanding is that the Lord intends for those who are ignorant to engage in prescribed actions as a means toward knowledge.

---

## **VI. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Non-Doership of the Self**

- **Actionless Self**: The Self is unchanging and does not engage in actions.
- **Wise Person's Identification**: The wise person identifies with the Self and thus recognizes non-doership.

### **2. Ignorance and Knowledge**

- **Role of Ignorance**: Ignorance leads to the misperception that the Self is the doer and experiencer.
- **Role of Knowledge**: Knowledge dispels ignorance, revealing the Self's true nature as unchanging and actionless.

### **3. Scriptural Prescriptions**

- **Purpose of Actions**: Actions prescribed by the scriptures serve as a means for the ignorant to purify the mind and attain knowledge.
- **Not for the Wise**: The wise, having realized the Self, are beyond the need for prescribed actions.

### **4. Figurative Use of 'Knower'**

- **Metaphorical Language**: The term 'knower' is used figuratively for the Self, acknowledging that in ultimate reality, the Self is beyond such designations.
- **Tool of Instruction**: This figurative language aids in teaching and guiding seekers toward realization.

---

## **VII. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Self-Inquiry and Discrimination**

- **Viveka (Discrimination)**: Practice discerning between the Self and not-Self to overcome ignorance.
- **Self-Inquiry**: Engage in deep contemplation to realize the Self as distinct from the body-mind complex.

### **2. Recognizing Non-Doership**

- **Letting Go of Ego**: Release the identification with being the doer of actions.
- **Witness Consciousness**: Adopt the stance of the witness, observing actions without attachment.

### **3. Understanding Scriptural Guidance**

- **Purpose of Prescribed Actions**: Recognize that actions prescribed by scriptures aim to purify the mind and are steps toward knowledge.
- **Personal Application**: If one has not yet realized the Self, engage in prescribed actions mindfully to progress spiritually.

### **4. Overcoming Ignorance**

- **Addressing Avidyā**: Acknowledge and work to remove ignorance through study, reflection, and meditation.
- **Embracing Knowledge**: Cultivate knowledge that leads to the realization of the Self's true nature.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** addresses why the **Lord** declares the impossibility of action for the **wise person** in the Bhagavad Gītā. He explains that since the wise person identifies with the **unchanging, actionless Self**, it is appropriate to deny the possibility of action for them. The body-mind complex is not the true knower; the Self is. Actions occur due to ignorance when the Self is misconstrued as engaging with the world through the mind's modifications.

However, for the wise who have discriminated between the Self and not-Self, the Self remains unchanging and actionless. Therefore, the **scriptural injunctions for actions are intended for the ignorant**, serving as a means to purify the mind and eventually realize the Self. This teaching emphasizes the importance of self-inquiry, recognizing non-doership, and understanding the ultimate goal of scriptural guidance.

---

## **IX. Next Steps**

### **1. Deepen Understanding**

- **Study Advaita Vedānta**: Explore texts and commentaries that delve into non-dualism and the nature of the Self.
- **Reflect on Non-Doership**: Contemplate how the concept of non-doership applies to daily life and spiritual practice.

### **2. Engage in Self-Inquiry**

- **Meditation Practices**: Incorporate meditation techniques that focus on observing thoughts and actions without attachment.
- **Journaling**: Write reflections on the distinction between the Self and the body-mind complex.

### **3. Apply Scriptural Teachings**

- **Mindful Actions**: Perform duties with awareness and as an offering, understanding their role in spiritual growth.
- **Seek Guidance**: Consult with knowledgeable teachers or join study groups to discuss and internalize these concepts.

### **4. Cultivate Knowledge**

- **Overcome Ignorance**: Engage in practices that help dispel ignorance, such as reading scriptures, satsang (spiritual discourse), and satsanga (company of the wise).
- **Embrace Wisdom**: Strive to embody the wisdom of the teachings in thought, word, and deed.

## **II. Contextual Introduction**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** continues his commentary on the **Bhagavad Gītā**, addressing the distinction between the **wise (vidvān)** and the **ignorant (avidvān)** regarding the prescription of actions (*karma*) and knowledge (*vidyā*). He responds to an objection about whether actions and knowledge are prescribed for the ignorant alone or also for the wise. Śaṅkara elaborates on why actions are appropriate for the ignorant, who identify themselves as doers, and why the wise, who realize the non-doership and unity of the Self, are eligible only for the renunciation of all actions.

---

## **III. Translation and Analysis of the Bhāṣya**

### **1. Raising the Objection**

**ननु विद्यापि अविदुष एव विधीयते, विदितविद्यस्य पिष्टपेषणवत् विद्याविधानानर्थक्यात् ।**

*"But even knowledge (vidyā) is prescribed only for the ignorant (aviduṣaḥ); prescribing knowledge for one who already knows is as pointless as grinding already ground flour."*

- **Explanation**: An objection is raised that just as actions are prescribed for the ignorant, so is knowledge. Prescribing knowledge to one who already possesses it is futile.

### **2. Questioning the Distinction**

**तत्र अविदुषः कर्माणि विधीयन्ते न विदुषः इति विशेषो न उपपद्यते इति चेत्**

*"Therefore, the distinction that actions are prescribed for the ignorant and not for the wise does not hold."*

- **Explanation**: The objector argues that if knowledge is also prescribed for the ignorant, there is no valid reason to distinguish that actions are meant for the ignorant and not for the wise.

### **3. Śaṅkara's Response**

**न; अनुष्ठेयस्य भाव-अभाव-विशेष-उपपत्तेः ।**

*"No; because the difference arises due to the presence or absence of something to be performed."*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara refutes the objection by pointing out that there is a valid distinction based on whether there is something to be performed or not.

### **4. Actions for the Ignorant**

**अग्निहोत्रादि-विधि-अर्थ-ज्ञानोत्तरकालम् अग्निहोत्रादि-कर्म अनेकसाधन-उपसंहार-पूर्वकम् अनुष्ठेयम् ‘कर्ता अहम्, मम कर्तव्यम्’ इति एवं-प्रकार-विज्ञान-वतः अविदुषः यथा अनुष्ठेयं भवति**

*"After the knowledge of the injunction of actions like Agnihotra, the action of Agnihotra and others, which require the collection of various means, is to be performed by the ignorant person who has the cognition 'I am the doer; this is my duty'—in that way, it is to be performed."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **अग्निहोत्रादि (agnihotrādi)**: Rituals like Agnihotra.
  - **अनुष्ठेयम् (anuṣṭheyam)**: To be performed.
  - **अविदुषः (aviduṣaḥ)**: Of the ignorant person.
  - **कर्ता अहम् (kartā aham)**: 'I am the doer'.
  - **मम कर्तव्यम् (mama kartavyam)**: 'My duty'.

- **Explanation**: The ignorant person, believing themselves to be the doer, undertakes prescribed actions like rituals, gathering necessary means and performing them as duties.

### **5. No Actions for the Wise Post-Knowledge**

**न तु तथा ‘न जायते’ इत्यादि आत्म-स्वरूप-विधि-अर्थ-ज्ञानोत्तर-काल-भावि किञ्चित् अनुष्ठेयं भवति;**

*"But after the knowledge of the nature of the Self as taught in 'He is not born' etc., there is nothing to be performed."*

- **Explanation**: For the wise person who has realized the true nature of the Self, as described in teachings like 'He is not born', there is no action that needs to be performed thereafter.

### **6. Result of Self-Knowledge**

**किं तु ‘न अहं कर्ता, न अहं भोक्ता’ इत्यादि आत्म-एकत्व-अकर्तृत्व-आदि-विषय-ज्ञानात् न अन्यद् उत्पद्यते इति एष विशेष उपपद्यते ।**

*"Rather, from the knowledge of the unity of the Self and concepts like 'I am not the doer, I am not the enjoyer', nothing else arises—this distinction is appropriate."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **न अहं कर्ता (na ahaṁ kartā)**: 'I am not the doer'.
  - **न अहं भोक्ता (na ahaṁ bhoktā)**: 'I am not the enjoyer'.
  - **आत्म-एकत्व (ātma-ekatva)**: Unity of the Self.
  - **अकर्तृत्व (akartṛtva)**: Non-doership.

- **Explanation**: The wise person, realizing the Self's non-doership and unity, finds that no further actions arise or are necessary.

### **7. Actions Arise for the Ignorant**

**यः पुनः ‘कर्ता अहम्’ इति वेत्ति आत्मानम्, तस्य ‘मम इदं कर्तव्यम्’ इति अवश्यंभाविनी बुद्धिः स्यात्;**

*"On the other hand, he who considers himself 'I am the doer' will necessarily have the thought 'This is my duty'."*

- **Explanation**: The ignorant person, identifying as the doer, inevitably feels compelled to perform duties.

### **8. Eligibility for Actions**

**तद् अपेक्षया सः अधिक्रियते इति तं प्रति कर्माणि सम्भवन्ति ।**

*"With that in view, he becomes eligible, and actions are possible for him."*

- **Explanation**: Based on his identification as the doer, the ignorant person becomes eligible for actions prescribed by the scriptures.

### **9. Identification of the Ignorant**

**स च अविद्वान्, ‘उभौ तौ न विजानीतः’ (भ. गी. २ । १९) इति वचनात्, विशेषितस्य च विदुषः कर्माक्षेप-वचनाच्च ‘कथं स पुरुषः’ इति ।**

*"And he is ignorant, according to the statement 'Both of them do not know' (Bh. Gī. 2.19), and due to the statement denying action for the specified wise person, 'How can that person...'"*

- **Explanation**: The Bhagavad Gītā identifies those who think they kill or are killed as ignorant. Conversely, it denies action for the wise person who knows the Self.

### **10. Conclusion: Renunciation for the Wise**

**तस्मात् विशेषितस्य अविक्रिय-आत्म-दर्शिनः विदुषः मुमुक्षोः च सर्व-कर्म-संन्यासे एव अधिकारः ।**

*"Therefore, the wise person who sees the unchanging Self and the seeker of liberation are eligible only for the renunciation of all actions."*

- **Key Terms**:
  - **अविक्रिय-आत्म-दर्शिन् (avikriya-ātma-darśin)**: One who sees the unchanging Self.
  - **विदुषः (viduṣaḥ)**: Of the wise person.
  - **मुमुक्षोः (mumukṣoḥ)**: Of the seeker of liberation.
  - **सर्व-कर्म-संन्यासे (sarva-karma-saṁnyāse)**: Renunciation of all actions.
  - **अधिकारः (adhikāraḥ)**: Eligibility or entitlement.

- **Explanation**: The wise person and the sincere seeker are entitled to renounce all actions, as they realize the Self's true nature.

### **11. Scriptural Support for Two Paths**

**अत एव भगवान् नारायणः साङ्ख्यान् विदुषः अविदुषः च कर्मिणः प्रविभज्य द्वे निष्ठे ग्राहयति — ‘ज्ञान-योगेन साङ्ख्यानां कर्म-योगेन योगिनाम्’ (भ. गी. ३ । ३) इति ।**

*"Therefore, Lord Nārāyaṇa, dividing the Sāṅkhyas (the wise) and the Yogins (the active), establishes two paths: 'By the yoga of knowledge for the Sāṅkhyas, and by the yoga of action for the Yogins' (Bh. Gī. 3.3)."*

- **Explanation**: The Bhagavad Gītā distinguishes between the path of knowledge for those who are wise and the path of action for those who are active and still identify with being the doer.

### **12. Further Scriptural Reference**

**तथा च पुत्राय आह भगवान् व्यासः — ‘द्वाविमावथ पन्थानौ’ (शां. २४१ । ६) इत्यादि ।**

*"And so, the Blessed Lord Vyāsa says to his son: 'There are indeed these two paths' (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva 241.6) etc."*

- **Explanation**: Vyāsa, a revered sage, also mentions the existence of two paths, reinforcing the distinction between knowledge and action.

### **13. Sequence of Paths**

**तथा च क्रिया-पथः च एव पुरस्तात् पश्चात् संन्यासः च इति ।**

*"And thus, there is the path of action first, and afterwards renunciation."*

- **Explanation**: One typically engages in actions first to purify the mind, followed by renunciation upon attaining knowledge.

### **14. Lord's Reiteration of the Division**

**एतमेव विभागं पुनः पुनः दर्शयिष्यति भगवान् — अ-तत्त्व-वित् ‘अहङ्कार-विमूढ-आत्मा कर्ता अहम् इति मन्यते’ (भ. गी. ३ । २७), तत्त्व-वित् तु न अहं करोमि इति ।**

*"The Lord will show this division again and again: 'The one who is deluded by ego thinks 'I am the doer'' (Bh. Gī. 3.27), but the knower of truth knows 'I do nothing'."*

- **Explanation**: The Bhagavad Gītā repeatedly emphasizes the distinction between the ignorant who identify as doers and the wise who recognize the Self as non-doer.

### **15. Renunciation for the Wise**

**तथा च ‘सर्व-कर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्य आस्ते’ (भ. गी. ५ । १३) इत्यादि ॥**

*"And so, 'Renouncing all actions mentally, he remains' (Bh. Gī. 5.13) etc."*

- **Explanation**: The scriptures advocate that the wise person mentally renounces all actions, recognizing the Self's true nature.

## **V. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Objection Regarding Prescription of Knowledge**

- **Objection**: Knowledge (vidyā) is prescribed only for the ignorant; prescribing it for the wise is pointless.
- **Implication**: There is no valid distinction in prescribing actions only for the ignorant.

### **2. Śaṅkara's Refutation**

- **Presence of Something to Perform**: The distinction arises because the ignorant have actions to perform, while the wise do not.
- **Actions for the Ignorant**: The ignorant, identifying as doers, are compelled to perform prescribed duties.
- **No Actions for the Wise**: The wise, realizing non-doership, have no actions to perform after attaining knowledge.

### **3. Eligibility Based on Self-Identification**

- **Ignorant's Identification**: 'I am the doer'; leads to the feeling of obligation to perform duties.
- **Wise Person's Realization**: 'I am not the doer, not the enjoyer'; no further actions arise.
- **Eligibility for Actions**: Only the ignorant are eligible for prescribed actions.

### **4. Scriptural Support for Two Paths**

- **Bhagavad Gītā's Division**: The scripture distinguishes between the path of knowledge for the wise and the path of action for the ignorant.
- **Repeated Emphasis**: The Gītā reiterates this division, highlighting the appropriate path based on one's level of understanding.

### **5. Conclusion**

- **Renunciation for the Wise**: The wise and seekers of liberation are entitled to renounce all actions.
- **Actions for the Ignorant**: Prescribed actions serve as a means for the ignorant to purify the mind and eventually attain knowledge.

---

## **VI. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Non-Doership of the Self**

- **Self is Actionless**: The true Self does not engage in actions.
- **Ignorance Leads to Doership**: Identification with the ego creates the illusion of being the doer.

### **2. Paths to Liberation**

- **Path of Action (Karma Yoga)**: Suitable for those who identify as doers; purifies the mind.
- **Path of Knowledge (Jñāna Yoga)**: For those who have realized non-doership; leads directly to liberation.

### **3. Role of Scriptures**

- **Guidance Based on Readiness**: Scriptures prescribe different paths based on the seeker's level of understanding.
- **Purpose of Actions**: Actions are tools for the ignorant to progress toward knowledge.

### **4. Renunciation**

- **Internal Renunciation**: The wise renounce actions mentally, knowing the Self is unaffected by activities.
- **External Actions May Continue**: Even if actions are performed externally, the wise remain unattached.

---

## **VII. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Self-Inquiry**

- **Question Doership**: Reflect on who is the true doer; investigate the nature of the Self.
- **Meditation on Non-Doership**: Meditate on the teachings 'I am not the doer' to internalize this realization.

### **2. Appropriate Practice Based on Understanding**

- **Engage in Actions Mindfully**: If identifying as the doer, perform prescribed duties with dedication.
- **Seek Knowledge**: Pursue spiritual study and contemplation to progress toward realization.

### **3. Renunciation**

- **Mental Renunciation**: Practice detachment from actions and outcomes, even while performing duties.
- **Prepare for Renunciation**: Recognize that renunciation is appropriate when one attains Self-knowledge.

### **4. Understanding Scriptural Guidance**

- **Study Scriptures**: Read texts like the Bhagavad Gītā to understand the appropriate path.
- **Apply Teachings**: Integrate scriptural wisdom into daily life based on one's level of realization.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** addresses an objection regarding the prescription of knowledge and actions for the ignorant and the wise. He clarifies that while knowledge is indeed prescribed for the ignorant to attain realization, once knowledge is gained, no further actions are necessary for the wise. The ignorant, identifying themselves as doers, are compelled to perform prescribed duties. The wise, realizing non-doership and the unity of the Self, are eligible only for the renunciation of all actions.

Śaṅkara supports his argument by citing scriptural references that distinguish between the paths appropriate for the ignorant and the wise. The **Bhagavad Gītā** emphasizes this division, advocating the path of action for those who have not yet realized the Self and the path of knowledge and renunciation for those who have.

---

## **IX. Next Steps**

### **1. Reflect on Personal Identification**

- **Assess Self-View**: Contemplate whether you identify as the doer or recognize the Self's non-doership.
- **Adjust Practice Accordingly**: Engage in actions or focus on knowledge and renunciation based on your understanding.

### **2. Study the Bhagavad Gītā**

- **Deepen Understanding**: Read and reflect on chapters that discuss the paths of action and knowledge.
- **Explore Commentaries**: Study Śaṅkarācārya's commentaries for deeper insights.

### **3. Practice Mindfulness in Action**

- **Perform Duties with Awareness**: Engage in daily activities consciously, observing attachments and desires.
- **Cultivate Detachment**: Work towards performing actions without attachment to outcomes.

### **4. Seek Guidance**

- **Consult Teachers**: Discuss these concepts with knowledgeable guides to clarify understanding.
- **Join Study Groups**: Participate in discussions with fellow seekers to share insights and support each other.

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** continues his commentary on **Bhagavad Gītā 2.21** and addresses objections regarding the **renunciation of all actions** (*sarva-karma-sannyāsa*) for a person who has attained **Self-knowledge** (*ātma-jñāna*). The discussion revolves around whether the renunciation applies only to mental actions or also to verbal and physical actions. Śaṅkara refutes the arguments that limit renunciation and reasserts that in the context of the Gītā, the renunciation of all actions is prescribed for the enlightened individual, not for one who is still engaged in actions.

## **III. Translation and Analysis of the Bhāṣya**

### **1. Objection Regarding Renunciation**

**ननु मनसा इति वचनात् न वाचिकानां कायिकानां च संन्यासः इति चेत्, न; सर्वकर्माणि इति विशेषितत्वात् ।**

*"But if it is argued that because of the phrase 'by mind' (manasā), the renunciation does not apply to verbal (vācika) and physical (kāyika) actions—this is not so; because the specification 'all actions' (sarva-karmaṇi) has been made."*

- **Explanation**: An objector claims that since the text mentions renunciation 'by mind,' it implies that only mental actions are to be renounced, not verbal or physical actions. Śaṅkara counters this by pointing out that the scripture specifies 'all actions,' indicating that renunciation is comprehensive.

### **2. Refuting the Limitation to Mental Actions**

**मानसानाम् एव सर्वकर्मणाम् इति चेत्, न; मनोव्यापारपूर्वकत्वात् वाक्कायव्यापाराणां मनोव्यापाराभावे तदनुपपत्तेः ।**

*"If it is suggested that 'all actions' refers only to mental actions, we say no; because verbal and physical activities are preceded by mental activity, and without mental activity, they cannot occur."*

- **Explanation**: The objector might argue that 'all actions' refers only to mental actions. Śaṅkara refutes this by explaining that verbal and physical actions cannot take place without prior mental activity; thus, renouncing mental actions implicitly includes renouncing verbal and physical actions.

### **3. Excluding Scriptural Actions**

**शास्त्रीयाणां वाक्कायकर्मणां कारणानि मानसानि कर्माणि वर्जयित्वा अन्यानि सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्येत् इति चेत्, न; ‘नैव कुर्वन्न कारयन्’ (भ. गी. ५ । १३) इति विशेषणात् ।**

*"If it is proposed that one should mentally renounce all actions except the mental actions that are the causes of scriptural verbal and physical actions, we say no; because of the specification 'neither acting nor causing others to act' (Bhagavad Gītā 5.13)."*

- **Explanation**: The objector suggests excluding mental actions that lead to scripturally ordained verbal and physical actions from renunciation. Śaṅkara rejects this, citing the Gītā's clear statement that the enlightened one neither acts nor causes others to act, emphasizing total renunciation.

### **4. Renunciation Only at Death?**

**सर्वकर्मसंन्यासः अयं भगवता उक्तः मरिष्यतः न जीवतः इति चेत्, न; ‘नवद्वारे पुरे देही आस्ते’ (भ. गी. ५ । १३) इति विशेषणानुपपत्तेः ।**

*"If it is argued that this renunciation of all actions is taught by the Blessed Lord for one who is about to die, not for the living—this is not acceptable; because the specification 'the embodied one resides in the city of nine gates' (Bhagavad Gītā 5.13) would not be appropriate."*

- **Explanation**: The objector claims that total renunciation is meant only for someone at the point of death. Śaṅkara refutes this by pointing out that the Gītā describes the renunciant as residing in the body ('city of nine gates'), which would not make sense if the person were deceased.

### **5. Incompatibility with Death**

**न हि सर्वकर्मसंन्यासेन मृतस्य तद्देहे आसनं सम्भवति ।**

*"Indeed, it is not possible for a dead person who has renounced all actions to reside in that body."*

- **Explanation**: A dead person cannot 'reside' in the body; thus, the renunciation described must pertain to a living person.

### **6. Alternative Interpretation Rejected**

**अकुर्वतः अकारयतः च देहे संन्यस्य इति सम्बन्धः न देहे आस्ते इति चेत्, न; सर्वत्र आत्मनः अविक्रियत्वावधारणात्, आसनक्रियायाश् च अधिकरणापेक्षत्वात्, तदनपेक्षत्वाच् च संन्यासस्य ।**

*"If it is suggested that the connection is 'having renounced actions, he neither acts nor causes others to act in the body,' not 'he resides in the body'—this is not acceptable; because everywhere, the immutability of the Self is ascertained, and the act of residing requires a locus, whereas renunciation does not depend on such a locus."*

- **Explanation**: The objector tries to reinterpret the text to avoid the issue. Śaṅkara counters by emphasizing that the Self is always immutable and that 'residing' implies an action requiring a physical basis, which contradicts the nature of renunciation that does not depend on any physical locus.

### **7. Meaning of 'Sannyāsa'**

**सम्पूर्वस् तु न्यासशब्दः अत्र त्यागार्थः, न निक्षेपार्थः ।**

*"Here, the term 'nyāsa' prefixed by 'sam' (in 'sannyāsa') means 'renunciation,' not 'deposit' or 'placement'."*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara clarifies that 'sannyāsa' signifies total renunciation, not the physical act of placing or depositing something somewhere.

### **8. Conclusion on Eligibility for Renunciation**

**तस्मात् गीताशास्त्रे आत्मज्ञानवतः संन्यासे एव अधिकारः, न कर्मणि इति तत्र तत्र उपरिष्टात् आत्मज्ञानप्रकरणे दर्शयिष्यामः ॥ २१ ॥**

*"Therefore, in the scripture of the Gītā, one who has attained Self-knowledge is eligible only for renunciation, not for action; this will be shown here and there in the subsequent discussions on Self-knowledge."*

- **Explanation**: Śaṅkara concludes that according to the Gītā, those who have realized the Self are entitled to renounce all actions. He indicates that this point will be further elaborated in later sections dealing with Self-knowledge.

## **V. Dialectical Analysis**

### **1. Scope of Renunciation**

- **Objection**: Renunciation applies only to mental actions, not verbal or physical ones.
- **Śaṅkara's Response**: The term 'all actions' clearly includes mental, verbal, and physical actions. Since verbal and physical actions stem from mental activities, renouncing mental actions inherently includes the others.

### **2. Exclusion of Scriptural Actions**

- **Objection**: One should renounce all actions mentally except those leading to scripturally prescribed actions.
- **Śaṅkara's Response**: The Gītā specifies that the enlightened neither act nor cause others to act, leaving no room for exceptions.

### **3. Timing of Renunciation**

- **Objection**: Total renunciation is intended only for those about to die.
- **Śaṅkara's Response**: The text mentions the renunciant as residing in the body, which would be impossible if the person were dead.

### **4. Nature of the Self and Renunciation**

- **Objection**: Perhaps 'residing in the body' is not meant literally.
- **Śaṅkara's Response**: Since the Self is immutable, any act of residing implies dependence on a physical locus, which contradicts the nature of the Self and renunciation.

### **5. Meaning of 'Sannyāsa'**

- **Clarification**: 'Sannyāsa' means renunciation (tyāga), not the physical act of placing or depositing (nikṣepa). This emphasizes the internal, mental aspect of renunciation.

### **6. Eligibility for Renunciation**

- **Conclusion**: The enlightened individual, possessing Self-knowledge, is eligible only for the renunciation of all actions, not for engaging in actions. This is consistent throughout the Gītā's teachings.

---

## **VI. Philosophical Implications**

### **1. Total Renunciation for the Enlightened**

- **Non-Partial Renunciation**: Renunciation is not limited to certain types of actions; it encompasses all actions—mental, verbal, and physical—for the enlightened.

### **2. The Role of Mental Activity**

- **Root of Actions**: Mental activity is the precursor to verbal and physical actions. Renouncing mental actions effectively halts all subsequent actions.

### **3. Immutability of the Self**

- **Self as Non-Doer**: The Self is unchanging and does not engage in actions. Recognizing this, the enlightened naturally renounce actions.

### **4. Living Renunciation**

- **Renunciation in Life**: Renunciation is to be practiced while living, not just at the point of death. The enlightened person lives in the world without attachment or engagement in actions.

### **5. Scriptural Consistency**

- **Gītā's Teaching**: The Bhagavad Gītā consistently advocates for the renunciation of all actions by those who have realized the Self.

---

## **VII. Application to Spiritual Practice**

### **1. Understanding Renunciation**

- **Comprehensive Renunciation**: Practitioners should aim for the renunciation of all actions, recognizing that mental renunciation includes verbal and physical actions.

### **2. Purification of the Mind**

- **Mental Discipline**: Cultivate mental purity and control, as the mind is the source of all actions.

### **3. Recognizing the Self's Nature**

- **Self-Knowledge**: Strive to realize the immutable, actionless nature of the Self, which leads to natural renunciation.

### **4. Living as a Renunciant**

- **Detachment in Life**: Practice detachment and non-action while living, embodying the principles of renunciation in daily life.

### **5. Consistency with Scriptures**

- **Scriptural Study**: Engage deeply with texts like the Bhagavad Gītā to understand the teachings on renunciation and Self-knowledge.

## **VIII. Summary**

In this passage, **Śaṅkarācārya** addresses objections regarding the extent and timing of renunciation for the enlightened individual. He refutes the idea that renunciation applies only to mental actions or only at the point of death. By emphasizing the term 'all actions' and citing scriptural passages, he establishes that total renunciation—including mental, verbal, and physical actions—is prescribed for those who have attained Self-knowledge. The Self, being immutable and actionless, does not engage in actions, and recognizing this truth leads the enlightened to renounce all actions while living. This teaching aligns with the consistent message of the **Bhagavad Gītā** that the path of renunciation is appropriate for the wise, not the path of action.
