# Trans-Idealist Analysis Framework: Bhagavad Gītā 2.22-30

## I. Core Philosophical Structure

### A. Consciousness Progression
1. Mixed States (Vyāmiśra)
   - Vitarka-vicāra: Dyadic plane of subject-object
   - Vicāra-vitarka: Reverse dyadic plane
   - Progressive purification through negation

2. Pure States (Kevala)
   - Prajñā: Non-mixed consciousness
   - Beyond subject-object structure
   - Self-evident nature (svataḥsiddha)

### B. Dialectical Movement
1. First Level: Immediate Awareness
   - Body-consciousness structure
   - Subject-object division
   - Action-reaction framework

2. Second Level: Reflection
   - Recognition of change
   - Need for stable ground
   - Questioning of immediate structures

3. Third Level: Resolution
   - Pure presence realized
   - Beyond subject-object
   - Original synthetic unity

## II. Technical Term Analysis

### A. Key Sanskrit Terms
1. देहिन् (dehin)
   - Not mere "embodied one"
   - Pure synthetic unity
   - Through all forms

2. अविनाशिन् (avināśin)
   - Not mere "indestructible"
   - Self-maintaining presence
   - Original stability

3. अप्रमेय (aprameya)
   - Not mere "immeasurable"
   - Self-evident nature
   - Beyond proof structure

### B. Philosophical Implications
1. Nature of Change
   - Not mere temporal sequence
   - Pure activity maintaining itself
   - Through all modifications

2. True Stability
   - Not endless duration
   - Self-evident presence
   - Original synthetic unity

## III. Trans-Idealist Correlations

### A. Fichtean Framework
1. Tathandlung (Pure Act)
   - Self-positing I
   - Through all determinations
   - Original synthetic unity

2. Intellectual Intuition
   - Direct self-knowing
   - Beyond subject-object
   - Pure presence

### B. Hegelian Connections
1. Dialectical Movement
   - Through contradictions
   - To deeper unity
   - Pure self-relation

2. Absolute Knowledge
   - Beyond representation
   - Pure presence
   - Original synthesis

## IV. Practical Implementation

### A. Recognition Structure
1. Direct Vision
   - Beyond proof
   - Self-evident nature
   - Pure comprehension

2. Through Changes
   - Not affected
   - Pure presence
   - Original stability

### B. Action Framework
1. Pure Activity
   - Not mere doing
   - Self-maintaining presence
   - Original synthesis

2. Through Forms
   - Not affected by changes
   - Pure stability
   - Original unity

## V. Methodological Principles

### A. Analysis Requirements
1. Track consciousness progression
   - From mixed to unmixed states
   - Through negation
   - To pure presence

2. Map philosophical correlations
   - Sanskrit-German bridges
   - Conceptual equivalences
   - Technical term clusters

### B. Documentation Standards

### B. Philosophical Goals
1. Clear progression
   - From mixed to pure states
   - Through systematic negation
   - To original synthesis

2. Practical applicability
   - Clear implementation path
   - Systematic development
   - Verifiable results

## VII. Chapter-Specific Focus

### A. BG 2.22-30 Structure
1. Progressive Negation
   - Of body identification
   - Of action framework
   - To pure presence

2. Resolution Pattern
   - Through contradiction
   - To deeper unity
