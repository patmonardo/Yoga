# Technical Analysis of Bhagavad Gītā 2.11

## Sanskrit Text and Structure

### Base Verse
```sanskrit
श्रीभगवानुवाच —
अशोच्यानन्वशोचस्त्वं प्रज्ञावादांश्च भाषसे ।
गतासूनगतासूंश्च नानुशोचन्ति पण्डिताः ॥ ११ ॥
```

### Key Terms Analysis
1. अशोच्यान् (aśocyān) - "those not to be grieved for"
   - Negative compound: a + śocya
   - Root: √śuc (to grieve)
   - Philosophical significance: Points to transcendental status

2. प्रज्ञावादान् (prajñāvādān) - "statements of wisdom"
   - Compound: prajñā + vāda
   - Technical meaning: Theoretical knowledge claims
   - Contrasted with actual prajñā (wisdom)

3. पण्डिताः (paṇḍitāḥ) - "the wise"
   - Etymology from paṇḍā (wisdom of Self)
   - Śaṅkara: "Those whose buddhi concerns the Self"
   - Reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka: "Going beyond learning"

## Commentary Structure

### Opening Analysis
Śaṅkara immediately focuses on the term aśocya:
```sanskrit
अशोच्याः भीष्मद्रोणादयः, सद्वृत्तत्वात् परमार्थस्वरूपेण च नित्यत्वात्
```

Two key reasons given:
1. सद्वृत्तत्वात् - Due to their virtuous conduct
2. परमार्थस्वरूपेण नित्यत्वात् - Due to their eternal nature in ultimate reality

### Critique of Arjuna's Position
1. False identification:
   - "They die because of me"
   - "What will I do without them"

2. Contradiction exposed:
   - Between claimed wisdom (prajñāvāda)
   - And actual confusion (mauḍhya)

### Definition of True Knowledge
1. पण्डिताः defined as आत्मज्ञाः (knowers of Self)
2. Reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad:
   - "Going beyond mere learning"
   - Points to direct knowledge

## Technical Framework

### Epistemological Levels
1. Theoretical Knowledge (prajñāvāda)
   - Mere statements about wisdom
   - Still in dyadic consciousness

2. Direct Knowledge (ātmajñāna)
   - Beyond grief
   - Non-dual realization

### Ontological Analysis
1. Empirical Level
   - Birth and death appear
   - Relationships seem real

2. Transcendental Level (paramārtha)
   - Eternal nature revealed
   - Beyond temporal changes

### Resolution Through Prajñā
1. False Prajñā
   - Mere theoretical statements
   - Still in subject-object duality

2. True Prajñā
   - Direct non-dual knowledge
   - Transcendence of grief

## Connection to Akṣara Doctrine
1. Introduction of Eternal Nature
   - Through term nitya
   - Points to later akṣara discussion

2. Levels of Reality
   - Temporal appearances
   - Eternal foundation

3. Progressive Revelation
   - From apparent knowledge
   - To direct realization
