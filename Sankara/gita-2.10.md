# Śaṅkara's Bhagavad Gītā Chapter 2 Bhāṣya - Opening Sections

## Initial Context Setting

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
atra 'dṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkam' (bha. gī. 1.2)
ityārabhya yāvat 'na yotsya iti govindamuktvā tūṣṇīṃ babhūva ha' (bha. gī. 2.9)
ityetadantaḥ prāṇināṃ śokamohādisaṃsārabījabhūtadoṣodbhavakāraṇapradarśanārthatvena vyākhyeyo granthaḥ |
```

### Translation
The text from "Having seen the Pāṇḍava army" (1.2) up to "Having told Govinda 'I will not fight,' he fell silent" (2.9) is to be interpreted as demonstrating the cause of the arising of defects that are the seeds of saṃsāra, such as grief and delusion, in living beings.

### Technical Analysis
- Key terms:
  - śoka-moha: grief and delusion as fundamental causes
  - saṃsāra-bīja: seeds of cyclic existence
  - doṣodbhava: arising of defects
  - pradarśana: demonstration/showing forth

## Explanation of Arjuna's State

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tathāhi — arjunena rājyaguruputramitrasuhr̥tsvajanasambandhibāndhaveṣu 'ahametesām' 'mamaite' ityevaṃpratyayanimittasnehavicchedādinimittau ātmanaḥ śokamohau pradarśitau 'kathaṃ bhīṣmamahaṃ saṅkhye' (bha. gī. 2.4) ityādinā |

śokamohābhyāṃ hyabhibhūtaviveakavijñānaḥ svata eva kṣatradharme yuddhe pravr̥tto'pi tasmādyuddhāduparāma; paradharmam ca bhikṣājīvanādikaṃ kartuṃ pravr̥te |
```

### Translation
Thus indeed - Arjuna displayed his own grief and delusion, caused by the severance of attachment based on the notions of "I am theirs" and "they are mine" towards kings, teachers, sons, friends, well-wishers, relatives and kinsmen, saying "How can I fight against Bhīṣma?" (2.4) and so forth.

Overwhelmed by grief and delusion, his discriminative understanding overcome, though naturally engaged in the warrior's duty of battle, he withdrew from that battle and turned to another's duty such as living by begging.

### Technical Analysis
- Key philosophical concepts:
  - aham-mama: I/mine identification
  - viveka-vijñāna: discriminative understanding
  - svadharma vs paradharma: own duty vs another's duty
- Progression of delusion:
  1. False identification
  2. Loss of discrimination
  3. Abandonment of svadharma
  4. Attraction to paradharma

## Universal Application

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tathā ca sarvaprāṇināṃ śokamohādidoṣāviṣṭacetasāṃ svabhāvata eva svadharmaparityāgaḥ pratiṣiddhasevā ca syāt |
svadharme pravr̥ttānāmapi teṣāṃ vāṅmanaḥkāyādīnāṃ pravr̥ttiḥ phalābhisandhipūrvikāiva sāhaṅkārā ca bhavati |
```

### Translation
And thus for all beings whose minds are possessed by defects like grief and delusion, there naturally occurs abandonment of their own duty and engagement in prohibited actions. Even when engaged in their own duty, their activity of speech, mind, and body is preceded by desire for results and accompanied by ego.

### Technical Analysis
- Universal pattern identified:
  1. doṣāviṣṭa-cetas: mind possessed by defects
  2. svadharma-parityāga: abandonment of own duty
  3. pratiṣiddha-sevā: engagement in prohibited acts
- Even in svadharma:
  - phalābhisandhi: desire for results
  - sāhaṅkāra: presence of ego

## Nature of Saṃsāra

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tatraivaṃ sati dharmādharmopacayāt iṣṭāniṣṭajanmasukhduḥkhādipāptilakṣaṇaḥ saṃsāraḥ anuparato bhavati |
```

### Translation
In this situation, due to the accumulation of dharma and adharma, saṃsāra - characterized by attainment of desired and undesired births, pleasures and pains, etc. - continues without cessation.

### Technical Analysis
- Causal chain of saṃsāra:
  1. dharma-adharma accumulation
  2. iṣṭa-aniṣṭa results
  3. janma-sukha-duḥkha cycle
- Key characteristic: anupara (non-cessation)

## Solution Through Knowledge

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
ityataḥ saṃsārabījabhūtau śokamohau tayośca sarvakārmasaṃnyāsapūrvakādātmajñānāt nānyato nivr̥ttiriti tadupadiśikṣuḥ sarvālokānugrahārtham arjunaṃ nimittīkr̥tya āha bhagavānvāsudevaḥ — 'aśocyān' (bha. gī. 2.11) ityādi ||
```

### Translation
Therefore, grief and delusion are the seeds of saṃsāra, and their cessation comes only from self-knowledge preceded by complete renunciation of all actions, not from anything else. Wishing to teach this, for the benefit of all people, using Arjuna as the occasion, Lord Vāsudeva began speaking with "Those who should not be grieved for" (2.11).

### Technical Analysis
- Solution structure:
  1. sarvakārmasaṃnyāsa: complete renunciation
  2. ātmajñāna: self-knowledge
- Universal application:
  - sarvālokānugraha: benefit for all
  - Arjuna as nimitta (instrumental cause)

---

## Key Philosophical Points

1. Root cause of saṃsāra:
   - śoka (grief) and moha (delusion)
   - Based on false identification ("I am theirs"/"they are mine")

2. Process of entanglement:
   - Loss of viveka-vijñāna (discriminative understanding)
   - Abandonment of svadharma (one's own duty)
   - Action with phalābhisandhi (desire for results) and ahaṅkāra (ego)

3. Solution:
   - sarvakārmasaṃnyāsa (complete renunciation of all actions)
   - Followed by ātmajñāna (self-knowledge)

4. Universal applicability:
   - Pattern applies to all beings
   - Teaching intended for universal benefit
   - Arjuna as representative case

# Opposition to Pure Knowledge Path

## Opposing View Introduced

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
atra kecidāhuḥ — sarvakārmasaṃnyāsapūrvakādātmajñānaniṣṭhāmātrādeva kevalāt kaivalyaṃ na prāpyata eva |
kiṃ tarhi? agnihotrādiśrautasmārtakārmasahitāt jñānāt kaivalyaprāptiriti sarvāsu gītāsu niścito'rtha iti |
```

### Translation
Here some say: "Liberation (kaivalya) cannot be attained from mere steadfastness in self-knowledge preceded by complete renunciation of all actions alone. What then? Liberation comes from knowledge combined with Vedic and traditional actions like the Agnihotra - this is the established meaning in all the Gītā."

### Technical Analysis
- Key opposing concepts:
  - kevala jñāna (pure knowledge) vs karma-sahita jñāna (knowledge with action)
  - Two types of karma mentioned:
    - śrauta: Vedic rituals
    - smārta: traditional duties
- Critical term: kaivalya (liberation)
  - Note the wordplay between kevala (alone) and kaivalya (liberation)

## Evidence Cited by Opponents

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
jñāpakaṃ ca āhurasya'rthasya — 'atha cet tvamimam dharmyaṃ saṅgrāmaṃ na kariṣyasi' (bha. gī. 2.33) 'karmaṇyevādhikāraste' (bha. gī. 2.47) 'kuru karmaiva tasmāttvam' (bha. gī. 4.15) ityādi |
```

### Translation
And they cite as evidence for this meaning: "If you will not fight this righteous battle" (2.33), "Your right is to action alone" (2.47), "Therefore you must perform action" (4.15), and so forth.

### Technical Analysis
- Opponents' textual evidence:
  - Uses dharmic battle as example
  - Emphasizes adhikāra (qualification/right) to action
  - Stresses imperative for action

## Defense of Vedic Action

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
hiṃsādiyuktatvāt vaidikaṃ karma adharmāya itīyamapyāśaṅkā na kāryā | katham? kṣātraṃ karma yuddhalakṣaṇaṃ gurubhrātr̥putrādihiṃsālakṣaṇamatyantaṃ krūramapi svadharma iti kr̥tvā na adharmāya;
```

### Translation
The doubt that Vedic action leads to adharma because it involves violence should not be entertained. Why? Because even extremely cruel warrior's duty characterized by battle and involving harm to teachers, brothers, sons, etc., being one's own dharma, does not lead to adharma.

### Technical Analysis
- Addresses potential objection:
  - Violence in Vedic ritual
  - Compared to violence in warfare
- Key principle: svadharma transcends ordinary moral categories

## Further Scriptural Evidence

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tadakaraṇe ca 'tataḥ svadharmaṃ kīrtiṃ ca hitvā pāpamavāpsyasi' (bha. gī. 2.33) iti bruvatā yāvajjīvādiśruticoditānāṃ paśvādihiṃsālakṣaṇānāṃ ca karmaṇāṃ prāgeva nādhārmatvamiti suniścitamuktaṃ bhavati — iti ||
```

### Translation
And by saying "Then, abandoning your own dharma and fame, you will incur sin" (2.33), it is firmly established that actions involving violence to animals etc., enjoined by śruti as lifelong duties, are definitely not adharma.

### Technical Analysis
- Complex argument structure:
  - Uses battlefield dharma to justify ritual violence
  - Appeals to śruti authority
  - Links svadharma to cosmic order

## Śaṅkara's Initial Refutation

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tadasat; jñānakarma-niṣṭhayorvibhāgavacanādbuddhidvayāśrayayoḥ |
```

### Translation
This is incorrect, because of the statements distinguishing between steadfastness in knowledge and action, which are based on two different types of understanding.

### Technical Analysis
- Pivotal rebuttal:
  - Introduces buddhidvaya (two types of understanding)
  - Establishes fundamental incompatibility
  - Points to distinct epistemological bases

## Two Types of Understanding Explained

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
'aśocyān' (bha. gī. 2.11) ityādinā bhagavatā yāvat 'svadharmamapi cāvekṣya' (bha. gī. 2.31) ityetadantena granthena yat paramārthātmatattvānirūpaṇaṃ kr̥tam, tat sāṅkhyam |

tadviṣayā buddhiḥ ātmano janmādiṣaḍvikārābhāvādakarttā ātmeti prakaraṇārthānirūpaṇāt yā jāyate, sā sāṅkhyā buddhiḥ |
```

### Translation
What has been set forth by the Lord from "Those who should not be grieved for" (2.11) up to "And considering your own dharma" (2.31) as the determination of the ultimate truth of the Self - that is Sāṅkhya.

The understanding that arises from this exposition of the topic - that the Self is non-doer due to absence of the six modifications beginning with birth - that is Sāṅkhya understanding.

### Technical Analysis
- Sāṅkhya understanding defined:
  - Based on paramārtha (ultimate truth)
  - Focuses on ātman's nature
  - Recognizes absence of vikāras (modifications)
  - Establishes akartṛtva (non-doership)

---

## Key Philosophical Points

1. The Opposition's Position:
   - Necessity of combining knowledge and action
   - Appeal to scriptural authority
   - Defense of ritual violence

2. Śaṅkara's Response:
   - Fundamental distinction of paths
   - Different epistemological bases
   - Incompatibility of knowledge and action

3. Critical Distinctions:
   - kevala vs sahita approaches
   - Different types of buddhi
   - Levels of dharmic understanding

4. Technical Framework:
   - Role of svadharma
   - Nature of knowledge
   - Basis of liberation

# Analysis of Arjuna's Question

## Question's Logical Basis

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
na ca arjunasya praśna upapanno bhavati 'jyāyasī cetkarmaṇaste' (bha. gī. 3.1) ityādiḥ | ekapuruṣānuṣṭheyatvāsambhavaṃ buddhikarmaṇoḥ bhagavatā pūrvamanukataṃ kathamarjunaḥ aśrutaṃ buddheśca karmaṇo jyāyastvaṃ bhagavatyadhyāropayenmr̥ṣaiva 'jyāyasī cetkarmaṇaste matā buddhiḥ' (bha. gī. 3.1) iti ||
```

### Translation
And Arjuna's question "If you think knowledge is better than action" (3.1) would not make sense. Since the Lord had previously stated the impossibility of one person practicing both knowledge and action, how could Arjuna falsely attribute to the Lord the superiority of knowledge over action without having heard it, saying "If you think knowledge is better than action" (3.1)?

### Technical Analysis
- Key logical elements:
  - ekapuruṣānuṣṭheyatva: possibility of practice by one person
  - buddhikarmaṇoḥ: of knowledge and action
  - jyāyastva: superiority/better-ness
- Structure of argument:
  - Uses reductio ad absurdum
  - Appeals to textual consistency
  - Questions possibility of false attribution

## Further Analysis of Combined Practice

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
kiñca — yadi buddhikarmaṇoḥ sarveṣāṃ samuccaya uktaḥ syāt arjunasyāpi sa ukta evaiti, 'yacchraya etayorekaṃ tanme brūhi suniścitam' (bha. gī. 5.1) iti kathamubhayorupadeśe sati anyataraviṣaya eva praśnaḥ syāt?
```

### Translation
Moreover - if combination of knowledge and action had been taught as applicable to all, including Arjuna, then when both were taught, how could his question be about only one of them, saying "Tell me decisively which one of these is better" (5.1)?

### Technical Analysis
- Key concept: samuccaya (combination)
  - Applied universally (sarveṣām)
  - Includes Arjuna specifically
- Logical impossibility:
  - Both taught (ubhayorupadeśa)
  - Question about one (anyatara)
  - Contradiction exposed

## Medical Analogy

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
na hi pittapraśamanārthinaḥ vaidyena madhuraṃ śītalaṃ ca bhoktavyam ityupadiṣṭe tayoranyataratpittapraśamanakāraṇaṃ brūhi iti praśnaḥ sambhavati ||
```

### Translation
Indeed, when a doctor prescribes both sweet and cool things to someone seeking to cure pitta, it's not possible for them to ask "Tell me which one of these cures pitta."

### Technical Analysis
- Analogy structure:
  - Medical context (vaidya)
  - Two remedies (madhura and śītala)
  - Single purpose (pittapraśamana)
- Logical application:
  - If both necessary, choosing impossible
  - If combination intended, question meaningless
  - Shows absurdity of opponent's position

## Question of Misunderstanding

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
atha arjunasya bhagavaduktavacanārthaviveakānavadhāraṇanimittaḥ praśnaḥ kalpyeta, tathāpi bhagavatā praśnānurūpaṃ prativacanaṃ deyam — mayā buddhikarmaṇoḥ samuccaya uktaḥ, kimarthamitthaṃ tvaṃ bhrānto'si — iti |
```

### Translation
If one were to suppose that Arjuna's question arose from lack of discriminative understanding of the meaning of the Lord's words, even then the Lord should have given an appropriate response - "I taught the combination of knowledge and action, why are you confused like this?"

### Technical Analysis
- Hypothetical counter:
  - Assumes misunderstanding (aviveaka)
  - Suggests proper response
  - Shows actual response different
- Key terms:
  - vacanārtha: meaning of words
  - anavadhāraṇa: lack of determination
  - praśnānurūpa: appropriate to question

## Lord's Actual Response

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
na tu punaḥ prativacanamananurūpaṃ pr̥ṣṭādanyadeva 'dve niṣṭhe mayā purā prokte' (bha. gī. 3.3) iti vaktuṃ yuktam ||
```

### Translation
But it would not be appropriate to give an irrelevant response different from what was asked, saying "I previously taught two paths" (3.3).

### Technical Analysis
- Final argument:
  - Actual response confirms two paths
  - Shows irrelevance of combination theory
  - Validates distinct paths interpretation

---

## Key Philosophical Points

1. Logical Structure of Argument:
   - Uses Arjuna's questions as evidence
   - Shows impossibility of combination theory
   - Demonstrates through reductio ad absurdum

2. Important Technical Terms:
   - samuccaya (combination)
   - buddhikarmaṇoḥ (of knowledge and action)
   - vivekānavadhāraṇa (lack of discriminative understanding)
   - ekapuruṣānuṣṭheyatva (possibility of practice by one person)

3. The Medical Analogy:
   - Shows absurdity of asking which path is better if both are meant to be combined
   - Demonstrates Śaṅkara's practical reasoning approach

4. Textual Analysis:
   - Uses cross-references from multiple chapters
   - Shows internal consistency of two-path interpretation
   - Demonstrates careful attention to question-answer structure

# The Distinctness of Paths and Transcendence

## On Ritual Action

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
nāpi smārtenāiva karmaṇā buddheḥ samuccaye abhiprete vibhāgavacanādi sarvamupapannam | kiñca — kṣatriyasya yuddhaṃ smārtaṃ karma svadharma iti jānataḥ 'tatkiṃ karmaṇi ghore māṃ niyojayasi' (bha. gī. 3.1) iti upālambho'nupapannaḥ ||
```

### Translation
Not even if combination of knowledge with traditional ritual action were intended would all these statements about distinction make sense. Moreover - for one who knows that battle is a warrior's traditional duty and own-dharma, the reproach "Why do you enjoin me to this terrible action?" (3.1) would not make sense.

### Technical Analysis
- Levels of consciousness:
  - Vitarka-Vicara: domain of ritual action (smārta karma)
  - Leads to Sabija Samadhi (with seed/support)
- Key distinction:
  - Knowledge here not yet Prajna-level
  - Still operating in dyadic plane

## Definitive Statement on Knowledge Path

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tasmādgītāśāstre īṣanmātreṇāpi śrautena smārtena vā karmaṇā ātmajñānasya samuccayo na kenaciddarśayituṃ śakyaḥ |
```

### Translation
Therefore in the teaching of the Gītā, no one can demonstrate even the slightest combination of self-knowledge with either Vedic or traditional action.

### Technical Analysis
- Points to Nirbija Samadhi:
  - Pure knowledge (ātmajñāna)
  - Beyond all supports (nirbija)
  - Prajna-Dharma-Jnana level
- Impossibility of combination:
  - Different planes of consciousness
  - Different epistemological bases

## Progress Through Purification

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
yasya tu ajñānāt rāgādidoṣato vā karmaṇi pravr̥ttasya yajñena dānena tapasā vā viśuddhasattvasya jñānamutpannamparamārthatattvāviṣayam 'ekamevedaṃ sarvaṃ brahma akartr̥ ca' iti, tasya karmaṇi karmaprayojane ca nivr̥tte'pi lokasaṅgrahārthaṃ yatnapūrvaṃ yathā pravr̥ttiḥ, tathaiva pravr̥ttasya yatpravr̥ttirūpaṃ dr̥śyate na tatkarma yena buddheḥ samuccayaḥ syāt |
```

### Translation
However, for one who, engaged in action due to ignorance or defects like attachment, attains purity of being through sacrifice, charity, or austerity, and in whom arises the knowledge of ultimate reality that "All this is indeed one Brahman, which is non-doer" - even though action and its purpose have ceased for him, his continuing activity for the welfare of the world is not the kind of action that could be combined with knowledge.

### Technical Analysis
- Progressive stages:
  1. Vitarka-Vicara: initial ritual action
  2. Movement to Sabija Samadhi through purification
  3. Breakthrough to Prajna-Dharma-Jnana
  4. Nirbija state of pure knowledge
- Post-realization activity:
  - Not karma in ordinary sense
  - Spontaneous flow from Prajna level
  - Beyond dyadic consciousness

## Example of Krishna's Actions

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
yathā bhagavato vāsudevasya kṣatradharma-ceṣṭitaṃ na jñānena samuccīyate puruṣārthasiddhaye, tadvat tatphalābhisandhyahaṅkārābhāvasya tulyatvādviduṣaḥ | tattvavinnāhaṃ karomīti manyate, na ca tatphalamabhisandhatte |
```

### Translation
Just as Lord Vāsudeva's performance of warrior-duty is not combined with knowledge for achieving human ends, similarly for the knower, due to the similar absence of ego and desire for results. The knower of reality does not think "I act" nor does he seek its results.

### Technical Analysis
- Example of Nirbija state:
  - Beyond doership (ahaṅkāra)
  - Beyond result-seeking (phalābhisandhi)
  - Pure Prajna-level functioning
- Krishna as exemplar:
  - Natural activity without seed
  - Beyond Vitarka-Vicara plane
  - Pure knowledge-based action

## Ritual Performance Analogy

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
yathā ca svargādikāmārthinaḥ agnihotrādikarmālakṣaṇadharmānuṣṭhānāya āhitāgneḥ kāmye eva agnihotrādau pravr̥ttasya sāmi kr̥te vinaṣṭe'pi kāme tadeva agnihotrādyanuttiṣṭhato'pi na tatkāmyamagnihotrādi bhavati |
```

### Translation
Just as when one who maintains the sacred fire for performing the Agnihotra and other rites desiring heaven continues to perform these same rites even after the desire has been destroyed, these are no longer desire-based rites.

### Technical Analysis
- Transformation of consciousness:
  - From Sabija (desire-based) to Nirbija (desireless)
  - Same external form, different consciousness level
  - Movement from Vitarka-Vicara to Prajna

## Lord's Teaching on Non-attachment

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tathā ca darśayati bhagavān — 'kurvannapi na lipyate' (bha. gī. 5.7) 'na karoti na lipyate' (bha. gī. 13.31) iti tatra tatra ||
```

### Translation
And thus the Lord shows in various places - "Though acting, he is not bound" (5.7), "He neither acts nor is bound" (13.31).

### Technical Analysis
- Description of Nirbija state:
  - Beyond binding action
  - Pure Prajna functioning
  - Transcendence of Vitarka-Vicara duality

---

## Key Philosophical Points

1. Two Distinct Paths:
   - Sabija: With support/seed
     * Operates in Vitarka-Vicara plane
     * Includes ritual and traditional action
     * Progressive purification
   - Nirbija: Without support/seed
     * Pure Prajna-Dharma-Jnana
     * Beyond doership and results
     * Natural, spontaneous functioning

2. Impossibility of Combination:
   - Different planes of consciousness
   - Different epistemological bases
   - Different modes of operation

3. Transformation Process:
   - From bound to unbound action
   - From Vitarka-Vicara to Prajna
   - From Sabija to Nirbija state

4. Nature of Liberation:
   - Beyond all supports
   - Pure knowledge state
   - Transcendence of action-knowledge duality

# On Examples of Ancient Kings and Sages

## The Case of Ancient Examples

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
yacca 'pūrvaiḥ pūrvataraṃ kr̥tam' (bha. gī. 4.15) 'karmaṇaiva hi saṃsiddhimāsthitā janakādayaḥ' (bha. gī. 3.20) iti, tattu pravibhajya vijñeyam |
```

### Translation
As for the statements "Done previously by the ancients" (4.15) and "Indeed through action alone Janaka and others attained perfection" (3.20), these must be understood with proper discrimination.

### Technical Analysis
- Key term: pravibhajya (with discrimination)
  - Points to need for deeper understanding
  - Beyond surface appearance
  - Distinction of consciousness levels

## Two Possible Interpretations

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tatkartham? yadi tāvat pūrve janakādayaḥ tattvavido'pi pravr̥ttakarmāṇaḥ syuḥ, te lokasaṅgrahārtham 'guṇā guṇeṣu vartante' (bha. gī. 3.28) iti jñānenaiva saṃsiddhimāsthitāḥ, karmasaṃnyāse prāpte'pi karmaṇā sahaiva saṃsiddhimāsthitāḥ, na karmasaṃnyāsaṃ kr̥tavanta ityarthaḥ |
```

### Translation
How so? If the ancients like Janaka, though knowers of reality, engaged in action, they attained perfection through knowledge alone, for the welfare of the world, understanding that "qualities act on qualities" (3.28). Though qualified for renunciation of action, they remained with action - meaning they did not undertake formal renunciation.

### Technical Analysis
- Two levels of understanding:
  - Nirbija state (tattvavida): true knowers
  - Operation in apparent Vitarka-Vicara plane
- Key insight: guṇā guṇeṣu vartante
  - Recognition of pure consciousness
  - Beyond doership
  - Prajna-level understanding

## Alternative Interpretation

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
atha na te tattvāvidaḥ; īśvarasamarpitena karmaṇā sādhanabhūtena saṃsiddhiṃ sattvaśuddhim, jñānotpattilakṣaṇāṃ vā saṃsiddhim, āsthitā janakādaya iti vyākhyeyam |
```

### Translation
Or if they were not knowers of reality, then it should be explained that Janaka and others attained perfection - either as purity of being or as the arising of knowledge - through action offered to the Lord as a means.

### Technical Analysis
- Sabija progression:
  - Action as means (sādhanabhūta)
  - Leading to purity (sattvaśuddhi)
  - Arising of knowledge (jñānotpatti)
- Different than Nirbija state:
  - Still in means-end framework
  - Within Vitarka-Vicara plane

## Support from Later Verses

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
evamevārthaṃ vakṣyati bhagavān 'sattvaśuddhaye karma kurvanti' (bha. gī. 5.11) iti | 'svakarmaṇā tamabhyarcya siddhiṃ vindati mānavaḥ' (bha. gī. 18.46) ityuktvā siddhiṃ prāptasya punarjñānaniṣṭhāṃ vakṣyati — 'siddhiṃ prāpto yathā brahma' (bha. gī. 18.50) ityādinā ||
```

### Translation
The Lord will state this very meaning: "They perform action for the purification of being" (5.11). After saying "By worshipping Him through one's own action, man attains perfection" (18.46), He will speak of the establishment in knowledge for one who has attained perfection - "One who has attained perfection, as Brahman" (18.50).

### Technical Analysis
- Progressive stages delineated:
  1. Purificatory action (Vitarka-Vicara)
  2. Attainment of perfection (Sabija Samadhi)
  3. Establishment in knowledge (Nirbija/Prajna)

## Definitive Conclusion

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tasmādgītāśāstre kevalādeva tattvajñānānmokṣaprāptiḥ na karmasamuccitāt, iti niścito'rthaḥ | yathā cāyamarthaḥ, tathā prakaraṇaśo vibhajya tatra tatra darśayiṣyāmaḥ ||
```

### Translation
Therefore in the teaching of the Gītā, liberation comes from knowledge of reality alone, not from its combination with action - this is the definitive meaning. And how this is so, we shall show by analysis in each context.

### Technical Analysis
- Final establishment:
  - Pure knowledge path (kevala)
  - Nirbija state as goal
  - Prajna-Dharma-Jnana as means

## Return to Arjuna's Condition

### Sanskrit Text
```sanskrit
tatraivaṃ dharmasaṃmūḍhacetaso mithyājñānavato mahati śokasāgare nimagnasya arjunasya anyatrātmajñānāduddhāraṇamapaśyan bhagavānvāsudevaḥ tataḥ kr̥payā arjunamuddidhārayiṣuḥ ātmajñānāyāvatārayannāha —
```

### Translation
Thus seeing no rescue other than self-knowledge for Arjuna, whose mind was confused about dharma, possessed of false knowledge, and immersed in a great ocean of sorrow, Lord Vāsudeva, desiring out of compassion to lift him up, began speaking to lead him to self-knowledge.

### Technical Analysis
- Initial state diagnosis:
  - Confusion in Vitarka-Vicara plane
  - Need for transcendence to Prajna
  - Path to Nirbija state indicated

---

## Key Philosophical Points

1. Two Ways of Understanding Ancient Examples:
   - As Nirbija states appearing in world
   - As progression through Sabija stages

2. Nature of True Action:
   - In Nirbija: spontaneous, non-binding
   - In Sabija: purificatory, progressive

3. Progression of Consciousness:
   - From Vitarka-Vicara confusion
   - Through Sabija purification
   - To Nirbija realization

4. Ultimate Teaching:
   - Kevala jñāna as pure Prajna state
   - Beyond all supports and means
   - True nature of liberation
