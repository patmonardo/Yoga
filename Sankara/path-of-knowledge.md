# Opening Section Translation

## Initial Context Setting
*atra 'dṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkam' (bha. gī. 1.2) ityārabhya yāvat 'na yotsya iti govindamuktvā tūṣṇīṃ babhūva ha' (bha. gī. 2.9) ityetadantaḥ prāṇināṃ śokamohādisaṃsārabījabhūtadoṣodbhavakāraṇapradarśanārthatvena vyākhyeyo granthaḥ |*

The text from "Having seen the Pāṇḍava army" (1.2) up to "Having told Govinda 'I will not fight,' he fell silent" (2.9) is to be interpreted as demonstrating the cause of the arising of defects that are the seeds of saṃsāra, such as grief and delusion, in living beings.

## Explanation of Arjuna's State
*tathāhi — arjunena rājyaguruputramitrasuhr̥tsvajanasambandhibāndhaveṣu 'ahametesām' 'mamaite' ityevaṃpratyayanimittasnehavicchedādinimittau ātmanaḥ śokamohau pradarśitau 'kathaṃ bhīṣmamahaṃ saṅkhye' (bha. gī. 2.4) ityādinā |*

Thus indeed - Arjuna displayed his own grief and delusion, caused by the severance of attachment based on the notions of "I am theirs" and "they are mine" towards kings, teachers, sons, friends, well-wishers, relatives and kinsmen, saying "How can I fight against Bhīṣma?" (2.4) and so forth.

*śokamohābhyāṃ hyabhibhūtaviveakavijñānaḥ svata eva kṣatradharme yuddhe pravr̥tto'pi tasmādyuddhāduparāma; paradharmam ca bhikṣājīvanādikaṃ kartuṃ pravr̥te |*

Overwhelmed by grief and delusion, his discriminative understanding overcome, though naturally engaged in the warrior's duty of battle, he withdrew from that battle and turned to another's duty such as living by begging.

## Universal Application
*tathā ca sarvaprāṇināṃ śokamohādidoṣāviṣṭacetasāṃ svabhāvata eva svadharmaparityāgaḥ pratiṣiddhasevā ca syāt | svadharme pravr̥ttānāmapi teṣāṃ vāṅmanaḥkāyādīnāṃ pravr̥ttiḥ phalābhisandhipūrvikāiva sāhaṅkārā ca bhavati |*

And thus for all beings whose minds are possessed by defects like grief and delusion, there naturally occurs abandonment of their own duty and engagement in prohibited actions. Even when engaged in their own duty, their activity of speech, mind, and body is preceded by desire for results and accompanied by ego.

## Nature of Saṃsāra
*tatraivaṃ sati dharmādharmopacayāt iṣṭāniṣṭajanmasukhduḥkhādipāptilakṣaṇaḥ saṃsāraḥ anuparato bhavati |*

In this situation, due to the accumulation of dharma and adharma, saṃsāra - characterized by attainment of desired and undesired births, pleasures and pains, etc. - continues without cessation.

## Solution Through Knowledge
*ityataḥ saṃsārabījabhūtau śokamohau tayośca sarvakārmasaṃnyāsapūrvakādātmajñānāt nānyato nivr̥ttiriti tadupadiśikṣuḥ sarvālokānugrahārtham arjunaṃ nimittīkr̥tya āha bhagavānvāsudevaḥ — 'aśocyān' (bha. gī. 2.11) ityādi ||*

Therefore, grief and delusion are the seeds of saṃsāra, and their cessation comes only from self-knowledge preceded by complete renunciation of all actions, not from anything else. Wishing to teach this, for the benefit of all people, using Arjuna as the occasion, Lord Vāsudeva began speaking with "Those who should not be grieved for" (2.11).

Key philosophical points in this translation:

1. Root cause of saṃsāra:
   - śoka (grief) and moha (delusion)
   - Based on false identification ("I am theirs"/"they are mine")

2. Process of entanglement:
   - Loss of viveka-vijñāna (discriminative understanding)
   - Abandonment of svadharma (one's own duty)
   - Action with phalābhisandhi (desire for results) and ahaṅkāra (ego)

3. Solution:
   - sarvakārmasaṃnyāsa (complete renunciation of all actions)
   - Followed by ātmajñāna (self-knowledge)

# Opposition to Pure Knowledge Path

## Opposing View Introduced
*atra kecidāhuḥ — sarvakārmasaṃnyāsapūrvakādātmajñānaniṣṭhāmātrādeva kevalāt kaivalyaṃ na prāpyata eva | kiṃ tarhi? agnihotrādiśrautasmārtakārmasahitāt jñānāt kaivalyaprāptiriti sarvāsu gītāsu niścito'rtha iti |*

Here some say: "Liberation (kaivalya) cannot be attained from mere steadfastness in self-knowledge preceded by complete renunciation of all actions alone. What then? Liberation comes from knowledge combined with Vedic and traditional actions like the Agnihotra - this is the established meaning in all the Gītā."

## Evidence Cited by Opponents
*jñāpakaṃ ca āhurasya'rthasya — 'atha cet tvamimam dharmyaṃ saṅgrāmaṃ na kariṣyasi' (bha. gī. 2.33) 'karmaṇyevādhikāraste' (bha. gī. 2.47) 'kuru karmaiva tasmāttvam' (bha. gī. 4.15) ityādi |*

And they cite as evidence for this meaning: "If you will not fight this righteous battle" (2.33), "Your right is to action alone" (2.47), "Therefore you must perform action" (4.15), and so forth.

## Defense of Vedic Action
*hiṃsādiyuktatvāt vaidikaṃ karma adharmāya itīyamapyāśaṅkā na kāryā | katham? kṣātraṃ karma yuddhalakṣaṇaṃ gurubhrātr̥putrādihiṃsālakṣaṇamatyantaṃ krūramapi svadharma iti kr̥tvā na adharmāya;*

The doubt that Vedic action leads to adharma because it involves violence should not be entertained. Why? Because even extremely cruel warrior's duty characterized by battle and involving harm to teachers, brothers, sons, etc., being one's own dharma, does not lead to adharma.

*tadakaraṇe ca 'tataḥ svadharmaṃ kīrtiṃ ca hitvā pāpamavāpsyasi' (bha. gī. 2.33) iti bruvatā yāvajjīvādiśruticoditānāṃ paśvādihiṃsālakṣaṇānāṃ ca karmaṇāṃ prāgeva nādhārmatvamiti suniścitamuktaṃ bhavati — iti ||*

And by saying "Then, abandoning your own dharma and fame, you will incur sin" (2.33), it is firmly established that actions involving violence to animals etc., enjoined by śruti as lifelong duties, are definitely not adharma.

## Śaṅkara's Refutation
*tadasat; jñānakarma-niṣṭhayorvibhāgavacanādbuddhidvayāśrayayoḥ |*

This is incorrect, because of the statements distinguishing between steadfastness in knowledge and action, which are based on two different types of understanding.

## Two Types of Understanding Explained
*'aśocyān' (bha. gī. 2.11) ityādinā bhagavatā yāvat 'svadharmamapi cāvekṣya' (bha. gī. 2.31) ityetadantena granthena yat paramārthātmatattvānirūpaṇaṃ kr̥tam, tat sāṅkhyam |*

What has been set forth by the Lord from "Those who should not be grieved for" (2.11) up to "And considering your own dharma" (2.31) as the determination of the ultimate truth of the Self - that is Sāṅkhya.

*tadviṣayā buddhiḥ ātmano janmādiṣaḍvikārābhāvādakarttā ātmeti prakaraṇārthānirūpaṇāt yā jāyate, sā sāṅkhyā buddhiḥ |*

The understanding that arises from this exposition of the topic - that the Self is non-doer due to absence of the six modifications beginning with birth - that is Sāṅkhya understanding.

# Analysis of Arjuna's Question - Translation

## Question's Logical Basis
*na ca arjunasya praśna upapanno bhavati 'jyāyasī cetkarmaṇaste' (bha. gī. 3.1) ityādiḥ | ekapuruṣānuṣṭheyatvāsambhavaṃ buddhikarmaṇoḥ bhagavatā pūrvamanukataṃ kathamarjunaḥ aśrutaṃ buddheśca karmaṇo jyāyastvaṃ bhagavatyadhyāropayenmr̥ṣaiva 'jyāyasī cetkarmaṇaste matā buddhiḥ' (bha. gī. 3.1) iti ||*

And Arjuna's question "If you think knowledge is better than action" (3.1) would not make sense. Since the Lord had previously stated the impossibility of one person practicing both knowledge and action, how could Arjuna falsely attribute to the Lord the superiority of knowledge over action without having heard it, saying "If you think knowledge is better than action" (3.1)?

## Further Analysis of Combined Practice
*kiñca — yadi buddhikarmaṇoḥ sarveṣāṃ samuccaya uktaḥ syāt arjunasyāpi sa ukta evaiti, 'yacchraya etayorekaṃ tanme brūhi suniścitam' (bha. gī. 5.1) iti kathamubhayorupadeśe sati anyataraviṣaya eva praśnaḥ syāt?*

Moreover - if combination of knowledge and action had been taught as applicable to all, including Arjuna, then when both were taught, how could his question be about only one of them, saying "Tell me decisively which one of these is better" (5.1)?

## Medical Analogy
*na hi pittapraśamanārthinaḥ vaidyena madhuraṃ śītalaṃ ca bhoktavyam ityupadiṣṭe tayoranyataratpittapraśamanakāraṇaṃ brūhi iti praśnaḥ sambhavati ||*

Indeed, when a doctor prescribes both sweet and cool things to someone seeking to cure pitta, it's not possible for them to ask "Tell me which one of these cures pitta."

## Question of Misunderstanding
*atha arjunasya bhagavaduktavacanārthaviveakānavadhāraṇanimittaḥ praśnaḥ kalpyeta, tathāpi bhagavatā praśnānurūpaṃ prativacanaṃ deyam — mayā buddhikarmaṇoḥ samuccaya uktaḥ, kimarthamitthaṃ tvaṃ bhrānto'si — iti |*

If one were to suppose that Arjuna's question arose from lack of discriminative understanding of the meaning of the Lord's words, even then the Lord should have given an appropriate response - "I taught the combination of knowledge and action, why are you confused like this?"

## Lord's Actual Response
*na tu punaḥ prativacanamananurūpaṃ pr̥ṣṭādanyadeva 'dve niṣṭhe mayā purā prokte' (bha. gī. 3.3) iti vaktuṃ yuktam ||*

But it would not be appropriate to give an irrelevant response different from what was asked, saying "I previously taught two paths" (3.3).

Key philosophical points:

1. Logical Structure of Argument:
   - Uses Arjuna's questions as evidence
   - Shows impossibility of combination theory
   - Demonstrates through reductio ad absurdum

2. Important Technical Terms:
   - samuccaya (combination)
   - buddhikarmaṇoḥ (of knowledge and action)
   - vivekānavadhāraṇa (lack of discriminative understanding)
   - ekapuruṣānuṣṭheyatva (possibility of practice by one person)

3. The Medical Analogy:
   - Shows absurdity of asking which path is better if both are meant to be combined
   - Demonstrates Śaṅkara's practical reasoning approach

# The Distinctness of Paths and Transcendence

## On Ritual Action
*nāpi smārtenāiva karmaṇā buddheḥ samuccaye abhiprete vibhāgavacanādi sarvamupapannam | kiñca — kṣatriyasya yuddhaṃ smārtaṃ karma svadharma iti jānataḥ 'tatkiṃ karmaṇi ghore māṃ niyojayasi' (bha. gī. 3.1) iti upālambho'nupapannaḥ ||*

Not even if combination of knowledge with traditional ritual action were intended would all these statements about distinction make sense. Moreover - for one who knows that battle is a warrior's traditional duty and own-dharma, the reproach "Why do you enjoin me to this terrible action?" (3.1) would not make sense.

## Definitive Statement on Knowledge Path
*tasmādgītāśāstre īṣanmātreṇāpi śrautena smārtena vā karmaṇā ātmajñānasya samuccayo na kenaciddarśayituṃ śakyaḥ |*

Therefore in the teaching of the Gītā, no one can demonstrate even the slightest combination of self-knowledge with either Vedic or traditional action.

## Progress Through Purification
*yasya tu ajñānāt rāgādidoṣato vā karmaṇi pravr̥ttasya yajñena dānena tapasā vā viśuddhasattvasya jñānamutpannamparamārthatattvāviṣayam 'ekamevedaṃ sarvaṃ brahma akartr̥ ca' iti, tasya karmaṇi karmaprayojane ca nivr̥tte'pi lokasaṅgrahārthaṃ yatnapūrvaṃ yathā pravr̥ttiḥ, tathaiva pravr̥ttasya yatpravr̥ttirūpaṃ dr̥śyate na tatkarma yena buddheḥ samuccayaḥ syāt |*

However, for one who, engaged in action due to ignorance or defects like attachment, attains purity of being through sacrifice, charity, or austerity, and in whom arises the knowledge of ultimate reality that "All this is indeed one Brahman, which is non-doer" - even though action and its purpose have ceased for him, his continuing activity for the welfare of the world is not the kind of action that could be combined with knowledge.

## Example of Krishna's Actions
*yathā bhagavato vāsudevasya kṣatradharma-ceṣṭitaṃ na jñānena samuccīyate puruṣārthasiddhaye, tadvat tatphalābhisandhyahaṅkārābhāvasya tulyatvādviduṣaḥ | tattvavinnāhaṃ karomīti manyate, na ca tatphalamabhisandhatte |*

Just as Lord Vāsudeva's performance of warrior-duty is not combined with knowledge for achieving human ends, similarly for the knower, due to the similar absence of ego and desire for results. The knower of reality does not think "I act" nor does he seek its results.

# The Distinctness of Paths and Transcendence - Translation (Continued)

## Analogy of Ritual Performance
*yathā ca svargādikāmārthinaḥ agnihotrādikarmālakṣaṇadharmānuṣṭhānāya āhitāgneḥ kāmye eva agnihotrādau pravr̥ttasya sāmi kr̥te vinaṣṭe'pi kāme tadeva agnihotrādyanuttiṣṭhato'pi na tatkāmyamagnihotrādi bhavati |*

Just as when one who maintains the sacred fire for performing the Agnihotra and other rites desiring heaven continues to perform these same rites even after the desire has been destroyed, these are no longer desire-based rites.

## Lord's Teaching on Non-attachment
*tathā ca darśayati bhagavān — 'kurvannapi na lipyate' (bha. gī. 5.7) 'na karoti na lipyate' (bha. gī. 13.31) iti tatra tatra ||*

And thus the Lord shows in various places - "Though acting, he is not bound" (5.7), "He neither acts nor is bound" (13.31).

This translation highlights several points that support your insight:

1. The impossibility of simultaneous practice:
   - Like your point about deep contemplation vs. world-awareness
   - Śaṅkara shows this through logical argument

2. The transformation of action:
   - From sakāma to niṣkāma (with desire to desireless)
   - Similar to the vitarka-vicāra progression you mentioned

3. The state of the knower:
   - No ego-sense ("I act")
   - No desire for results
   - Similar to your understanding of pure jñāna

Your insight about Kriya-Jñāna as the Middle Way helps illuminate why Śaṅkara is so careful to distinguish between:
- Actions before knowledge
- Apparent actions after knowledge
- The impossibility of their true combination

Would you like to explore any of these aspects further or continue with the final translation?
# On Examples of Ancient Kings and Sages - Translation

## The Case of Ancient Examples
*yacca 'pūrvaiḥ pūrvataraṃ kr̥tam' (bha. gī. 4.15) 'karmaṇaiva hi saṃsiddhimāsthitā janakādayaḥ' (bha. gī. 3.20) iti, tattu pravibhajya vijñeyam |*

As for the statements "Done previously by the ancients" (4.15) and "Indeed through action alone Janaka and others attained perfection" (3.20), these must be understood with proper discrimination.

## Two Possible Interpretations
*tatkartham? yadi tāvat pūrve janakādayaḥ tattvavido'pi pravr̥ttakarmāṇaḥ syuḥ, te lokasaṅgrahārtham 'guṇā guṇeṣu vartante' (bha. gī. 3.28) iti jñānenaiva saṃsiddhimāsthitāḥ, karmasaṃnyāse prāpte'pi karmaṇā sahaiva saṃsiddhimāsthitāḥ, na karmasaṃnyāsaṃ kr̥tavanta ityarthaḥ |*

How so? If the ancients like Janaka, though knowers of reality, engaged in action, they attained perfection through knowledge alone, for the welfare of the world, understanding that "qualities act on qualities" (3.28). Though qualified for renunciation of action, they remained with action - meaning they did not undertake formal renunciation.

## Alternative Interpretation
*atha na te tattvāvidaḥ; īśvarasamarpitena karmaṇā sādhanabhūtena saṃsiddhiṃ sattvaśuddhim, jñānotpattilakṣaṇāṃ vā saṃsiddhim, āsthitā janakādaya iti vyākhyeyam |*

Or if they were not knowers of reality, then it should be explained that Janaka and others attained perfection - either as purity of being or as the arising of knowledge - through action offered to the Lord as a means.

## Support from Later Verses
*evamevārthaṃ vakṣyati bhagavān 'sattvaśuddhaye karma kurvanti' (bha. gī. 5.11) iti | 'svakarmaṇā tamabhyarcya siddhiṃ vindati mānavaḥ' (bha. gī. 18.46) ityuktvā siddhiṃ prāptasya punarjñānaniṣṭhāṃ vakṣyati — 'siddhiṃ prāpto yathā brahma' (bha. gī. 18.50) ityādinā ||*

The Lord will state this very meaning: "They perform action for the purification of being" (5.11). After saying "By worshipping Him through one's own action, man attains perfection" (18.46), He will speak of the establishment in knowledge for one who has attained perfection - "One who has attained perfection, as Brahman" (18.50).

## Definitive Conclusion
*tasmādgītāśāstre kevalādeva tattvajñānānmokṣaprāptiḥ na karmasamuccitāt, iti niścito'rthaḥ | yathā cāyamarthaḥ, tathā prakaraṇaśo vibhajya tatra tatra darśayiṣyāmaḥ ||*

Therefore in the teaching of the Gītā, liberation comes from knowledge of reality alone, not from its combination with action - this is the definitive meaning. And how this is so, we shall show by analysis in each context.

## Return to Arjuna's Condition
*tatraivaṃ dharmasaṃmūḍhacetaso mithyājñānavato mahati śokasāgare nimagnasya arjunasya anyatrātmajñānāduddhāraṇamapaśyan bhagavānvāsudevaḥ tataḥ kr̥payā arjunamuddidhārayiṣuḥ ātmajñānāyāvatārayannāha —*

Thus seeing no rescue other than self-knowledge for Arjuna, whose mind was confused about dharma, possessed of false knowledge, and immersed in a great ocean of sorrow, Lord Vāsudeva, desiring out of compassion to lift him up, began speaking to lead him to self-knowledge.
