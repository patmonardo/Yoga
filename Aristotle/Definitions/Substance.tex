Said to be SUBSTANCES are:

[1]     simple bodies

        Earth, Fire, Water, bodies in general and
        the things composed of them, both animals and divine beings,
        and the parts of these.  Each of these is said to be a substance
        because it is not said of an underlying subject but rather the
        other things are said of it.

[2]     component

        Any component that is the cause of a being in such things
        as are not said of an underlying subject. For example, 
        the soul in the case of an animal.

[3]     component parts

        Those component parts of such things that define them and
        signify a this something and whose destruction destroys the whole.

        The plane's does to the body, as some people say, and
        the line's does to the plane, and in general number seems to be 
        to some people. For they think that nothing is if number is done away,
        and it defines all things.

[4]     the essence

        The account of which is a definition is said to be each things's substance.

It follows then that something is said to be substance in two ways:
a. either it is the ultimate underlying subject that is 
no longer said of anything else or
b. that which, being a this something, is also separable --
and the shape and form of each thing is like this.
