What is said to be a LIMIT is:

[1]     the last point of each thing
    
        The first outside which it is not possible to find any part,
        or the first inside which every part is found.

[2]     the form of a spatial magnitude or of what has spatial magnitude

[3]     the end of each thing and for-the-sake-of which

        That toward which there is movement or action,
        not that from which, although sometimes it is both.

[4]     the substance of each thing and the essence of each
            
        For this is the limit of knowledge; and if of knowledge,
        then of its object too.

Things are said to be a limit in as many ways as they are said to be
a starting-point and yet more. For a starting-point is a sort of limit,
but not every limit is a starting-point.
