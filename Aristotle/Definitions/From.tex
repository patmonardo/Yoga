Something is said to be FROM something:

[1] if it is from its matter either with respect to 
    the first genus or ultimate species.

    in one way everything meltable is from water,
    but in another way a statue is from bronze.

[2] if it is from it as a first starting-point of having moved.

    what did the fight come from? abusive language.

[3] if it is from the composite of matter and shape.

    as parts are of the whole, and the verse of the Iliad.
    for the shape is an end and what possesses its end is complete.

[4] as the form from its parts.

    the human from the two-footed. for this is different from
    the way the statue is from bronze. for the composite substance
    is composed of perceptible matter, but the form is also composed
    of the matter of the form.

[5] if it belongs to it in one of these ways to be from a part. 

    the child is from its father and mother, and
    plants are from the earth, because they are a part of these things.

[6] if it comes after it in time.

    night comes from day, storms come from good weather,
    because one comes after the other.
    some are said to do so because they admit of change,
    others because they are merely successive in time.
    the voyage took place from the equinox because 
    it took place after the equinox.
    and the festival of the Thargelia comes from the Dionysia
    because after the Dionysia.
