Something is said to be a GENUS if:

[1]     the coming to be of things with the same form is continuous

        As long as the race of humans last means as long as
        the coming to be of humans is continuous.

[2]     it is the first mover that brought things into existence

[3]     it is as the plane is said to be of plane figures and solid of solids

[4]     it is as the first constituent in accounts is said to be

        The one said in the what-it-is, for this is the genus,
        whose differentia the qualities are said to be.

Things are said to be DISTINCT IN GENUS:

[1]     when the primary underlying subjects are distinct and
        when one is not analyzed into the other or 
        both into the same thing.

        The form and the matter are distinct in genus.

[2]     with reference to distinct figures of predication of being

        For some beings signify what it is, others a quality,
        others the various other things that were distinguished earlier.
        These too are neither analyzed into each other nor into some one thing.
