What is said to be a STATE:

[1]     activation of the state and state holder as action or movement

        For when one thing makes and another is made,
        there is a making between them. In the same way too,
        between the one who has clothes and the clothes he has
        there is a having. This sort of having we evidently
        cannot have. For it would go on without limit,
        if it were possible to have the having of what we have.

[2]     a disposition in virtue of which what is disposed is either
        well or ill disposed, and either intrinsically or
        with reference to something else

        Health is a state since it is a disposition of this sort.

[3]     anything that is part of such a disposition
        is said to be a state

        Which is why the virtue of a thing's parts is also a state.
