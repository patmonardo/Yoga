Things are said to be OPPOSITES are:

[1a]    contradictories
[1b]    contraries
[1c]    relatives
[1d]    lacking and having
[1e]    the extremes that coming-to-be and passing-away are
        from and to

[2]     things are said to be CONTRARIES are:
[2a]    things differing in genus that cannot belong to
        the same thing at the same time
[2b]    the most different of the things in the same genus
[2c]    the most different of the things in the same recipient
[2d]    the most different of the things falling under the same capacity
[2e]    the things whose difference is greatest either
        unconditionally or in genus or in species

But since things are said to be one and said to be in many ways,
the others that are said to be in accord with these must also follow along
with them, so that same, other, and contrary must be distinct in each category.

[3]     things said to be DISTINCT IN SPECIES are:
[3a]    things of the same genus but not subordinate to each other
[3b]    things of the same genus that have some difference
[3c]    things that have contrariety in their substance
[3d]    contraries either all of them or those said to be such in the primary way
[3e]    things whose accounts are distinct in the ultimate species of their genus
[3f]    things in the same substance that have a difference
