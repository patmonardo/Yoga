Something is said to be a COINCIDENT:

[1]     when it belongs to something and can be truly said of it
        but neither of necessity nor for the most part

        If someone digging a hole for a plant finds a treasure.
        For neither has one of necessity come from the other
        or after the other. If it does not happen by necessity
        or for the most part it is a coincidence.

[2]     when whatever belongs to each thing intrinsically
        but is not in its substance

        Having its interior angles equal to two right angles
        does not belong intrinsically to a triangle.
        Coincidents of this sort may be eternal whereas
        no coincidents of the other sort is.
