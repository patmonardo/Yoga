omething is said to be a QUALITY:

[1]     when it is a differentia of substance qualified in a certain way,
        on the grounds that a differentia that is with regard to substance is a quality

        Human is animal qualified in a certain way because two-footed.

[2]     when any constituent of a number beyond quantity that is in its substance
        for the substance of each is what it is once

        Such as immovable objects and the objects of mathematics,
        cases of numbers having certain qualities, composite numbers, planes and solids.

[3]     affections of moving substances in virtue of which bodies are said to alter

        Such as hotness and coldness, paleness and darkness, heaviness and lightness.

[4]     with reference to virtue and vice, and in general, to good and bad

For quality in the primary sense is the differentia of substance,
and of this the qualities in numbers are a part.
Second, there are the affections of things that move,
insofar as they move, and the differentia of the movement or activity.
Virtue and vice are a part of these affections,
in accord with which the things in movement act or are acted on nobly or basely.
Good and bad signify quality most of all in the case of animate things,
and above all in the case of those that have deliberative choice.
