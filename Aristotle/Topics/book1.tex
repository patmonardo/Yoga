The purpose of this treatise  is to discover a method by which we will be able
to syllogize about every proposed problem from probabilities.

The Dialectical Syllogism

A Contentious Syllogism

it appears to draw an inference but does not collect one

Paralogism

DIALECTIC is investigative and possesses the way to the principles of all methods

If a man omits no possibility, he sufficiently possesses science

Syllogisms are conversant with problems

PROPOSITION


PROBLEM

both show either genus, property, or accident

difference, being generic, must be placed among the genus

definition

a proposition becomes a problem by changing the mode

definitive and generic

THE SAME

in three ways

DISPUTATION

GENERA OF THE CATEGORIES

definition will always be in one of the CATEGORIES

THE DIALECTIC PROBLEM
