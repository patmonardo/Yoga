BOOK TWO

The Doctrine of Essence

ESSENCE

The truth of being is essence.

IV.1
jati-antara-parinama prakrti-apurat

In Hegel's "Science of Logic," the Doctrine of Essence is a significant part
of his larger philosophical system. It comes after the Doctrine of Being and
before the Doctrine of the Concept. The Doctrine of Essence deals with the
nature of reality and the underlying principles that govern the relationships
between things. It seeks to understand the deeper significance and essential
qualities that define objects and concepts.

Hegel's approach in the Doctrine of Essence is dialectical, meaning he
explores concepts through a process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. He
aims to reveal the contradictions and inherent limitations within concepts,
which ultimately lead to their transformation into higher and more
comprehensive concepts.

There are several key concepts within the Doctrine of Essence:

1. **Essence as Mediation:** Hegel introduces the concept of essence as a
mediation between being and concept. Essence is concerned with the inner
nature or true reality of things, going beyond their immediate appearances.

2. **Appearance and Reality:** Hegel delves into the relationship between
appearances and the underlying reality or essence. He argues that appearances
are not mere illusions but rather manifestations of essence, albeit in a
limited or distorted form. The essence represents the deeper, underlying
reality that gives meaning to appearances.

3. **Essential Properties:** Hegel explores how objects or concepts possess
essential properties that define them. These properties are what make
something what it truly is. He investigates how different properties relate to
one another and how they contribute to the overall essence of a thing.

4. **Contradiction and Negation:** Hegel's dialectical method involves
uncovering contradictions within concepts and showing how these contradictions
drive change and development. Through the process of negation, contradictions
lead to the synthesis of new concepts that encompass the contradictions and
move beyond them.

5. **Ground and Consequence:** Hegel introduces the concepts of "ground" and
"consequence" to describe the relationship between essence and its
manifestations. The ground is the underlying essence that gives rise to the
consequenceâ€”the external appearance or manifestation.

6. **Necessity:** Hegel explores the idea of necessity within essence.
Necessity refers to the inherent connection between a thing's essence and its
manifestations. Essence determines how a thing must necessarily appear.

Throughout the Doctrine of Essence, Hegel seeks to unveil the interplay
between appearance and reality, surface and depth, and how contradictions
within concepts give rise to higher and more comprehensive forms of
understanding. This process of development and transformation is central to
Hegel's larger philosophical project, which aims to comprehend the nature of
reality and thought in a systematic and interconnected manner.

CHAPTER 1

Shine

As it issues from being, essence seems to stand over against it;
this immediate being is, first, the unessential.

But, second, it is more than just the unessential;
it is being void of essence; it is shine.

Third, this shine is not something external,
something other than essence, but is essence's own shining.
This shining of essence within it is reflection.

A. THE ESSENTIAL AND THE UNESSENTIAL

Of course, I'd be happy to break down the argument in the provided excerpt
step by step:

Step 1: **Introduction to Essence and its Relationship with Being**
- The excerpt begins by stating that the truth of being is essence. Essence is
introduced as a concept that goes beyond immediate being to uncover a deeper
reality.
- Knowledge aims to understand what being truly is, not just its immediate
appearances. It seeks to penetrate beyond the surface to find the truth behind
being.

Step 2: **Mediated Knowledge of Essence**
- Knowledge doesn't stop at immediate being but looks beyond it. This suggests
that essence is not directly accessible but requires a process of mediation to
be understood.
- Essence is presented as something "other than being itself," a background
that constitutes the truth of being.

Step 3: **Mediated Knowledge as Movement of Being**
- The movement described as a pathway of knowledge, which starts with being
and advances to sublate being into essence, is presented as being intrinsic to
being itself. The movement is not external to being but part of its nature.

Step 4: **Being's Nature to Recollect Itself**
- It's explained that being's nature is to recollect itself, leading to its
transformation into essence through interiorizing and self-sublation.

Step 5: **Determination of the Absolute as Essence**
- The absolute, initially determined as being, is now determined as essence.
- The term "essence" is related to the past participle of the verb "to be,"
implying that essence is something timeless and past, yet still relevant.

Step 6: **Characteristics of Essence**
- Essence is introduced as being-in-and-for-itself, a state of absolute
self-sufficiency and indifference to determinateness of being.
- Essence is both a simple unity and a self-sublation of otherness and
determinateness.

Step 7: **Essence's Transition from Being**
- The transition from being to essence is explained: being is negated and
distilled to create pure essence.
- This transition involves a removal of determinateness, leading to an essence
that is void of determination.

Step 8: **Essence as Simple Negativity**
- Essence's nature as simple negativity, leading to its self-existence and
being-for-itself, is highlighted.
- This self-existence is not mere abstraction but a dynamic process of
self-reference and self-sublation.

Step 9: **Essence as Reflection**
- Essence is characterized as reflection within itself.
- This reflection determines its own essence, creating a self-reflective
dynamic.

Step 10: **Essence's Determinations**
- The reflective determinations or essentialities of essence are acknowledged.
- Essence's determinations are posited by itself and retained within its unity.

Step 11: **Essence's Transition to Concrete Existence**
- The reflection of immanent determining within essence leads to its
transformation into concrete existence and appearance.

The excerpt as a whole demonstrates Hegel's complex philosophical style, where
concepts like essence, being, reflection, self-reference, and sublation are
explored in intricate detail. The argument presented involves a progression of
ideas and concepts, each building upon the previous step to provide a deeper
understanding of essence and its relationship with being.

**B. SHINE**

Certainly, I'd be happy to break down this text into key steps and provide
comments on each step:

**Step 1: Introduction to Shine as Sublated Being**
- Shine is introduced as a concept distinct from being. It is characterized as
the sublatedness of being, meaning it exists as the result of negating being
and is based on the nothingness of being.
- Shine's existence is rooted in essence and is distinct from being and
essence.

**Step 2: Immediate Side and Otherness of Shine**
- Although shine appears to have an immediate side independent of essence,
it's explained that this immediacy is actually a non-existence within the
determinateness of being. Shine's existence is dependent on another and its
own non-existence.
- Shine is characterized as the "phenomenon" of skepticism and the
"appearance" of idealism, highlighting its nature as something elusive and
non-existent in itself.

**Step 3: Transition to Shine's Determination**
- The text delves into the nature of shine as immediate non-existence, a
reflection of skepticism and idealism. It's emphasized that shine encompasses
a manifold of determinations.
- Shine's content lacks a true foundation or being, existing only as
transposed content from being into shine.

**Step 4: Shine's Relation to Determining Reflection**
- Shine is characterized as essence itself within the determinateness of
being. It's distinguished from essence's absolute unity and is said to contain
its own manifold determinacies.
- Determining reflection is introduced as a unity of positing and external
reflection, involving the connection of immediate being with essence.

**C. REFLECTION**

**Step 5: Unity of Positing and External Reflection**
- Determining reflection is further explained as a unity of positing and
external reflection. The text delves into the relationship between
positedness, existence, and essence.
- The notion of determinate shine is explored as the essential shine within
essence, where determinations are fixed by their self-equality in reflection.

**Step 6: Self-Equality and Immanent Reflection**
- Determining reflection's nature is clarified by focusing on its dual sides:
positedness and immanent reflection. Positedness is described as negation,
while immanent reflection refers to the reflection of the determination.
- The text emphasizes that determination is a unity of positedness and
immanent reflection, providing insight into its nature and relationship with
other concepts.

**Step 7: Determination's Reference to Otherness**
- Determination's reference to its own negation is highlighted. It's
contrasted with the concept of quality, where determinations have an external
reference to others.
- Determination is described as a self-contained unity of itself and its
other, characterized by its own reflection into itself.

**Step 8: Conclusion of the Argument**
- The text concludes by reiterating the nature of determination as both
positedness and immanent reflection.
- Determination is discussed as a unity of negation, self-reference, and
infinite reference to itself.

Overall, this text explores the concept of shine, its relationship with
essence, and its role in reflection. It delves into the intricate connections
between positedness, reflection, determination, and the self-equality of
essence. The argument is presented in a complex and philosophical manner,
highlighting Hegel's characteristic style of intricate reasoning and analysis.

IV.4
pravrtti-bhede prayojakam cittam ekam anekesam

Certainly, the text you've provided is quite dense and intricate. It seems to
be discussing the concepts of reflection, identity, difference, diversity,
likeness, unlikeness, and opposition. I'll do my best to break down the
argument step by step and provide commentary for each section. Keep in mind
that due to the complexity and abstract nature of the text, this breakdown
might still appear complex.

### Step 1: Introduction and Context
The passage is discussing the concepts related to reflection, identity, and
difference. It seeks to elaborate on how these concepts relate to each other
and form the foundation of further philosophical exploration.

Please note that this commentary is an attempt to provide an overview of the
complex ideas presented in the text. Philosophical texts often require careful
and repeated reading to fully grasp their meanings and implications.

IV.5
tatra dhyana-jam anasayam

Certainly, I'll break down the provided text into smaller sections and provide
commentary for each section. Please note that the original text is quite
abstract and complex, so the commentary aims to capture the main ideas and
relationships within the text.

### Section 1: Introduction to Contradiction

The section introduces the concept of contradiction and how it manifests in
various stages of differentiation and opposition.

**Commentary:** The text begins by discussing the nature of contradiction,
particularly in relation to difference, diversity, and opposition. It sets the
stage for exploring how these concepts interact and lead to contradictions.

### Section 2: Self-Subsistence and Opposition

This section explores how opposition contains both positive and negative
elements, leading to self-subsistence and contradiction.

**Commentary:** The text discusses how opposition contains the positive and
negative moments that are self-subsistent and self-contained. It emphasizes
that each moment includes a reference to the other, creating a self-contained
opposition.

### Section 3: Contradiction's Resolving

The text delves into how contradiction resolves itself through
self-transformation and self-reference.

**Commentary:** This section elaborates on how contradiction is resolved
through self-transformation. Positive and negative elements negate themselves,
leading to the emergence of the "null." It discusses the dynamic process
through which contradictions lead to a foundational unity.

### Section 4: Essence as Ground

The section explains how contradiction leads to essence as a ground where
positive and negative elements are unified.

**Commentary:** The text introduces the concept of "ground" as the unity that
arises from contradiction. It explains how opposition transforms into ground,
where positive and negative elements are integrated. Essence becomes
self-identical through this process.

### Section 5: Conclusion

The text concludes by summarizing how essence becomes self-identical through
the process of contradiction and self-transformation.

**Commentary:** The text wraps up by summarizing how the contradictory nature
of self-subsistent opposition leads to essence becoming self-identical through
the resolution of opposition and the emergence of ground.

Please note that this breakdown is a simplification of the complex concepts
presented in the text. The original text delves into philosophical ideas and
intricate relationships between concepts, so multiple readings and further
exploration may be necessary to fully understand its nuances.

CHAPTER 3

Ground

Essence determines itself as ground.

IV.6
karma-asukla-akrsnam yogina trividham itaresam

This text from Chapter 3 discusses the concept of "Ground" within the context
of essence and reflection. It explores how essence transforms into ground
through self-determination, and how ground serves as a mediating force within
the realm of existence.

### Essence as Ground

Essence transitions into ground, characterized by the reflection of being into
itself, creating a pure reflection that serves as the foundation for the
subsequent discussion.

**Commentary:** The text introduces the concept of essence transforming into
ground. Just as being is not initially in immediate unity with itself, essence
is initially united with its own absolute negativity. Essence's reflection
turns being back into itself, forming the ground into which being dissolves.
Essence's reflection posits itself as a negative and determines itself.

### Self-Subsistent Determinations and Sublation

Self-subsisting determinations of reflection sublate themselves, leading to
the true determination of essence within ground.

**Commentary:** The text discusses how the self-subsisting determinations of
reflection negate themselves, resulting in the true determination of essence
within ground. The positive and negative elements play a role in this process
of sublation.

### Determination as Sublated Determination

The concept of determination as sublated determination is introduced within
the context of ground, where essence determines itself through self-sublation.

**Commentary:** The text elaborates on the concept of determination as
sublated determination within the framework of ground. Essence's
self-sublating nature is emphasized, where essence becomes self-identical
through the negation of its determinations.

### Essence's Transition to Ground

Essence's transition to ground is discussed, highlighting how this transition
is grounded within essence itself.

**Commentary:** The text explains how essence transitions to ground from a
state of immediate determination. The movement from determination to ground is
a process within essence, and ground is determined by this self-transition.

### Mediation and Reflection

The difference between pure mediation and real mediation is discussed,
emphasizing the role of reflection in grounding essence.

**Commentary:** The text contrasts pure mediation with real mediation, with
real mediation being the mediation of essence with itself through reflection.
Ground is described as essence turning back into itself through its non-being,
and this process involves the determination of immediacy.

### Ground's Determinations

The multifaceted nature of ground's determinations is explored, highlighting
its role in connecting form and matter and conditioning mediation.

**Commentary:** The text discusses how ground takes on various forms. It is
characterized as absolute ground, serving as a substrate for the
ground-connection. Ground also takes on determinate forms, becoming the ground
of determinate content. Additionally, the concept of conditioning mediation
and the interplay between ground and condition are introduced.

### Conclusion

The passage concludes by discussing the relationship between ground and
condition, highlighting how they mutually presuppose each other, and how the
unconditioned state represents their unity.

**Commentary:** The text wraps up by emphasizing the interdependent
relationship between ground and condition. The unconditioned state signifies
the unity between these concepts, representing the culmination of their
mediation and existence.

Please keep in mind that the text is philosophically dense and abstract,
making interpretation subject to perspective. This commentary provides a
simplified overview of the main themes and ideas discussed in this chapter.

IV.7
tatas tad-vipaka-anugunanam eva-abhivyakti vasananam

This section of the text from Chapter 3 focuses on the relationship between
"Form," "Matter," and "Content" within the context of the concept of "Absolute
Ground." It delves into the intricate interplay between these concepts, how
they relate to each other, and how they contribute to the development of the
notion of ground.

### Form and Essence

Form is introduced as a determination of reflection that returns into the
ground. While existence presupposes a ground and is posited, the ground is a
sublated positedness. The determinateness of the ground involves both essence
as ground and what is grounded (immediate existence). This positedness is
self-identical negative and positive. Form is the self-identity of positive or
positedness, while matter is the self-identity of the negative or
non-positedness.

**Commentary:** The text delves into the complex relationship between form and
essence, highlighting how form returns to the ground and engages with the
concepts of positedness and non-positedness. The dynamic between the
self-identity of the positive and the negative is emphasized.

### Form and Matter

The text discusses how form and matter presuppose each other, leading to their
unity as substrate. Matter is absolute negativity and contradiction, holding
the contradiction that form contains. They mutually relate to each other, each
being a reflection of the other's negativity.

**Commentary:** The text explores the relationship between form and matter,
portraying them as interconnected and mutually dependent. It delves into how
their interactions and contradictions contribute to their unity as a substrate.

### Form and Content

Content emerges as the unity of form and matter. The unity of content is both
indifferent to form and also serves as the ground. Content's self-identity is
tied to form and ground-connection. The concepts of form, content, and ground
become interwoven, forming a complex relationship.

**Commentary:** The text highlights the interplay between form, matter, and
content, emphasizing how content embodies the unity of the two while also
being connected to the ground. This intricate relationship demonstrates the
interdependence of these philosophical concepts.

This section of the text presents intricate ideas and concepts related to
form, matter, and content within the framework of "Absolute Ground." It
addresses the relationships and transformations between these elements and how
they contribute to the broader philosophical discussion.

IV.8
jati-desa-kala vyavahitanam api-anantaryam smrti-samskarayo eka-rupatvat

Certainly, I can help break down the argument into steps and provide comments
on each step. However, please note that the text you've provided is quite
dense and abstract, and understanding its full context and implications might
require a deep understanding of the philosophical framework it belongs to.
With that in mind, here's a simplified breakdown of the argument along with
comments on each step:

---

**Argument Breakdown:**

**Section B: DETERMINATE GROUND**

**a. Formal ground**

**Step 1:** The ground is introduced as having determinate content.

*Comment:* The text starts by discussing the concept of "ground," which is
presented as having specific content.

**Step 2:** The ground's determinateness of content contrasts with the
mediation of form.

*Comment:* The determinateness of content is presented as being distinct from
the role of mediation that form plays.

**Step 3:** The ground is identified as a negatively self-referring identity
that becomes posited.

*Comment:* The ground is described as having a negative self-reference that
leads it to become posited or asserted.

**Step 4:** The ground's identity is linked to its content, constituting a
positive unity in the ground-connection.

*Comment:* The identity of the ground and its content is discussed,
emphasizing the unity created by the ground-connection.

**Step 5:** The mediation between the ground and the grounded is described as
formal mediation.

*Comment:* The process of mediation between the ground and what it grounds is
labeled as "formal mediation."

**Step 6:** The ground and the grounded mutually posit themselves into an
identity.

*Comment:* Both the ground and the grounded mutually establish themselves as
interconnected and part of a unified identity.

**Step 7:** The determinate content becomes the basis of formal mediation.

*Comment:* The specific content that is determined becomes the foundation for
the formal mediation between the ground and what is grounded.

**Step 8:** The determinate content's identity serves as the substrate for
both form and content.

*Comment:* The identity of the content is described as the substrate for both
form and content, illustrating their interconnectedness.

**Step 9:** The sufficiency of the ground is highlighted, indicating that
everything in the grounded is in the ground.

*Comment:* The ground is presented as sufficient to account for everything
found in what it grounds.

**b. Real ground**

**Step 10:** The diversity of content leads to external determinations and
loss of self-identity.

*Comment:* When the content becomes diverse, the ground-connection loses its
self-identity and leads to external determinations.

**Step 11:** The distinction between essential and unessential content is
introduced.

*Comment:* The text discusses the differentiation between essential and
unessential content within the grounded.

**Step 12:** The content connections become external, breaking down the
self-identity of the ground-connection.

*Comment:* The connections between content become external, causing the
self-identity of the ground-connection to break down.

**Step 13:** The ground becomes external and references something else.

*Comment:* The ground becomes external and refers to something other than
itself, indicating a shift in its nature.

**c. Complete ground**

**Step 14:** The ground and its connection become substrates.

*Comment:* The ground and its connection are presented as substrates, implying
a shift in their roles.

**Step 15:** The new ground becomes an immanent reflection of the connection.

*Comment:* The new ground is described as an immanent reflection of the
connection, showcasing a change in its nature.

**Step 16:** The new ground contains formal and real ground simultaneously.

*Comment:* The new ground is depicted as containing both formal and real
ground aspects simultaneously.

**Step 17:** The new ground mediates between the two content determinations.

*Comment:* The new ground is portrayed as mediating between two content
determinations, bridging the gap between them.

**Step 18:** The ground-connection becomes a reflection that posits and
sublates itself.

*Comment:* The ground-connection becomes a reflection that both posits and
negates itself.

IV.9
tasam anaditvam ca-asisa nityatvat

**Argument Breakdown:**

**Section C: CONDITION**

**a. The relatively unconditioned**

**Step 1:** Ground is immediate and grounded is mediated. Ground posits
itself, making itself into positedness and presupposing reflection.

*Comment:* The nature of ground and grounded is introduced, highlighting how
ground involves self-reflection and positing itself, leading to presupposed
reflection.

**Step 2:** Mediation from the immediate to the ground is not external but a
result of the ground's self-externalizing reflection. Condition is introduced
as what the ground refers to as its essential presupposition.

*Comment:* The process of mediation is discussed as being intrinsic to the
ground's self-externalization. "Condition" is introduced as an important
concept that the ground refers to.

**Step 3:** Condition is described as immediate existence referred to another,
something posited for another, and as the form-connection of ground withdrawn
into self-identity.

*Comment:* The nature of condition is explored, including its immediacy,
reference to another, and its role as a form-connection within the ground.

**Step 4:** The content of ground is described as a unity of form and content,
but this unity frees itself in complete ground, becoming external to its
identity.

*Comment:* The concept of content within ground is discussed, focusing on its
unity of form and content, and how this unity changes in the complete ground.

**Step 5:** Condition becomes the content of ground, but this content is
indifferent to form.

*Comment:* Condition's role as content within the ground is discussed,
emphasizing its indifference to form.

**Step 6:** Existence posited as condition loses its immediacy and becomes the
unconditioned moment of another. Condition is conditioned by the ground, but
this condition is external to it.

*Comment:* The transformation of existence into condition is explored, showing
how condition becomes the unconditioned moment of another while being
conditioned by the ground.

**Step 7:** Condition is not the ground's movement or self-positing; the
ground-connection is introduced as the empty movement of reflection.

*Comment:* The distinction between condition and ground-connection is
established, with ground-connection described as the movement of reflection.

**Step 8:** Ground-connection is the self-subsistent process of mediation and
has a peculiar content as opposed to the content of condition.

*Comment:* The nature of ground-connection is further elaborated, highlighting
its role as a self-subsistent process of mediation.

**Step 9:** Condition and ground are indifferent and unconditioned with
respect to each other, but they are also mediated. Condition is the in-itself
of the ground, which is then sublated.

*Comment:* The relationship between condition and ground is discussed,
emphasizing their dual nature of indifference and mediation.

---

The argument presented in this section delves into the concepts of ground,
condition, and the relationship between them. It explores how ground posits
itself and refers to condition as its essential presupposition. The text also
differentiates between condition and ground-connection, showcasing their
distinct roles in the overall argument. The concepts of immediacy, mediation,
and self-externalization are central to this section's exploration of the
interplay between ground and condition.

As with the previous sections, the language and concepts used here are quite
intricate and may require a deep understanding of the philosophical context to
fully grasp the nuances and implications of the argument.

**Argument Breakdown:**

**Section C: CONDITION**

**b. The absolutely unconditioned**

**Step 1:** The two sides (condition and ground) reflectively shine in each
other. Condition is immediate existence reflected in the form connection of
the ground, and vice versa. However, each side stands on its own and has its
own content.

*Comment:* The reflective relationship between condition and ground is
explored, highlighting how they shine in each other and yet retain their
individuality.

**Step 2:** Condition's form has moments of positedness and in-itself,
constituting its essentiality as material and moment of the ground, as well as
its reflection into itself.

*Comment:* The dual nature of condition's form is discussed, including its
role as both material for the ground and as its essentiality.

**Step 3:** Existence sublates itself in its immediacy and founders to the
ground. Being becomes essence through negation and self-reflection.

*Comment:* The transformative nature of existence becoming essence through
negation and self-reflection is elaborated upon.

**Step 4:** The form determinations of condition are not external to immediate
existence; they are reflections within it.

*Comment:* The relationship between form determinations and immediate
existence is clarified, emphasizing the internal nature of their relationship.

**Step 5:** Condition is posited as a moment and in-itself of an other, but
both are moments of each other due to mediation through ground.

*Comment:* The dynamic relationship between condition and ground is discussed,
focusing on their interplay and mutual mediation.

**Step 6:** The whole form and content of the ground-connection are described,
with condition being both presupposed in-itself and a positedness.

*Comment:* The nature of condition and ground-connection as a whole form and
content is explored, highlighting their reciprocal relationship.

**Step 7:** The content of condition is discussed as essential content that
forms self-identity in the form, making it informed matter.

*Comment:* The concept of content within condition is elaborated, explaining
its role in forming self-identity.

**Step 8:** The unity between condition and ground is highlighted as both form
and content, with them reflecting and presupposing each other.

*Comment:* The unity between condition and ground is emphasized as both form
and content, demonstrating their interdependence.

**Step 9:** The reflective shine between condition and ground diminishes as
they reach the absolutely unconditioned. The unconditioned fact is the
condition of both, with its relation to them being a rejoining itself.

*Comment:* The argument concludes by explaining how the reflective
relationship between condition and ground fades as they reach the absolutely
unconditioned, leading to the rejoining of their relationship within the
unconditioned fact.

---

This section further delves into the interplay between condition and ground,
exploring how they reflect each other and form a unity as both content and
form. The concept of the absolutely unconditioned is introduced, revealing how
condition and ground merge into a higher unity that encompasses them. The
progression of thought leads to the idea that the reflective relationship
between condition and ground is ultimately a reflection of the unconditioned
fact's own self-activity.

As with the rest of the text, the language and concepts used in this argument
are complex and require a deep engagement with the philosophical context to

**Argument Breakdown:**

**Section C: CONDITION**

**c. Procession of the fact into concrete existence**

**Step 1:** The absolutely unconditioned is the absolute ground identical with
its condition, forming the essential fact. It becomes a positedness through
reflection, where the reflection is complete in both its sides.

*Comment:* The transition from the absolutely unconditioned to concrete
existence is explored, highlighting the identity between ground and condition.

**Step 2:** The positedness is first the sublated ground, representing
immediacy void of reflection, forming the totality of fact's determinations.

*Comment:* The concept of positedness is explained, focusing on its
relationship with sublated ground and the diverse determinations within the
fact.

**Step 3:** Conditions are the whole content of the fact, forming the
unconditioned in the form of formless being, but they also take other shapes
beyond the conditions of content.

*Comment:* The dual nature of conditions as both the unconditioned and the
diverse content is discussed, along with their relationship to formless being.

**Step 4:** The absolute fact treats the sphere of being as its condition, and
its reflection sublates the immediacy of conditions, making them moments
within the unity of the fact.

*Comment:* The interplay between the absolute fact and the sphere of being is
elaborated, revealing how reflection sublates immediacy.

**Step 5:** The fact's movement of being posited through conditions and ground
is discussed as a coming forth, a self-staging of the fact in concrete
existence.

*Comment:* The concept of the fact's movement of becoming concrete is
explored, focusing on its process of self-staging.

**Step 6:** When all conditions of a fact are present, the fact steps into
concrete existence, with its essence and immediate existence coming together.

*Comment:* The realization of a fact into concrete existence is explained,
emphasizing the role of conditions and immediate existence.

**Step 7:** The fact proceeds from the ground, not as a substrate, but as a
union with conditions, where the truth of grounding is the unity of the ground
with itself.

*Comment:* The role of the ground and its relationship with the fact's
emergence into existence are discussed.

**Step 8:** Concrete existence is immediate, mediated by ground and condition,
and self-identical through the sublating of mediation.

*Comment:* The concept of concrete existence and its immediacy, mediated
nature, and self-identity are elaborated upon.

---

This section concludes the exploration of the transition from the absolutely
unconditioned to concrete existence, emphasizing the role of ground,
condition, and the reflective shine in this process. It highlights how
concrete existence is the outcome of the interplay between conditions and
ground, resulting in the fact's immediate presence.

As with the rest of the text, the language and concepts used in this argument
require a deep engagement with the philosophical context to fully grasp their
implications and significance.

B. APPEARANCE

IV.11
atita-anagatam svarupato asti-adhva-bheda dharmanam

IV.12
te vyakta-suksma guna-atmana

Certainly, I can help break down the text into precise steps and provide
comments on each step. However, please note that Hegel's writing can be
complex and philosophical, so my attempt to break it down into distinct steps
might not perfectly capture the nuances of his argument. Here's a simplified
breakdown of the text and commentary on each step within the "Appearance"
section:

**Step 1: Essence Must Appear**
Hegel starts by asserting that essence must manifest itself in some form.
Essence is the fundamental nature of things, and it needs to become apparent
or manifest.

**Commentary:** This step sets the stage for the discussion on appearance.
Hegel is addressing the concept of essence and its relationship with
appearance. He's emphasizing the necessity for essence to become evident or
tangible in some way.

**Step 2: Essence as Reflection Within**
Hegel introduces the idea that essence involves a process of reflection within
itself. Essence contains various reflective aspects, which contribute to its
understanding.

**Commentary:** Essence is not a static concept; it involves internal
reflection and self-differentiation. This step prepares the reader for the
discussion on appearance, where these reflective aspects come into play.

**Step 3: The Determinations of Reflection in Unity**
Hegel explains that the determinations of reflection are unified within
essence. These determinations are posited and then sublated, contributing to
the internal unity of essence.

**Commentary:** The unity of the determinations within essence is essential
for understanding how appearance arises. Hegel is laying the groundwork for
explaining how these determinations contribute to the process of appearance.

**Step 4: The Reflection of Ground in Concrete Existence**
Hegel introduces the idea that the reflective nature of ground results in a
concrete existence. This concrete existence is immediate and grounded in
reflection.

**Commentary:** This step sets the stage for the transition from essence to
appearance. Hegel is connecting the concept of ground to the emergence of
concrete existence, which is crucial for the upcoming discussion on appearance.

**Step 5: Concrete Existence as the Thing**
Concrete existence is described as a thing, an undifferentiated unity of
essence and immediacy. The thing contains reflection within it but is grounded
in immediacy.

**Commentary:** Hegel is introducing the concept of the "thing" and how it
relates to concrete existence. The unity of essence and immediacy is important
for understanding how the thing is formed.

**Step 6: Appearance as Truth of the Thing**
Appearance is introduced as the truth of the thing. Appearance reveals the
essential nature of the thing, and there's a reciprocal relationship between
appearance and essential being.

**Commentary:** This step introduces the concept of appearance and its
relation to the truth of the thing. Hegel is setting the stage for discussing
how appearance relates to the essential nature of the thing.

**Step 7: Essential Relation**
Hegel explains that appearance demonstrates essential relation. This relation
involves the interplay between reflection into otherness and reflection into
itself.

**Commentary:** Essential relation is discussed in relation to appearance.
This step prepares the reader for understanding how essential relation
connects appearance with the broader concept of actuality.

These steps provide a simplified breakdown of the text within the "Appearance"
section and offer commentary to aid in understanding the progression of ideas.
Keep in mind that Hegel's writing is dense and requires careful consideration
to fully grasp his philosophical insights.

IV.13
parinama-ekatvad vastu-tattvam

Certainly, I can break down this section of the text into precise steps and
provide comments on each step. Here's a simplified breakdown and commentary on
each step within the section titled "A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES":

**Step 1: Concrete Existence as Negative Unity and Immediate Determination**
Concrete existence is initially presented as a negative unity, an immediate
determination that encompasses the idea of "something." The concrete existent
is an immediacy that results from the reflection of mediation within itself,
giving rise to the concept of a "thing."

**Commentary:** This step establishes the foundation for discussing the
relationship between concrete existence and the concept of a thing. Hegel
introduces the idea of immediate determination and its connection to the
concept of a thing.

**Step 2: Distinction between Thing and Concrete Existence**
Hegel explains that while the thing and concrete existence are initially one
and the same, the concretely existent something is distinct from the something
that exists immediately. The concretely existent something arises through
reflection and becomes a "thing."

**Commentary:** This step emphasizes the distinction between the initial
immediacy and the emergence of a thing through reflection. It sets the stage
for exploring the characteristics of the thing.

**Step 3: Thing-in-Itself and Its Properties**
Hegel introduces the concept of the "thing-in-itself," which is the concrete
existent as essential immediacy that has resulted from sublated mediation. The
thing-in-itself has aspects that mirror its reflection. Properties emerge as
determinations that characterize the thing.

**Commentary:** This step introduces the idea of the "thing-in-itself" and its
relation to properties. It lays the groundwork for the exploration of how
properties define and differentiate things.

**Step 4: Relation of Thing-in-Itself and Properties**
Hegel discusses the relationship between the thing-in-itself and properties.
The thing-in-itself contains both essential unity and diverse aspects. The
reflection of the unessential concrete existence within the thing-in-itself
leads to the emergence of multiple things-in-themselves.

**Commentary:** This step delves into the dynamics of the thing-in-itself and
its relation to properties. Hegel emphasizes how the reflection within the
thing-in-itself leads to a diversity of things.

**Step 5: External Reflection and Reciprocal Action**
Hegel explains how external reflection influences the relationship between
things-in-themselves. Things-in-themselves interact through properties,
forming a reciprocal action. The property is the connecting reference between
things.

**Commentary:** This step introduces the concept of external reflection and
its role in the reciprocal action of things. Hegel highlights the importance
of properties in shaping interactions between things.

**Step 6: Indeterminate Self-Identity and Properties**
Hegel discusses how thinghood is reduced to indeterminate self-identity,
dependent on properties. Without properties, things become quantitatively
indifferent. Properties are the basis for differentiation and self-identity.

**Commentary:** This step elaborates on how properties define the
self-identity and differentiation of things. Hegel underscores the role of
properties in determining the nature of individual things.

**Step 7: The Self-Subsistence of Properties**
Hegel explains that properties, which were thought to connect self-subsisting
extremes, are themselves self-subsistent. Things exist as the
self-differentiating reflection, which is the property. The property becomes
the essential matter, while things are considered unessential.

**Commentary:** This step discusses the inversion of values between things and
properties. Hegel emphasizes how properties become the self-subsisting
elements, while things are seen as less substantial.

**Step 8: The Diversity of Self-Subsistent Matters**
Hegel introduces the concept of self-subsistent matters, which are simple
continuities with themselves. A manifold of self-subsistent matters
constitutes the thing.

**Commentary:** This step explores the notion of self-subsistent matters and
their relation to things. Hegel highlights the diversity of self-subsistent
matters that collectively form a thing.

This breakdown and commentary aim to provide a simplified understanding of
Hegel's argument within the "A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES" section.
However, Hegel's text is complex, and his philosophical ideas are layered. The
commentary provides a general interpretation, but further study and engagement
with the full context of Hegel's work are recommended for a deeper
understanding.

IV.14
vastu-samye citta-bhedat tayo vibhakta pantha

Sure, I can break down and comment on the content of this section as well.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown along with commentary for the section titled
"B. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE THING OUT OF MATTERS":

**Step 1: Transition from Properties to Matters**
Hegel introduces the transition from properties to matters, similar to how
chemistry represents properties like color, smell, etc., as specific types of
matter (e.g., luminous matter, coloring matter). He mentions that things are
often seen as consisting of various matters or stuffs.

**Commentary:** In this step, Hegel draws a parallel between the philosophical
concept of properties transitioning into matters and how chemistry represents
properties in terms of specific types of matter. This analogy sets the stage
for discussing the relationship between properties and matters within his
philosophical framework.

**Step 2: Properties as Essential and Self-Subsistent**
Hegel explains that the transition from properties to matters arises from the
understanding that properties are essential in things and possess true
self-subsistence. He mentions that thinghood, which involves negative
reflection and repulsion from the other, has been reduced to an unessential
aspect.

**Commentary:** Hegel delves into the necessity of considering properties as
essential and self-subsistent. He also highlights the reduction of thinghood
to an unessential moment and sets the context for how this transition impacts
the nature of things.

**Step 3: Transition to Self-Subsistent Matters**
Hegel discusses how the continuity of property with itself contains the
negative moment. He states that the transition from properties to matters
results in self-subsistent matters, leading to the progression of the thing
from indeterminacy to full determinateness.

**Commentary:** In this step, Hegel emphasizes how the continuity of
properties within themselves leads to the emergence of self-subsistent
matters. This transition marks the development of the thing's determinateness
and its relation to self-subsistent matters.

**Step 4: Turning Back into Itself**
Hegel discusses how the thing's turning back into itself is both a
self-referring determination and an unessential determination. He explains
that the self-subsistent matter contains the difference of things but is
external to them.

**Commentary:** Hegel elaborates on the concept of the thing turning back into
itself and how this relates to self-subsistent matters. He contrasts the
self-subsistent matter's external nature with its role in determining the
thing's self-identity.

**Step 5: Result from the Movement of Property**
Hegel discusses how the property's unity of externality and essentiality
repels itself. He states that the thing frees itself from negative sides and
returns to itself, becoming self-identical. The properties become
self-subsistent matters, and the thing is a self-identical negation against
the positive continuity of the material.

**Commentary:** Hegel highlights the interplay between the property,
self-subsistent matters, and the thing's self-identity. He discusses how the
properties become self-subsistent, leading to the thing's self-identical
negation against the material's positive continuity.

**Step 6: Complete Determinateness and Self-Subsistent Matters**
Hegel explains that the "this" constitutes the complete determinateness of the
thing, characterized by self-subsistent matters. He describes how these
matters are indifferent to their connection in the thing and continue into
other things.

**Commentary:** This step emphasizes that the "this" represents the full
determinateness of the thing, characterized by self-subsistent matters. Hegel
also touches on how these matters relate to each other within the thing and
beyond.

Hegel's writing in this section is dense and complex, exploring the
relationship between properties, matters, and the constitution of things. The
commentary provided here is a simplified overview of his ideas, and engaging
with the full context of his work is essential for a deeper understanding.

IV.15
na ca-eka-citta-tantram vastu tad apramanakam tada kim syat

Certainly, I'll break down and comment on the content of this section as well.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown along with commentary for the section titled
"C. DISSOLUTION OF THE THING":

**Step 1: Absolute Alterability of the Thing**
Hegel explains that the thing, in its form as the quantitative combination of
free matters, is completely alterable. Alteration involves adding or dropping
matters, or rearranging their quantitative ratios.

**Commentary:** Hegel discusses how the thing's composition of self-subsistent
matters makes it inherently alterable. He highlights the external nature of
this alteration and how it relates to the quantitative aspects of the thing's
constitution.

**Step 2: External Dissolution**
Hegel describes the coming-to-be and passing-away of the thing as external
dissolution. The thing's composition is merely external connections or bonds
between self-subsistent matters, and they circulate freely in and out of the
thing.

**Commentary:** In this step, Hegel elaborates on the external nature of the
thing's dissolution. He emphasizes that the thing's composition is primarily
based on external bonds and that the circulation of matters is a significant
aspect of this dissolution.

**Step 3: The Thing's Nature as Absolutely Dissoluble**
Hegel asserts that the thing, as a "this" determined by its properties, is
inherently dissoluble. The thing's determinate nature is its essential
feature, and this dissolution process is also external, much like the thing
itself.

**Commentary:** Hegel reinforces the idea that the thing's essential nature is
its determinateness, and this determinateness makes it inherently dissoluble.
He highlights how the external dissolution aligns with the external character
of the thing.

**Step 4: Thing's Connection with Matters**
Hegel discusses the relationship between the thing and the self-subsistent
matters it consists of. The matters lack negative self-subsistence; instead,
the properties are self-subsistent due to their reflection into themselves.

**Commentary:** Hegel contrasts the self-subsistent nature of properties with
the matters that lack negative self-subsistence. He points out the importance
of properties as the foundation for self-subsistence and highlights the
distinction between properties and matters.

**Step 5: Negative Reflection and Puncticity**
Hegel explains that the matters' content is their determinateness, and their
immanent reflection is only the form of this content. The matters have a
negative connection and puncticity within the thing.

**Commentary:** Hegel delves into the relationship between the matters'
content and their immanent reflection. He introduces the concept of
puncticity, which refers to the punctuated nature of the negative connection
between matters within the thing.

**Step 6: The Thing as Connecting Reference**
Hegel describes how the thing serves as a connecting reference for its
matters. While one matter subsists in the thing, the presence of one matter
may lead to the sublation of another matter within the thing.

**Commentary:** Hegel explains how the thing acts as a connecting reference
for the matters it consists of. He discusses how the subsistence of one matter
can impact the subsistence or sublation of another matter, illustrating the
dynamic interaction between matters.

**Step 7: Interpenetration and Porosity**
Hegel introduces the idea of interpenetration among matters within the thing.
Matters interpenetrate while maintaining their self-subsistence, resulting in
a porous nature of the thing.

**Commentary:** Hegel discusses how matters interpenetrate within the thing
without directly affecting one another due to their self-subsistent nature. He
introduces the concept of porosity, where matters exist within the same space
yet maintain their distinct self-subsistence.

**Step 8: Self-Contradictory Mediation**
Hegel characterizes the thing as a self-contradictory mediation between
independent self-subsistence and its negation. The thing mediates between
self-subsisting matters, reflecting their interplay.

**Commentary:** Hegel describes how the thing embodies a self-contradictory
mediation between independent self-subsistence and negation. This mediation
highlights the complex relationship between self-subsisting matters and their
interactions within the thing.

**Step 9: Completion of Concrete Existence**
Hegel concludes that concrete existence attains its completion in the thing.
Concrete existence involves both independent subsistence and unessential
concrete existence, resulting in appearance.

**Commentary:** Hegel wraps up this section by discussing the culmination of
concrete existence in the thing. He introduces the idea that appearance arises
from the juxtaposition of independent subsistence and unessential concrete
existence within the thing.

This section explores the dissolution of the thing, its composition of
self-subsistent matters, and the complex dynamics that arise from their
interplay. Hegel's intricate language and concepts underscore the
philosophical depth of his analysis.

CHAPTER 2

Appearance

IV.16
tad-uparaga-apeksitvat-cittasya vastu jnata-ajnatam

Certainly, I'll break down and comment on the content of this section as well.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown along with commentary for the section titled
"C. THE LAW OF APPEARANCE":

**Step 1: Appearance and Concrete Existence**
Hegel explains that appearance is concrete existence mediated through its
negation. This negation is another self-subsistent being that's essentially
sublated. Appearance reflects into itself through negation and the negation of
this negation, resulting in essential self-subsistence and absolute
positedness with a ground and other for subsistence.

**Commentary:** Hegel introduces the idea that appearance is concrete
existence mediated through a process of negation and reflection. This process
leads to the establishment of essential self-subsistence and positedness,
which is grounded in the interplay of negations.

**Step 2: Positive Identity in Appearance**
Hegel discusses how appearance contains both reflective shine and concrete
existence. Reflective shine is the fleeting moments of negation and reflection
that exist in appearance. Appearance, as an essential content, has both
positive identity and unessential content, illustrating its dynamic nature.

**Commentary:** Hegel elaborates on how appearance embodies both reflective
shine and concrete existence, highlighting their interplay. He emphasizes the
essential nature of appearance's content and its relationship to positive
identity.

**Step 3: The Law of Appearance**
Hegel introduces the law of appearance, explaining that it's the positive
element of the mediation of what appears. The law represents the reflection of
appearance into itself, containing the identical content of both appearance
and unessential concrete existence.

**Commentary:** Hegel introduces the concept of the law of appearance,
emphasizing how it captures the positive aspect of appearance's mediation. He
connects the law's content to appearance's content while noting the
distinction between them.

**Step 4: Law's Relationship with Appearance**
Hegel discusses the relationship between the law and appearance. While the law
reflects immediate identity with concrete existence, appearance still contains
other content not found in the law. Appearance is restless flux and reflection
into other, while the law represents the restful content.

**Commentary:** Hegel contrasts the nature of the law and appearance, with the
law representing immediate identity and appearance embodying dynamic flux and
reflection into other. He highlights the interplay between their different
aspects.

**Step 5: Shortcomings and Unity of the Law**
Hegel notes the shortcomings in the law's connection and unity. At first, the
law's unity is only immediate, and its sides are connected in a posited
manner. The essential unity of the law's sides lies in their negativity, but
this hasn't been fully realized yet.

**Commentary:** Hegel discusses the limitations of the law's connection and
unity, emphasizing that its essential unity hasn't yet fully come to the
forefront. He introduces the concept of negativity as a crucial aspect of the
law's unity.

**Step 6: Law's Essential Form**
Hegel explains that the law represents essential form, but it's not yet real
form that reflects its sides as content. The law is positive essentiality, not
yet the negative essentiality where content determinations pass into their
other.

**Commentary:** Hegel elaborates on the concept of essential form and
introduces the distinction between positive and negative essentiality. He sets
the stage for further exploration of appearance's relationship with the law
and the nature of their unity.

In this section, Hegel delves into the relationship between appearance and the
law, highlighting the interplay of reflection, identity, and mediation. The
complex nature of the law as an essential form is explored in connection with
appearance's dynamic and transient nature.

IV.17
sada jnata citta-vrttaya tat-prabho purusasya-aparinamitvat

Of course, I'll continue to break down and provide commentary on this section
as well. Here's the breakdown and commentary for the section titled "B. THE
WORLD OF APPEARANCE AND THE WORLD-IN-ITSELF":

**Step 1: Concrete World and Kingdom of Laws**
Hegel discusses how the concrete existing world transitions into a kingdom of
laws. The manifold determinate being of the world finds its subsistence in an
other, leading to its dissolution. Appearance's changing nature also includes
endurance, as its positedness becomes law.

**Commentary:** Hegel explores how the concrete world evolves into a realm of
laws through reflection and negation. Appearance's transformation into
enduring law is highlighted.

**Step 2: Law's Relationship with Appearance**
Hegel explains that law is the simple identity of appearance with itself, but
it's also its own opposite. Appearance's content is reflected into itself as
law, creating a connection between them. Law contains moments of negation and
unity, establishing itself as both substrate and opposite of appearance.

**Commentary:** Hegel emphasizes how law is both an essential connection and
opposition to appearance. The concept of law's unity and its opposite nature
are explained in relation to appearance.

**Step 3: Essential World and Appearance**
Hegel introduces the concept of the essential world as a realm that is in and
for itself. This world is suprasensible, existing beyond immediate intuition.
The essential world contains concrete existence but in a more profound sense
than mere being. The concept of things as reflections of this essential world
is introduced.

**Commentary:** Hegel introduces the idea of the essential world as a
suprasensible realm beyond immediate sensory perception. He begins to explore
how this world relates to the world of appearance.

**Step 4: Totality and Opposition**
Hegel describes the essential world as the totality of concrete existence and
absolute negativity. This world's immanent reflection is negative
self-reference, resulting in opposition. The essential world contains the
world of the senses and the world of otherness, which split internally.

**Commentary:** Hegel delves into the nature of the essential world as a
totality that embodies negativity and opposition. He introduces the concept of
the world of the senses and the world of otherness within the essential world.

**Step 5: Connection and Ground**
Hegel discusses how the essential world is the ground of the world of
appearance. It contains both opposition and manifold content. The essential
world is now the totality of the content of appearance, including its negative
moment.

**Commentary:** Hegel elaborates on the relationship between the essential
world and the world of appearance, focusing on their interconnectedness and
opposition. He continues to explore how the essential world relates to
appearance's content.

**Step 6: Identity and Opposition**
Hegel explains how the essential world is both identical with and opposed to
the world of appearance. This connection results in a specific relationship
where the essential world is the inversion of the world of appearance.

**Commentary:** Hegel concludes this section by emphasizing how the essential
world and the world of appearance are interconnected yet also characterized by
opposition. He introduces the concept of inversion as a key aspect of their
relationship.

In this section, Hegel examines the relationship between the essential world
and the world of appearance, highlighting their interplay and opposition. He
explores how the essential world contains and reflects the manifold content of
appearance while also embodying its opposite nature.

IV.18
na tat sva-abhasam drsyatvat

Here's the breakdown and commentary for the section titled "C. THE DISSOLUTION
OF APPEARANCE":

**Step 1: Opposition and Identity**
Hegel discusses how the essential world and the world of appearance are in
opposition, yet their differences disappear as they become interconnected.
Positive attributes in one world correspond to negative attributes in the
other and vice versa. The opposition leads to the realization that both worlds
are interconnected.

**Commentary:** Hegel emphasizes the interconnectedness of the essential world
and the world of appearance through opposition. He introduces the idea that
the two worlds are not isolated but reflect each other's attributes.

**Step 2: Reflection and Self-Reference**
Hegel describes how the world of appearance initially reflects into otherness,
while the essential world is self-identical content. However, the essential
world, when reflecting the world of appearance, incorporates negativity and
self-reference, becoming self-opposed. The essential world retains immediate
concrete existence and becomes sublated ground.

**Commentary:** Hegel delves deeper into the concept of reflection and
self-reference in the context of the two worlds. He highlights how the
essential world, despite its self-identity, incorporates elements of negation
and opposition.

**Step 3: Unity of Totalities**
Hegel explains how the two worlds are each a totality of self-identical
reflection and reflection-into-other. They are both self-subsistent wholes of
concrete existence, with one characterized as reflected concrete existence and
the other as immediate concrete existence. The self-subsistence of each is
rooted in the unity of the two.

**Commentary:** Hegel explores the concept of totalities and the unity that
arises between the two worlds. He introduces the idea that their
self-subsistence is rooted in their mutual interconnectedness.

**Step 4: Realization of Law**
Hegel revisits the concept of law and its realization. Law, which was
initially an internal identity without realization, now becomes truly
identical with itself and its other side. The content of law is raised to
ideality as it reflects into itself, attaining a state of essential relation.

**Commentary:** Hegel elaborates on how law transitions from being an internal
identity to achieving realization and ideality. He emphasizes the significance
of the realization of law and its transformation.

**Step 5: Essential Relation**
Hegel introduces the concept of essential relation as the truth of the
unessential world. The unessential world, with its formless totality of
manifoldness, has foundered as both the essential world and the world of
appearance. Essential relation is the consummation of their unity of form.

**Commentary:** Hegel concludes this section by introducing the concept of
essential relation, which seems to be a higher-level concept that transcends
the previous distinctions between the essential world and the world of
appearance.

In this section, Hegel explores the dissolution of appearance and the
intricate relationship between the essential world and the world of
appearance. He demonstrates how their opposition gives way to
interconnectedness and introduces the concept of essential relation as a
culmination of their unity.

IV.19
eka-samaye ca-ubhaya-anavadharanam

IV.20
citta-antara-drsye buddhi-buddher atiprasanga smrti-sankara ca

Here's the breakdown and commentary for "CHAPTER 3":

**Step 1: Introduction of Essential Relation**
Hegel introduces the concept of the essential relation. This relation contains
immediate self-subsistence, representing both existent immediacy and reflected
immediacy. It's a relative content that exists as a unity with its other and
reflects into itself. The relation has sides, and its sides have independent
subsistence but find meaning in their reference to each other.

**Commentary:** In this chapter, Hegel explores the concept of relation, where
two sides are interconnected and have self-subsistence through their unity and
reference to each other. The term "essential relation" seems to capture the
idea that this connection is fundamental to understanding reality.

**Step 2: Imperfect Identity**
Hegel discusses how the identity within the relation is not yet perfect. Each
side of the relation is self-subsistent, and the unity of the form is
initially only a reference. The sides have immediate moments and are not yet
fully integrated into the unity of the concept. Substance, as the true unity
conforming to the concept, has not yet emerged.

**Commentary:** Hegel delves into the limitations of the concept of relation.
He highlights that the unity within the relation is not fully developed and
that the concept is still in its initial stages.

**Step 3: Whole and Parts**
Hegel introduces the relation of the whole and the parts. In this relation,
both sides are mutually conditioning and presupposing, but neither side is
posited as a moment of the other. The identity between them is one side and
not their negative unity.

**Commentary:** The "whole and parts" relation introduces a structure where
both sides of the relation are interconnected and essential to each other's
existence, but they haven't yet achieved a complete unity.

**Step 4: Force and Expression**
Hegel describes how the relation progresses to a stage where one side becomes
the moment of the other. One side serves as the ground for the other, creating
a relation of force and its expression.

**Commentary:** Hegel introduces the concept of force and expression, where
one side of the relation becomes dominant and shapes the other side. This
progression suggests a dynamic interplay between the two sides.

**Step 5: Inner and Outer**
Hegel explains how the inequality within the relation sublates itself, leading
to the final relation of inner and outer. At this stage, the relation itself
starts to dissolve, and substance or actuality emerges as the absolute unity
of immediate and reflected concrete existence.

**Commentary:** Hegel presents a progression from the relation of whole and
parts to force and expression, and finally to inner and outer. This
progression ultimately leads to the emergence of substance or actuality as the
absolute unity that encompasses both immediate and reflected aspects.

In this chapter, Hegel explores the development of the essential relation and
its various stages, culminating in the emergence of substance or actuality. He
illustrates how the concept of relation evolves and transforms as it moves
through different forms and expressions.
In this section, Hegel discusses the "Relation of Whole and Parts" within the
context of the essential relation:

**Step 1: Self-Subsistence and Immediate Reflection**
- The essential relation contains self-subsistence of concrete existence
reflected into itself.
- This self-subsistence is also reflection into its opposite, immediate
self-subsistence.
- Both sides are posited as concretely existing self-subsistences.
- The whole represents the self-subsistence that constitutes the "world
existing in and for itself."
- The parts represent the immediate concrete existence that was the "world of
appearance."

**Step 2: Reciprocal Conditioning and Self-Externalization**
- The whole and the parts mutually condition each other.
- The whole is a reflected unity with self-subsistence, but it has its
subsistence in its opposite, the parts.
- The parts are immediate and internally manifold, having their
self-subsistence only in the whole.

**Step 3: Indivisible Identity and Differentiated Unity**
- The whole is equal to the parts, and vice versa.
- The whole is a unity with a diversified manifold, holding the parts together.
- The identity of reflection shows that it has this reflection into its other
for truth.
- The parts are equal to the whole as a manifold, as an apportioned whole
(parts).

**Step 4: Destruction of Self-Subsistence and Mediation**
- The whole and parts fall apart, each side referring only to itself.
- The whole, indifferent to the parts, becomes abstract identity.
- The parts, indifferent to the unity of the whole, are the unconnected
manifold.
- The self-reference of each side is their self-subsistence, but it negates
their respective selves.

**Step 5: Truth of the Relation as Mediation**
- The truth of the relation lies in mediation.
- The unity turns back into itself, reflecting unity.
- The reflected unity equally posits itself as sublated.
- The existent immediacy is posited as conditioned through the other.
- The relation of whole and parts transforms into the relation of force and
its expressions.

**Commentary:** In this section, Hegel delves into the complexities of the
relation of whole and parts. He demonstrates how the whole and parts are
intertwined, yet each side is self-subsistent and has a complex relationship
with the other. This intricate dance of self-subsistence and interdependence
leads to the transformation of the relation into the concept of force and its
expressions.
In this section, Hegel delves into the "Relation of Force and Its Expression"
as a development from the previous relation of whole and parts:

**Force and Its Expression**
- Force is the negative unity into which the contradiction of whole and parts
has resolved. It is the higher immanent turning back, where the unity of the
whole ceases to be external and indifferent.
- The understanding's relation of whole and parts is thoughtless, while the
relation of force is higher and immanent.
- Force is a reflection into itself and its opposite; it reflects immediate
subsistence as well as negates itself.
- Force is the unity of reflected and immediate subsistence, the contact of
sides where one side is insofar as the other is not.
- Force is self-repelling contradiction, active, and self-referring negative
unity. It is a positing act that only negatively refers to itself.
- Force contains immediate concrete existence as a transient and
self-sublating moment, not as a concretely existing thing.
- The stimulus for one force is another force, not an external thing. The
forces are self-subsistent and reciprocally soliciting.
- Force is conditioned through itself as another force, and each force
contains the unity reflected into itself as sublated. They refer to each other
essentially.
- The concept of force is the identity of positing and presupposing
reflection, each being mediated through the other.
- Each force is both soliciting and being solicited, forming an essential
unity of the two.
- Force is not finite; its moments still have the form of immediacy.
- Force's activity consists in expressing itself, sublating externality, and
determining it as identical with itself.
- Force expresses that its reference to another is a reference to itself, that
its passivity is its activity.

**Commentary:** Hegel explores the concept of force as a more developed and
intricate relation compared to the earlier relation of whole and parts. Force
is dynamic, containing self-subsistence, reflection, and a complex interaction
with other forces. It embodies a unity of self and other, activity and
passivity, and external stimulus and self-reflection. This section marks an
important transition in Hegel's dialectical development, as he moves from
discussing external relations of objects to more dynamic and self-referential
processes.
In this section, Hegel explores the **Relation of Outer and Inner** and its
implications for the concept of force:

**Relation of Outer and Inner:**

1. The relation of whole and parts is immediate, but in the essential
relation, self-subsistence becomes a negative unity, posited in the expression
of force. The difference between self-subsisting forces sublates itself; the
expression of force is a mediation of reflected unity with itself. The unity
is a reflective shine, an empty difference. The inner and outer are different
form determinations with an identical substrate.

2. Inner and outer are determinations of reflection, each being for itself.
They are in reality one identity that transitions between them. The inner is
immediate outer, and vice versa. They are both posited only in the determinacy
of form, and their unity is a simple point empty of content.

3. The identity of inner and outer is the substrate/content, while the
unmediated identity is the conversion of each into its opposite, or pure form.
These identities are sides of a totality. Each is posited as a totality within
itself through its other, and the totality mediates itself through the form
and determinateness.

**Implications for Force:**

- Hegel relates the inner and outer to the concept of force. The inner is
immediate identity, essence, and being, while the outer is manifold,
determined being, and external. Each side transitions into the other as their
immediate identity, mediated through the totality of the relation.

- The appearance of something is the expression of its inner essence. Its
content and form are identical, and it is essentially self-revealing. This
self-revealing essence is what Hegel refers to as "actuality."

**Commentary:**

Hegel continues to explore the intricacies of relations and the development of
concepts through dialectical processes. The transition from whole and parts to
outer and inner introduces more complex notions of identity, form, and
content. Hegel's discussion highlights the dynamic nature of concepts and the
interconnectedness of various aspects of thought.

C. ACTUALITY

In this section on **Actuality**, Hegel further elaborates on the concept of
actuality and its significance within his dialectical framework:

**Actuality:**

- Actuality is the unity of essence and concrete existence. It encompasses
both the shapeless essence and unstable appearance, providing truth to both.
Concrete existence, although stemming from the ground, lacks explicit form
within itself. It is appearance when it determines and informs itself,
transitioning from reflection-into-other to immanent reflection.

- Within actuality, there are two worlds or totalities of content. One is
determined as reflected into itself, and the other as reflected into other.
The essential relation exposes the formality of their connection. The
consummation of their connection is the relation of inner and outer, where
their content is one identical substrate and one identity of form.

- The unity of inner and outer, as realized in actuality, represents absolute
actuality. This actuality has multiple dimensions:
  1. It represents the absolute as such, where form has sublated itself,
creating an external distinction between outer and inner. External reflection
contemplates the absolute without being its own movement. However, this
movement is essential and constitutes the negative turning back of the
absolute into itself.
  2. Actuality is proper actuality. It, along with possibility and necessity,
constitutes the formal moments of the absolute, reflecting its nature.
  3. The unity of the absolute and its reflection signifies the absolute
relation or substance â€“ the absolute as a relation to itself.

**Commentary:**

Hegel's exploration of actuality delves into the convergence of essence and
concrete existence, reflecting on how these aspects come together to create a
unified reality. The concept of actuality serves as a crucial point where the
dialectical process reaches a culmination. Hegel's intricate analysis leads to
a deeper understanding of the dynamic interplay between different layers of
reality, thought, and form. The exploration of actuality continues the journey
through the complex realm of dialectical philosophy.

CHAPTER 1

The absolute

IV.21
citer apratisankramaya tad-akara-apattau svabuddhi-samvedanam

This section continues the exploration of the absolute, discussing its nature,
attributes, and mode of existence:

**A. THE EXPOSITION OF THE ABSOLUTE:**

- The absolute is not merely being or essence. It transcends these concepts
and is the absolute unity of being and essence, inner and outer.

- The absolute's identity is that of absolute form. It is not abstract
identity but the identity of inner and outer, reflecting and shining within
itself. The absolute's identity holds all determinations, making it absolute
content.

Certainly! The section you're referring to, "A. Exposition of the Absolute," is a crucial part of Hegel's Doctrine of Essence in the Science of Logic. In this section, Hegel explores the concept of the Absolute and its relation to various categories of Essence. Let's break down the text step by step:

**1. Essence as Reflection into Self:**
Hegel begins by stating that in Essence, the immediate unity of Being and Non-Being in Becoming is superseded. This supersession is the movement of reflection into self. Here, reflection is crucial because it represents a higher level of self-awareness, where the subject examines itself and its own nature.

**2. Reflection as Essential Relation:**
Essence is revealed as the essential relation itself. This means that Essence is not merely an abstraction or a concept; it is the inherent connection between different aspects of reality. Essence is the way things relate to each other in their essential nature.

**3. The Disjunctive Substrate:**
Hegel introduces the term "disjunctive substrate." This refers to the underlying unity that exists within seemingly opposite or contradictory aspects. The disjunctive substrate is a key concept in Hegel's philosophy, as it highlights that even in the midst of opposition, there is an underlying unity or connection.

**4. Essence as Notion:**
Essence is also the notion (or concept) itself. It's important to note that in Hegel's philosophy, "notion" refers to a higher level of understanding that goes beyond mere immediate appearances. The notion encompasses the full depth and complexity of a concept, including its inner contradictions and relational aspects.

**5. Identity of Essence and Existence:**
Hegel emphasizes that the notion is the unity of being and essence. This means that the true nature of something is not separated from its existence; rather, they are intertwined. The notion is the realization that what something is (essence) is inseparable from how it manifests (existence).

**6. The Truth of Being and Essence:**
Hegel then moves to an important point: the truth of Being and Essence is the Concept. The Concept represents the highest level of understanding, where the full complexity and interconnectedness of a subject are grasped. It's the culmination of the dialectical process that moves through Being and Essence.

**7. Essence as Truth of Being:**
In this step, Hegel reiterates that Essence is the truth of Being. This means that the deeper understanding of what something is (essence) is the true reality, going beyond the surface appearances of Being.

**8. Necessity of the Concept:**
Hegel concludes the section by emphasizing that the Concept is necessary to reconcile the contradictions between Being and Essence. The Concept is what unites and integrates the two aspects into a comprehensive and coherent whole.

In summary, this section explores the transition from Being to Essence, highlighting the importance of reflection, the disjunctive substrate, and the notion (or concept) in understanding the nature of reality. It underscores the interconnectedness of Being, Essence, and the Concept as integral components of Hegel's philosophical system.

**B. THE ABSOLUTE ATTRIBUTE:**

- The absolute is both absolute identity and absolute attribute. The attribute
is the relative absolute, which signifies the absolute in a form
determination. Attributes are the totality that is posited as true and single
subsistence, while the determination within them is unessential subsistence.

- The attribute contains the absolute for its content and subsistence. Its
form determination by which it is an attribute is a reflective shine, a mere
way and manner.
Of course! In the section "B. The Absolute Attribute" from Hegel's Doctrine of Essence in the Science of Logic, Hegel continues to explore the concept of the Absolute and its attributes. Let's break down the text step by step:

**1. The Absolute Attribute as the Unity of Being and Essence:**
Hegel begins by stating that the Absolute Attribute is the unity of Being and Essence. This means that the Absolute encompasses both the immediate existence of something (Being) and its underlying essential nature (Essence). The Absolute Attribute is the synthesis of these two aspects.

**2. Negation and Determination in the Absolute:**
Hegel introduces the concepts of negation and determination within the Absolute. Negation signifies the removal or absence of something, while determination refers to specifying or defining a particular aspect. In the Absolute, negation and determination work together to define and shape the attributes of reality.

**3. The Contradictory Nature of Determination:**
Hegel points out that determination itself contains a contradictory nature. On one hand, determination specifies and defines something, but on the other hand, it limits and negates other possibilities. This inherent contradiction within determination is a reflection of the dynamic nature of reality.

**4. Determination and Essence:**
Hegel emphasizes that determination is an essential attribute of the Absolute. This attribute is closely related to Essence, as Essence involves the deeper, essential characteristics that define a subject. Determination is how these essential characteristics become manifest and distinct.

**5. Relation between Determination and Negation:**
Hegel explores the relationship between determination and negation further. He points out that determination negates certain possibilities while simultaneously affirming a specific aspect. This interplay between negation and determination creates the complex network of attributes within the Absolute.

**6. Dialectical Movement within Determination:**
Hegel highlights the dialectical movement present within determination. As determination negates certain possibilities, it simultaneously opens up new determinations and attributes. This dialectical movement is an essential feature of the Absolute and contributes to its dynamic nature.

**7. The Unity of Determination and Negation:**
Hegel asserts that the unity of determination and negation is the Absolute itself. This means that the contradictory interplay between determination (affirmation) and negation (negation of alternatives) is the very essence of the Absolute.

**8. The True Meaning of the Absolute:**
Hegel concludes the section by noting that the true meaning of the Absolute lies in its determination and negation. The Absolute Attribute is not an abstract concept but is grounded in the dynamic process of determination and the inherent contradictions it entails.

In summary, this section delves into the nature of the Absolute Attribute, focusing on the interplay between determination and negation. It highlights how these attributes define the essence of the Absolute and contribute to its complexity and dynamic character. The dialectical movement within determination and negation is essential to understanding the nature of reality according to Hegel's philosophical system.

IV.23

**C. THE MODE OF THE ABSOLUTE:**

- The mode of the absolute is a self-identity that shines as reflective shine.
It is the immanent turning back of reflective movement, self-dissolving
reflection. The mode is the absolute's own reflective movement.

- The content of the absolute is the manifestation of itself. The distinction
between form and content within the absolute dissolves, making the content the
manifestation itself.

- The absolute is expression, a manifestation of itself for itself, and it is
actuality.

In this section, Hegel discusses how the absolute embodies its own form and
content, reflecting the intricate interplay between identity, attributes, and
manifestation. The absolute is not a static concept but a dynamic process of
self-manifestation and self-realization. The exposition provided by Hegel
delves into the philosophical nature of the absolute and its various aspects,
aiming to convey the depth and complexity of this concept within his
philosophical system.

Certainly! In the section "C. The Mode of the Absolute" from Hegel's Doctrine of Essence in the Science of Logic, Hegel explores the concept of the Absolute in terms of its mode or manner of existence. Let's break down the text step by step:

**1. The Absolute's Mode of Being:**
Hegel begins by discussing the mode or manner of the Absolute's being. He emphasizes that the Absolute is not only a content or substance but also a mode of existence. This mode of being is described as "concrete universality," indicating that the Absolute encompasses both the universal and the particular in a unified manner.

**2. The Universal and the Particular:**
Hegel highlights the inherent connection between the universal and the particular within the Absolute. He states that the Absolute's mode of being involves the unity of the universal and the particular, where the two are not separate but are intertwined.

**3. The Absolute's Dialectical Nature:**
Hegel points out that the Absolute's mode of being is dialectical in nature. This means that the universal and the particular are in constant interaction and movement. The dialectical process involves negation, contradiction, and reconciliation, leading to the dynamic development of the Absolute's mode of existence.

**4. The Absolute as Concrete Universality:**
Hegel introduces the concept of "concrete universality" as a key characteristic of the Absolute's mode of being. Concrete universality refers to the unity of the universal and the particular within a specific context. It implies that the Absolute's existence is not abstract or detached but is embedded in the richness of reality.

**5. The Relationship between Form and Content:**
Hegel discusses the relationship between form and content within the context of the Absolute's mode of being. He suggests that form and content are inseparable within the Absolute, with form being the external manifestation of the content's inherent nature.

**6. The Necessity of Form for Content:**
Hegel asserts that form is necessary for content to be realized and expressed. Without an appropriate form, the content remains concealed and unactualized. Form provides the structure and framework through which content becomes intelligible and accessible.

**7. The Actuality of the Absolute:**
Hegel explains that the Absolute's mode of being is actuality. Actuality refers to the concrete existence of something as opposed to its mere potentiality. The Absolute's actuality encompasses both form and content, universal and particular, in a harmonious unity.

**8. The Triadic Nature of Actuality:**
Hegel describes actuality as a triadic structure consisting of form, content, and their unity. This triadic structure is an expression of the dialectical process that characterizes the Absolute's mode of being.

**9. The Concrete Universal as Absolute Necessity:**
Hegel concludes the section by stating that the concrete universal, which is the Absolute's mode of being, is also the realm of absolute necessity. The necessity lies in the inherent connection between form and content, universal and particular, within the concrete universal.

In summary, this section explores the mode of the Absolute's existence, emphasizing its concrete universality, dialectical nature, and the relationship between form and content. The Absolute's actuality is depicted as a triadic structure that integrates various aspects into a unified whole. This understanding of the Absolute's mode of being sheds light on its dynamic and interconnected nature within Hegel's philosophical framework.

IV.27
hanam esam klesavad uktam

This chapter delves into the concept of actuality, possibility, and necessity
within Hegel's philosophical framework:

**A. CONTINGENCY OR FORMAL ACTUALITY, POSSIBILITY, AND NECESSITY:**

1. **Actuality and Possibility:**
   - Actuality is the immediate, unreflected form of existence. It is the
first actuality and is a mere being or concrete existence in general.
   - However, actuality is also the unity of itself and possibility. What is
actual is possible.

2. **Possibility and Reflection:**
   - Possibility is reflected actuality, posited as a unity with actuality. It
is the in-itself determined as sublated or as an otherness.
   - Possibility is two-fold: positively, it's a being reflected into itself;
negatively, it points to an other and is thus deficient. It contains
contradiction internally.

3. **Contingency:**
   - The unity of possibility and actuality is contingency. The contingent is
an actuality that is simultaneously determined as only possible.
   - The contingent is both immediate actuality (concrete existence) and also
a form of possibility. It does not have a proper ground.

**B. NECESSITY:**

- Necessity emerges from contingency due to the restlessness of these
determinations. Each determination turns into its opposite, creating an
identity of each in the other.

- The necessary is immediate, groundless actuality that has its actuality
through an other or in its ground. It is the positedness of this ground and
its reflection into itself.

- What is necessary exists and is itself necessary. It is in itself, and this
immanent reflection is distinct from the immediacy of being.

- The necessary is not the same as the existent; it is itself only
positedness, sublated and immediate. Thus, the actuality that distinguishes
itself from possibility is identical with itself in necessity.

Hegel's exploration in this chapter elucidates the intricate relationship
between actuality, possibility, and necessity, revealing how they interplay
within his philosophical framework. The movement from contingency to necessity
demonstrates the dialectical nature of these concepts as they evolve and
transform in relation to one another.

tata-krta-arthanam parinama-krama-samapti gunanam

In this section, Hegel continues to explore the relationship between
actuality, possibility, and necessity. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**B. RELATIVE NECESSITY OR REAL ACTUALITY, POSSIBILITY, AND NECESSITY:**

1. **Real Actuality:**
   - Real actuality is a concrete existence that maintains itself within the
manifoldness of mere concrete existence.
   - It possesses inner reflection and relation to an other while preserving
itself.
   - It is a self-subsistent with immanent reflection.

2. **Real Possibility:**
   - Real possibility is immediate concrete existence and encompasses the
circumstances that refer to a fact.
   - It is not just a formal possibility but considers the real conditions and
circumstances.
   - Real possibility constitutes the totality of conditions, creating a
dispersed actuality that is intended to return to itself.

3. **Real Necessity:**
   - Real necessity emerges from self-sublating real possibility.
   - Real necessity is self-identity and is characterized by the fact that
what is necessary cannot be otherwise.
   - It is an identity of form and content, indifferent to form, and contains
real content.
   - Real necessity starts from the contingent and presupposes its movement.

4. **Relative Necessity and Contingency:**
   - Real necessity is relative because it starts from the contingent and
presupposes a movement.
   - Real necessity contains both contingency and necessity.
   - It is a limited actuality with a contingent content, thus embodying both
necessity and contingency.
   - Real necessity contains both necessity and contingency and can be
referred to as absolute actuality.

Hegel's exploration here highlights the complex interplay between necessity
and contingency, and how these concepts are intricately related within his
philosophical system. The concepts of real actuality, possibility, and
necessity are shown to be intertwined in a way that reflects the dynamic
nature of Hegel's dialectical approach.

IV.32
ksana-pratiyogi parinama-aparanta-nirgrahya krama

In this section, Hegel delves into the concept of absolute necessity, which
represents the culmination of his exploration of necessity, actuality, and
possibility. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**C. ABSOLUTE NECESSITY:**

1. **Determinate Necessity and Contingency:**
   - Real necessity contains contingency within it. The determinateness of
necessity lies in having its negation (contingency) within it.
   - Determinate necessity is immediate actual necessity, where actuality and
necessity are united.

2. **Absolute Actuality and Possibility:**
   - Absolute actuality is characterized by being itself necessary, with its
in-itself being necessity rather than possibility.
   - However, because absolute actuality posits itself as absolute unity of
itself and possibility, it becomes an empty determination, a mere contingency.

3. **Absolute Necessity's Becoming:**
   - Absolute necessity is a result of the self-sublation of actuality into
possibility and possibility into actuality.
   - This self-sublation is a continuous movement where necessity determines
itself as contingency and vice versa.
   - This movement is the positing of immediacy and in-itself, making
necessity both contingency and necessity.

4. **The Unity of Being and Essence:**
   - Absolute necessity is the unity of being and essence, reflecting both
simple immediacy (being) and pure essence.
   - It is a unity without condition or ground, existing because it is.
   - It reflects both being and essence and has only itself as its ground and
condition.

5. **The Breakthrough of Essence:**
   - The essence of absolute necessity breaks forth within it as absolute
negativity.
   - The simplicity of being, resting on itself, reveals itself as absolute
negativity, manifesting the freedom of its reflectionless immediacy.
   - This negative aspect breaks forth as their nothingness, challenging their
inherent being.

6. **Substance and Identity:**
   - The blind transition of necessity is the absolute's own exposition,
revealing its movement in itself.
   - This unity in its negation is substance, representing the identity of
being with itself.
   - This substance is a relation to itself, and it is this unity in its
negation that is substance.

Hegel's exploration culminates in the concept of absolute necessity, where
necessity, actuality, and possibility converge. The complex interplay between
these concepts reflects the intricacies of Hegel's dialectical philosophy,
where ideas evolve and transform in a dynamic process of self-realization and
self-negation.

IV.33
purusa-artha-sunyanam gunanam pratiprasava kaivalyam
svarupa-pratistha va citi-sakti iti

In this section, Hegel introduces the concept of the "absolute relation,"
which further explores the nature of necessity, actuality, and possibility.
Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**CHAPTER 3: The Absolute Relation**

1. **Nature of Absolute Necessity:**
   - Absolute necessity is not merely "necessary" or "a necessary," but it is
necessity itself, being reflected upon.
   - It is a form of relation, as it involves a distinction whose moments
constitute the entire totality of necessity.
   - The subsistence of these moments is an interconnected whole, where their
difference is the reflective manifestation of the movement of exposition, and
this reflection is the absolute itself.
   - Just as the light of nature is not a separate entity but is its own
shining, manifestation is self-identical absolute actuality.

2. **Attributes vs. Absolute Relation:**
   - In attributes, the absolute shines reflectively only in one of its
moments, assumed by external reflection.
   - The expositor of the absolute is the absolute necessity, which, as
self-determining, is identical with itself.
   - The sides of this relation, being reflective shining, are totalities.
Their differences are themselves and their opposites, constituting the whole.

3. **Immediate Concept of the Absolute Relation:**
   - The immediate concept of the absolute relation is reminiscent of the
relation between substance and accidents.
   - It involves the internal disappearance and becoming of the absolute
reflective shine.
   - When substance determines itself as being-for-itself in relation to an
other, or as absolute relation in reality, it forms a relation of causality.

4. **Causality and Reciprocal Causality:**
   - When the relation of causality evolves into reciprocal causality,
referring to itself, it represents the absolute relation posited according to
its inherent determination.
   - This posited unity of itself within its determinations, which are posited
as the whole itself and thus as determinations, leads to the emergence of the
concept.

Hegel's exploration of the absolute relation emphasizes the interconnectedness
of necessity, actuality, and possibility, as well as the self-referential
nature of reflection. Through these concepts, Hegel aims to uncover the
fundamental nature of reality and how it evolves through dialectical processes.
In this section, Hegel delves into the concept of substantiality and explores
how absolute necessity manifests itself through substance and accidents.
Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**A. THE RELATION OF SUBSTANTIALITY**

1. **Nature of Substance and Accidents:**
   - Absolute necessity is absolute relation, not mere being, but being that
is mediated with itself.
   - Substance is the final unity of essence and being, embodying both being
and reflection within itself.
   - Substance is not an abstract concept standing behind concrete existence;
it is immediate actuality that exists in and for itself.
   - Substance is the unity of form and content, being and reflection, and it
shines as a self-referring existence.
   - The unity of substance and reflection is both the shining and the
positedness of itself.

2. **Shining and Identity:**
   - The reflective shine is identity as the unity of possibility and
actuality.
   - Accidentality involves coming-to-be and passing-away, and it exhibits the
reflective shine of being and reflective determinations.
   - The reflective determinations include immediate something with content,
quality as indifferent diversity, and immanent reflection.
   - Immanent reflection leads to necessary actuality, and the movement of
accidentality is the actuality of substance's self-manifestation.

3. **Substance's Creative and Destructive Power:**
   - Substance manifests itself through actuality and possibility, acting as
creative and destructive power.
   - The negative and positive, possibility and negativity, are united in
substantial necessity.
   - The unity of form and content, and the interplay between possibility and
actuality, cause one accident to drive out another, forming a continuous cycle.

4. **Differentiation of Substance and Accidents:**
   - Immediate identity and presence of substance in accidents result in a
lack of real difference.
   - Substance's differentiation from itself as totality of accidents is
mediated by power and necessity.
   - Necessity is the positive persistence of accidents in their negativity,
and it mediates the relation between substance and accidents.

5. **Substantiality and Accidentality:**
   - Substantiality refers to itself as a positive unity, manifesting itself
through formal power and the accidents.
   - Substance is the inner reality of accidents, while accidents are the
existence of substance.
   - The relation of substantiality leads to the relation of causality, as
substance's power and necessity mediate the differences between them.

Hegel's exploration of substantiality and accidents highlights the interplay
between being, reflection, and their manifestations. Substance is presented as
a self-referring unity that embodies both creative and destructive power,
while accidents form a dynamic interplay within the context of necessity and
reflection. The development of these concepts contributes to Hegel's overall
philosophical framework.

Certainly, I'd be happy to help break down the argument and provide a detailed
commentary for each step. The text seems quite complex, so I'll do my best to
simplify and clarify the concepts presented. Please note that due to the
intricate nature of the text, my explanation might still be quite dense, but
I'll aim to make it as clear as possible.

**Section: B. The Relation of Causality**

**1. Formal Causality**

**a. Formal Causality: Cause and Effect**

**1. Cause is Originative as Against the Effect**

The text begins by introducing the concept of "substance" as power that
reflects into itself. This power has the ability to posit determinations and
differentiate them from itself. The initial discussion centers on cause and
effect. A cause is described as the originator or initiator of an action or
event, while an effect is the outcome or consequence of that action.

**2. Cause is Reflective Shine of Substance**

Substance, as power, not only causes effects but also has an inherent
reflective quality. This means that substance's power involves both an active,
originating aspect (cause) and a reflective, self-determining aspect. This
reflective aspect is significant because it leads to the manifestation of
transitions and determinations.

**b. The Determinate Relation of Causality**

**1. Identity of Cause and Effect in the Passive Substance**

The text delves into the determinate relation of causality, where cause and
effect are interrelated. It's explained that cause and effect are not separate
entities, but rather manifestations within a substrate called "passive
substance." The passive substance is both a result of causality and a
reflection of it. This reflection highlights that causality, which previously
seemed distinct, becomes implicit within the substrate.

**2. Substance's Determination as Cause and Effect**

The discussion continues by clarifying that the substrate (passive substance)
is also a substance with its own determinations. These determinations are both
the cause and the effect. In other words, the passive substance contains both
the cause and its corresponding effect within itself.

**3. Infinite Regress from Cause to Cause**

The text explores the concept of an infinite regress of causes and effects. It
explains that the finite nature of cause leads to the demand for another
cause, creating an unending sequence. This endless progression occurs because
cause and effect aren't fully reconciled within the finite realm; their
relationship is external.

**c. Action and Reaction**

**Action and Reaction: Passive and Active Substances**

The text introduces the concept of "action and reaction." It presents two key
substances: the passive substance and the active substance. The active
substance initiates action (cause) and interacts with the passive substance.
The passive substance, on the other hand, is impacted by the action and
transforms into a cause as well.

**Action and Reaction: Violence and Power**

The text discusses the dynamic between violence and power. Violence represents
external force, while power involves internal action. The concept of violence
signifies that a passive substance loses its immediacy and becomes a cause.
Power, on the other hand, is the active substance's ability to exert influence
and react.

**Action and Reaction: Preservation and Becoming**

The text highlights that the active substance preserves the passive substance
by sublating itself, causing the passive substance to become a cause.
Simultaneously, the passive substance's reaction is to rejoin itself, becoming
an originator (cause) as well. This dynamic shows that the interaction between
the two substances involves both preservation and becoming.

**Concluding Thoughts**

The text is a philosophical exploration of the intricate relationships between
causality, substance, and their interplay. It discusses how cause and effect
are interconnected, how passive substance becomes a cause, and how action and
reaction occur within this philosophical framework.

Keep in mind that the text is dense and abstract, making it open to various
interpretations. Philosophical texts often require multiple readings and
careful consideration to fully grasp the concepts being presented. If you have
specific questions about certain parts of the text or would like further
clarification on any aspect, feel free to ask.

**Section: C. RECIPROCITY OF ACTION**

In this section, the text delves into the concept of reciprocity of action and
how it relates to finite causality and the interplay of substances. It
discusses the transformation from finite causality to reciprocity of action
and explores the nature of necessity, causality, and freedom within this
context.

**Reciprocal Causality and Mechanism**

Reciprocity of action involves substances actively relating to each other in a
mechanistic manner. Mechanism, in this context, is about the external nature
of causality, where the reflection of cause in its effect becomes a repelling
force. This means that the causal substance not only reflects itself in the
effect but also becomes external to itself, and the effect is transposed into
another substance.

**Transformation of Reciprocity of Action**

Reciprocity of action goes through a transformation. First, the persistence of
immediate substantiality disappears. Second, the cause originates and mediates
itself through its own negation. This transformation involves a shift from
presupposed substances with reciprocal causality to a deeper understanding of
causality and its interplay.

**Passive and Active Substances**

Initially, in the form of reciprocal causality, substances are both active and
passive toward each other. This dual nature implies that their difference is
transparent, reflecting the identity of the active and the passive aspects.
The reciprocity of action, however, is still an empty concept, requiring the
external bringing together of existing elements.

**Transition to Substances**

Reciprocity of action moves from referring to substrates to referring to
substances. The immediacy of the substrates is sublated in the movement of
conditional causality, and what conditions the causing activity is only an
influence or its own passivity. This influence doesn't originate from another
substance but from a causality mediated through influence.

**Nature of Causality**

Causality is both conditioned and conditioning. It acts as both passive and
active. This conditioning or passivity is the negation of the cause through
itself, making itself essentially an effect and a cause simultaneously.
Reciprocity of action is, in essence, causality itself, where the cause refers
back to itself as the cause within the effect.

**Return to Absolute Concept of Causality**

Reciprocity of action brings causality back to its absolute concept while also
attaining the concept itself. It becomes real necessity, where the differences
within it are substances, representing free actualities. Necessity becomes
inner identity, and causality manifests it, eliminating reflective substantial
otherness and elevating necessity to freedom.

**Transition and Reflective Shine**

Reciprocity of action showcases origination from negation and passing away
into it, becoming a shining transition. This transition retains reflective
shine or positedness. The negation that grounds the cause becomes its positive
rejoining with itself.

**Disappearance of Necessity and Causality**

Within the reciprocity of action, both necessity and causality disappear. It
encompasses the immediate identity of combination and reference, as well as
the absolute substantiality of differences and their contingency. The unity of
substantial difference and absolute contradiction is revealed. Necessity, once
a form of being, is now only reflective shining, and causality transitions
from origin to reflective shine and vice versa.

**Differentiation and Unity**

Absolute substance no longer repels itself as necessity or falls into
contingency. Instead, it differentiates itself into universality (the whole
that contains positedness) and singularity (the negative determinateness). The
universal and the singular are actually the same negativity, just expressed
differently. The concept becomes a realm of subjectivity or freedom.

The text navigates complex philosophical notions, focusing on the
transformation from finite causality to reciprocity of action. It examines the
interplay of substances, causality, necessity, and freedom, culminating in the
concept of subjectivity. As with philosophical texts, multiple readings may be
necessary to fully grasp the intricate ideas presented.
