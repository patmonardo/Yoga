    "\n",
    "In the concept of being-for-itself, Hegel explores the culmination of qualitative being, presenting it as infinite being. This state represents a form of existence that transcends simple determinations. The initial stage of being is characterized by an absence of specific qualities - a kind of undefined or void state. However, as existence evolves, it moves beyond (or 'sublates') this initial form. This sublation is immediate, implying that it happens directly and inherently. Initially, this process encapsulates only the primary negation, which is immediate in itself. Yet, being persists within this transformation, merging with its negation in a simple, yet profound unity. Despite this unity, the elements of being and negation retain their distinct identities. They are inherently different, and their unity isn't fully actualized or explicitly acknowledged. This tension reflects a deeper philosophical insight into the nature of existence and its underlying dynamics.\n",

    "In Hegel's framework, 'the other' exists within a concept or entity only as a sublated element, a phase it has surpassed. The essence of being-for-itself lies in transcending such limitations and otherness. This transcending is akin to a perpetual self-referential cycle, a continual return to itself. When consciousness contemplates an external object—through feeling, intuition, or other forms—it inherently includes the nature of being-for-itself. This means that the object of its attention becomes part of its own content, an 'idealization' within its consciousness. Even as consciousness engages with what is outside or opposite to it (the negative, the other), it remains inherently self-contained. This reflects a profound aspect of consciousness: its ability to internalize and transform external stimuli while maintaining its self-identity.\n",

There is only a singular mode of existence, which is being-for-another, and because it exists solely as this being-for-another, it simultaneously becomes being-for-one.

It differs from a second type of repulsion, which is more readily perceived by external observation – not as the creation of 'ones' but as the reciprocal distancing of 'ones' that are assumed to already exist.
