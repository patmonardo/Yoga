He suggests that each moment, despite its specific characteristics, embodies the entirety of a concept or phenomenon. This is because each moment not only possesses its own unique attributes but also inherently includes aspects of its opposite or 'other' moment. However, this 'other' aspect exists indifferently within it. Therefore, each moment contains within itself a hint of its own non-existence or opposite. Hegel asserts that a moment is a complete or whole entity only when it fundamentally acknowledges its non-being.

    "\"Hegel explains that the concepts of 'positive' and 'negative' can be understood as self-sustaining or independent aspects of opposition. They achieve this self-sustaining nature because they represent the reflection of the whole concept or entity into itself. In other words, the positive and the negative are not just opposing sides; they are integral parts of the whole that gain their own identity through this process of self-reflection. Hegel ties this to the idea of opposition as a form of determinateness – a specific, defining quality of something – that, as a whole, reflects into itself. Simply put, in Hegel's view, the positive and negative are both separate and integral parts of a larger whole, each sustaining itself by reflecting the entirety of that whole within itself. This reflects the dialectical nature of concepts, where opposites are not just in conflict, but also define and sustain each other as part of a larger unified system.\"\n",

However, he also points out that in this framework, the state of being (or existence) becomes something indifferent or neutral ('indifferent subsistence'). Consequently, the aspect of non-being that each element contains is not just a fleeting moment but also a crucial part of its existence. Thus, for Hegel, the existence of each element is tied to the existence of its non-being, with both aspects in a constant, unified interaction.

    "Hegel explains that the concepts of 'positive' and 'negative' in opposition are not merely states of being positioned against each other (posited being) nor are they simply indifferent or neutral entities. Instead, he suggests that their 'positedness' – the aspect of each that refers to or is defined by the other within the unified whole they form – is actually absorbed back into each of them. This means that the positive and the negative each contain within themselves their relation to the other. In other words, the nature of the positive and negative includes their oppositional relationship, but this relationship is internalized within each one. Hegel is emphasizing that the positive and negative are not just externally related or indifferent entities; rather, they are dynamic and interconnected, with each one inherently containing and being shaped by its relationship to the other.\n",

Similarly, the negative is not merely negative because it contrasts with the positive; it possesses within itself the qualities that define its negativity.

    "\"In this passage, Hegel invites us to consider the two self-sustaining aspects of reflective determination: the positive and the negative, on their own terms. He focuses first on the nature of the 'positive.' The positive, according to Hegel, is an instance of 'positedness' that is reflected back onto itself. This means that it is defined not through its relationship to something else, but through its likeness or similarity to itself. In other words, the positive is a state of being that exists in its own right, without needing to refer to another entity for its definition. This self-referential nature gives the positive its subsistence or independent existence. However, there's a subtle complexity here: this independent existence or 'subsistence' is achieved precisely because the positive involves the negation or exclusion of anything that is not like itself. Thus, the positive is self-sustaining because it is both a self-affirmation and a simultaneous negation of the non-self.\"\n",

This act of defining itself against what it is not is where the contradiction lies. The positive, in its effort to establish self-identity, does so by excluding the negative. However, in this very act of exclusion, the positive inadvertently adopts the characteristics of the negative. It becomes, in a sense, a negation, because it defines itself in opposition to the negative.

He explains that when something (the positive) excludes its other, this other is simultaneously posited as free and independent of the entity doing the excluding. In essence, by the act of excluding, the positive inadvertently establishes the other as a self-reflective entity, one that is defined by its own nature and not merely by being excluded. Thus, the act of exclusion by the positive is, paradoxically, also an act of establishing or positing the other. Consequently, this process of exclusion becomes a two-fold act: it is not only the positive defining itself by excluding the other, but also, at the same time, it is the positive inadvertently establishing the other as an independent entity. The twist here, according to Hegel, is that this act of positing the other immediately becomes the act of the other excluding the positive.

In simpler terms, the negative defines itself by being the opposite of, or different from, the positive.

However, Hegel introduces a nuanced perspective here: he suggests that this quality of being unlike, or this state of non-being, actually brings the negative back to a reference to itself. In other words, in being unlike something else (the positive), the negative is not just negating or opposing the other; it is also, in a deeper sense, referring to and defining itself.

This means that negation is not just a standalone quality; it gains its full meaning only when seen in relation to something it negates. In other words, the true essence of negation lies in this relational aspect, where it is always connected to, and defined by, its opposition to something else, its 'other.'

Hegel points out that this leads to an intriguing phenomenon: due to its nature of excluding or negating identity, the negative ends up excluding itself from itself. In other words, the negative, in the act of defining itself against identity, paradoxically negates its own self-identity. This act of self-exclusion is a fundamental aspect of the negative’s nature. It embodies a contradiction where the negative, in affirming its nature as a negation of identity, essentially negates its own self-coherence.

In being so, the negative, as opposition, actively excludes any form of identity from itself. Yet, in this very act of exclusion, the negative also excludes itself. This occurs because, in referencing itself (being self-referential), the negative defines itself as the very identity it seeks to exclude. Therefore, Hegel illustrates a profound paradox: the negative, in its effort to be a complete opposition and exclude identity, ends up including identity within itself by the very nature of its self-reference.

This dynamic results in a perpetual vanishing of the opposites; they ceaselessly negate each other. From this ongoing process of mutual negation and transformation, a new state emerges, which Hegel identifies as the 'first unity.' This unity, born out of the inherent contradiction and its resolution, is what Hegel refers to as the 'null.' The 'null' represents the outcome of this continuous dialectical process, where the contradiction inherent in the positive and negative resolves itself into a unified state that transcends the original opposites.

However, these sides are still opposites; they are defined in relation to each other. Their self-subsistence is, therefore, something they possess 'in themselves'—it's an internal characteristic, not yet fully realized externally because of their oppositional nature. The fact that these opposites are self-subsistent 'in themselves' is what constitutes their 'positedness.' In Hegelian terms, positedness refers to the state of being established or defined within a particular context. Thus, Hegel is illustrating that while the opposites in an immanent reflection possess an inherent self-subsistence, this very nature of being self-subsistent within themselves is what defines their position or status in the broader dialectical process.

However, this act of self-establishment or positedness carries within it the seeds of its own undoing. Hegel explains that in defining themselves as self-identical (consistent and unified within themselves), these entities ironically embody negation. Their self-identity, which is supposed to affirm their independent existence, paradoxically becomes a form of 'reference-to-other.' This means that their self-identity is intrinsically linked to something outside of themselves, leading to a contradiction. The self-subsistent entities, in trying to maintain self-identity, actually engage in a process that undercuts it, because their identity is not purely self-contained but is defined in relation to others.

The act of negating the other (sublating the positedness) is what allows each entity to emerge as a unified and self-subsistent being. This unity, which exists for itself, is a result of the excluding reflection process. It's a state where the entities transcend their initial positedness and achieve a form of independent existence. Thus, Hegel reveals that the excluding reflection, far from being a mere formal act, is a crucial process that enables entities to establish their own self-subsistence by transcending their initial state of opposition and negation.\"\n",

He explains that, indeed, through the act of sublating otherness, a form of positedness or negation of another entity re-emerges. However, Hegel clarifies that this re-emergence of negation is not merely a regression to the initial, immediate state of opposition to the other. It’s not simply about returning to a state where each entity is defined in direct contrast to the other (which he terms 'immediate reference'). Rather, the nature of this new positedness is more complex. It is positedness that has itself been sublated. In other words, it is a negation that has transcended its own initial form. This transformed positedness, then, is not just a simple negation of another entity; it is a more evolved state, having incorporated and transcended its initial immediacy.

In essence, the act of excluding (which defines the reflection as posited) inherently contains the process of transcending its own posited state.

Secondly, this reflection then establishes itself as a negative entity. It becomes what it just negated, a new form of negation. However, Hegel notes that it is precisely this newly posited negative that the reflection then works to sublate. In this way, the process of sublating the negative involves both positing and negating it simultaneously. The act of overcoming the negative is also an act of affirming it. This dual action — where the reflection both establishes and negates the negative in one continuous movement — illustrates the complex and dynamic nature of dialectical processes.

Through the process of 'sublation' — a Hegelian concept involving the transcendence and integration of contradictions — these self-contradictory determinations are overcome. As a result, essence is restored, but it is restored as a new form: a reflective unity that is exclusive in nature. This unity is 'simple,' meaning it is undivided and fundamental, yet it actively determines itself through negation. In other words, this unity defines itself by what it is not. However, in this act of defining itself as a negation, it immediately aligns with itself — it becomes 'like itself' and is withdrawn or turned inward. This inward turning signifies a return to a state of self-consistency and harmony, where the essence, despite being defined through negation, finds a congruence with its own nature.

    "\"In this portion of his work, Hegel analyzes the dynamic where self-subsisting opposition, due to its inherent contradiction, reverts back to what he calls a 'ground.' He explains that this opposition is the initial, immediate state from which philosophical inquiry begins. It is the starting point, the 'given' from which the process of dialectical reasoning unfolds. However, because of the contradiction inherent in this opposition, it cannot sustain itself indefinitely. It is compelled to transform and go back into a more fundamental state, the 'ground.' This ground is not merely a static backdrop; it is an evolved state, born from the sublation (overcoming and integrating) of the opposition. The sublated opposition, or the transcendence of its positedness, becomes a new form of positedness. Hence, in Hegel's terms, essence, when understood as ground, is itself a form of positedness. It is not an unchanging, eternal foundation but something that has emerged, evolved, or 'become.' Essence as ground, therefore, signifies a developed state that has arisen from the dialectical resolution of contradictions inherent in the initial opposition.\"\n",

However, this excluded aspect, this positedness, exists only in its state of being posited. It is an identity of negation, where the essence, by negating a part of itself, establishes its identity. In other words, the essence, as ground, defines itself by differentiating within itself, creating a distinction that is integral to its nature.

In essence, Hegel is illustrating that the negative, while posited as an independent entity, is inextricably linked to and dependent on the deeper, underlying essence.

He explains that in opposition, the quality of being determinate — having a defined, distinct nature — advances to a state of self-subsistence. This means that in the dynamic of opposition, the characteristics of entities become more defined and capable of standing on their own.

Within this ground, the negative aspect is not just present; it exists as an integral part of the essence, but specifically as a negative. Moreover, in this state, the ground embodies both the negative and the positive. The negative, while maintaining its distinct nature, contributes to the formation of a self-identical essence. Therefore, ground, in Hegel's philosophy, is a synthesis where the negative, in being self-subsistent and part of the essence, also affirms the positive.

He asserts that within the ground, the characteristics of opposition and its inherent contradiction are simultaneously removed and preserved. This means that when opposition and its contradictions are absorbed into the ground, they are not simply eradicated or dissolved. Instead, there is a nuanced process at play: the elements of opposition and contradiction are transcended, which means they are overcome and raised to a higher level of understanding or being. However, this transcendence doesn't lead to their complete disappearance. Rather, these elements are preserved within the ground in a transformed state. In Hegelian philosophy, this preservation is not a static retention; it's an integration into a more complex, unified essence.

In other words, while the ground maintains a positive self-identity, it also defines itself in relation to its own negative aspects. This dual process allows the ground to determine itself, to actively shape its own nature. By doing so, it transforms itself into a form of 'excluded positedness' — a state that is defined but also set apart from other entities. Interestingly, Hegel emphasizes that this positedness, this defined state of being, encompasses the whole self-subsisting essence. The essence, therefore, in its role as ground, is self-identical both in its negation and in its positive form. This means that the essence, as ground, embodies a complex unity where its positive identity and its negating aspects coexist and define each other.

He suggests that this opposition was in fact already a form of 'ground,' though it was not initially apparent as such. The key element that transforms this opposition into ground is the emergence of self-unity. This self-unity arises as each side of the opposition negates, or sublates, itself, effectively turning into its opposite. In this process of self-sublation, the opposition collapses or 'founders,' and in this foundering, it metaphorically 'sinks to the ground.' However, this collapse is not a mere dissolution; it is also a process of reuniting with itself. Thus, in this act of foundering — in its state of positedness or negation — the opposition paradoxically becomes the essence in its true form. It is through this dialectical process that the essence, which was previously entangled in self-contradiction, is now reflected into itself and achieves self-identity.
