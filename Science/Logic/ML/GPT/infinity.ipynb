Initially, the understanding distorts the simple unity of these two concepts. It continues this distortion in the case of their double unity, wherein the two are seen as unified yet distinct. In this double unity, the infinite is often conceptualized incorrectly.

Hegel argues that this view is flawed because it implies that any presence of determinateness or limitation within the infinite would degrade or corrupt its essence. This misunderstanding by the understanding fails to capture the true nature of the infinite, which, in Hegel’s view, inherently includes aspects of finitude within its conceptual framework.

He observes that for many, especially those he describes as 'uneducated in thought,' these abstract categories are more familiar and easily grasped. As a result, there's a tendency to rely on them excessively, even when discussing concepts that have moved beyond these basic categories into more complex and nuanced territory.\n",
