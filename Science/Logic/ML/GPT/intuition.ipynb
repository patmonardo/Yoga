However, paradoxically, it possesses these very limitations precisely because it is the 'ought.' The 'ought' and the entity's restriction are inseparable. An entity experiences limitation because negation is embedded in its very nature or determination. Moreover, this determination also signifies the overcoming (or sublation) of its restriction.
