In ceasing-to-be, being transitions into nothingness, yet this state of nothingness inherently contains its own contradiction: it is also a transition back into being, or coming-to-be. Conversely, in the process of coming-to-be, where nothing transforms into being, being simultaneously negates itself, leading back to nothingness, or ceasing-to-be. These processes don't nullify each other through external forces; rather, each process contains within itself the seed of its opposite. Each inherently and independently transforms into its counterpart, embodying within itself the essence of its own contradiction.\n",
