We are constructing a Topical Analysis and OWL Schema
for Hegel's Science of Logic.
We will create an Ontology for each Chapter.
Each Chapter consists of a Generic Top-level Idea followed
by three moments usually listed A., B., C.
We will create a Thread for each Chapter.
Each Thread will have five prompts.
The first prompt will ask for two Artifacts:
the Analysis and Schema for the Generic Idea of the Chapter
followed by three prompts for each moment A. , B. , C.
and then concluding with a Complete OWL Schema
that combines the prior four Schemas.
