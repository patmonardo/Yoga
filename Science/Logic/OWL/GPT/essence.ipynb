    "In the scientific understanding of the universe, the initial concept of the absolute is often rooted in the idea of mere existence or 'being'. However, this perspective evolves over time. Scientific thought cannot remain confined to just observing the diverse manifestations of existence or to the idea of 'pure being', which negates all finite attributes. There's an inherent necessity to engage in deeper reflection, recognizing that this state of 'pure being' is not just an absence of finite elements, but a refined abstraction. This abstraction results from a cognitive process that distills the immediate, observable existence into 'pure being'. Thus, the absolute, initially understood as 'being', is reinterpreted as 'essence', reflecting a more profound and comprehensive grasp of reality."

When we abstract and combine all these realities, the result is a kind of 'empty simplicity' — a generalized concept that lacks the specific, defining features of the individual realities. Consequently, this form of 'essence', when conceptualized as merely the sum of all realities, turns out to be more of an artificial construct, a product of cognitive abstraction, rather than an inherent, fundamental truth of the phenomena. This perspective challenges us to reconsider how we define and understand the essence of things in scientific terms, highlighting the tension between the concrete individual realities and the abstracted generalizations we derive from them."
