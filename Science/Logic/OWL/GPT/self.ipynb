    "**Chapter 3: Being-for-itself**\n",
    "\n",
    "In being-for-itself, qualitative being is brought to completion; it is infinite being; the being of the beginning is void of determination; existence is sublated but only immediately sublated being; it thus contains, to begin with, only the first negation, itself immediate; being is of course retained as well, and the two are united in existence in simple unity; for this reason, however, each is in itself still unlike the other, and their unity is still not posited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existence is therefore the sphere of differentiation, of dualism, the domain of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such; being which is relatively, not absolutely, determined. In being-for-itself, the distinction between being and determinateness, or negation, is posited and equalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality, otherness, limit, as well as reality, in-itselfness, ought, and so forth, are the incomplete configurations of negation in being which are still based on the differentiation of the two.

    "\n",
    "In being-for-itself, qualitative being is brought to completion; it is infinite being; the being of the beginning is void of determination; existence is sublated but only immediately sublated being; it thus contains, to begin with, only the first negation, itself immediate; being is of course retained as well, and the two are united in existence in simple unity; for this reason, however, each is in itself still unlike the other, and their unity is still not posited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existence is therefore the sphere of differentiation, of dualism, the domain of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such; being which is relatively, not absolutely, determined. In being-for-itself, the distinction between being and determinateness, or negation, is posited and equalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality, otherness, limit, as well as reality, in-itselfness, ought, and so forth, are the incomplete configurations of negation in being which are still based on the differentiation of the two. But since in finitude negation has passed over into infinity, in the posited negation of negation, negation is simple self-reference and in it, therefore, the equalization with being: absolutely determinate being.\n",

    "\n",
    "By extending the topical analysis and compiling the essential marks into an OWL schema, we enhance the structured and systematic representation of the concept of \"Being-for-itself\". This process captures the depth and complexity of Hegelian philosophy, providing a formalized framework for understanding and exploring these profound ideas. The schema facilitates a precise and detailed representation of the various topics and marks, supporting further analysis and integration into broader philosophical discussions."

    "\n",
    "**Chapter 3: Being-for-itself**\n",
    "\n",
    "In being-for-itself, qualitative being is brought to completion; it is infinite being; the being of the beginning is void of determination; existence is sublated but only immediately sublated being; it thus contains, to begin with, only the first negation, itself immediate; being is of course retained as well, and the two are united in existence in simple unity; for this reason, however, each is in itself still unlike the other, and their unity is still not posited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existence is therefore the sphere of differentiation, of dualism, the domain of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such; being which is relatively, not absolutely, determined. In being-for-itself, the distinction between being and determinateness, or negation, is posited and equalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality, otherness, limit, as well as reality, in-itselfness, ought, and so forth, are the incomplete configurations of negation in being which are still based on the differentiation of the two. But since in finitude negation has passed over into infinity, in the posited negation of negation, negation is simple self-reference and in it, therefore, the equalization with being: absolutely determinate being.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, being-for-itself is immediately an existent-for-itself, the one.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By extending the topical analysis and compiling the essential marks into an OWL schema, we enhance the structured and systematic representation of the concept of \"Being-for-itself\". This process captures the depth and complexity of Hegelian philosophy, providing a formalized framework for understanding and exploring these profound ideas. The schema facilitates a precise and detailed representation of the various topics and marks, supporting further analysis and integration into broader philosophical discussions."

    "\n",
    "**Chapter 3: Being-for-itself**\n",
    "\n",
    "In being-for-itself, qualitative being is brought to completion; it is infinite being; the being of the beginning is void of determination; existence is sublated but only immediately sublated being; it thus contains, to begin with, only the first negation, itself immediate; being is of course retained as well, and the two are united in existence in simple unity; for this reason, however, each is in itself still unlike the other, and their unity is still not posited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existence is therefore the sphere of differentiation, of dualism, the domain of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such; being which is relatively, not absolutely, determined. In being-for-itself, the distinction between being and determinateness, or negation, is posited and equalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality, otherness, limit, as well as reality, in-itselfness, ought, and so forth, are the incomplete configurations of negation in being which are still based on the differentiation of the two. But since in finitude negation has passed over into infinity, in the posited negation of negation, negation is simple self-reference and in it, therefore, the equalization with being: absolutely determinate being.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, being-for-itself is immediately an existent-for-itself, the one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the one passes over into a multiplicity of ones, repulsion or the otherness of the one which sublates itself into its ideality, attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we have the alternating determination of repulsion and attraction in which the two sink into a state of equilibrium; and quality, driven to a head in being-for-itself, passes over into quantity.\n",

    "\n",
    "This streamlined OWL schema captures the key elements of the genus \"Being-for-itself\" without over-complicating the representation. Each class and its properties reflect the core aspects of Hegel's philosophy, enabling further analysis and integration into broader philosophical discussions while maintaining manageability for practical use. This approach balances comprehensiveness with usability, making it suitable for interactive use and future API implementation."

    "\n",
    "1. **Integration of the Finite and Infinite**: The unification of the finite with the infinite within being-for-itself, framed as a process of idealization.\n",
    "2. **Absence of Negation as Limitation**: In being-for-itself, negation does not serve as a determinateness or a boundary.\n",
    "3. **Lack of Reference to External Existence**: Being-for-itself does not relate to or reference an existence outside of itself, underscoring its self-contained nature.\n",
    "4. **Transcendence of Finite Boundaries**: Being-for-itself transcends typical finite limitations, representing a higher state of existential unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 2**:\n",
    "\"Although this moment is now being designated as being-for-one, there is yet nothing at hand for which it would be; there is not the one of which it would be the moment. There is in fact nothing of the sort yet fixed in being-for-itself; that for which something (and there is no something here) would be, what the other side in general should be, is likewise a moment, itself only being-for-one, not yet a one.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ambiguity in Being-for-One**: The ambiguity in the state of 'being-for-one', where there is no specific 'one' for which this state exists.\n",
    "2. **Lack of Fixed Entities in Being-for-Itself**: The absence of fixed or defined entities within the framework of being-for-itself.\n",
    "3. **Transitional Phase of Conceptualization**: This stage represents a transitional phase in Hegel's dialectic, where concepts and entities are not yet fully formed or distinct.\n",
    "4. **Undefined Other Side**: The 'other side' or counterpart that is also in a state of 'being-for-one', lacking concrete individuality or distinctiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 3**:\n",
    "\"What we have before us, therefore, is still an undistinguishedness of two sides that may suggest themselves in the being-for-one; there is only one being-for-another, and since this is only one being-for-another, it is also only being-for-one; there is only the one ideality, of that for which or in which there should be a determination as moment, and of that which should be the moment in it.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Clarification of the Concept**: The emergence of the concept of 'being-for-itself', highlighting its development in the philosophical discourse.\n",
    "2. **Justification of Terminology**: The importance of aligning the expression 'being-for-itself' with its conceptual representation.\n",
    "3. **Link Between Expression and Concept**: The necessity of a deep connection between the term and the underlying philosophical concept.\n",
    "4. **Essence and Nuances**: The need for the term to capture the essence and subtleties of the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 2**:\n",
    "\"So indeed it appears to do. We say that something is for itself inasmuch as it sublates otherness, sublates its connection and community with other, has rejected them by abstracting from them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confirmation of Conceptual Appropriateness**: The term 'being-for-itself' appropriately represents the concept.\n",
    "2. **Definition of 'For Itself' through Sublation**: An entity or concept is defined as 'for itself' through the process of sublating or transcending its connections and communal aspects with others.\n",
    "3. **Abstraction and Independence**: The process of abstraction, where the entity distinguishes itself from others.\n",
    "4. **Overcoming and Retaining Otherness**: The dialectical process of sublation, where the entity overcomes its otherness but still retains certain elements of it.\n",

    "**Segment 3**:\n",
    "\"The other is in it only as something sublated, as its moment; being-for-itself consists in having thus transcended limitation, its otherness; it consists in being, as this negation, the infinite turning back into itself. In representing to itself an intended object which it feels, or intuits, and so forth, consciousness already contains in itself as consciousness the determination of being-for-itself; that is, it has in it the content of that object, which is thus an idealization; even as it intuits, or in general becomes involved in the negative of itself, in the other, it abides with itself.\"\n",

    "3. **Consciousness and Self-Referentiality**: Consciousness, in perceiving an external object, inherently exercises its nature of being-for-itself, integrating the external into its self-concept.\n",
    "4. **Idealization Within Consciousness**: The external object becomes an 'idealization' within consciousness, indicating a transformation of external reality within the self.\n",

    "3. **Internalization and Idealization**: Consciousness's ability to internalize and idealize external objects within itself.\n",
    "4. **Dualistic Interaction**: The dualistic interaction of consciousness with the external world, balancing external engagement with internal reflection.\n",

    "3. **Manifestation of Infinity**: Self-consciousness as a manifestation of infinity, albeit in an abstract sense.\n",

    "1. **Infinite Entities as Idealizations**: Concepts such as the self, spirit, or God are seen as idealizations due to their infinite nature.\n",
    "2. **Conflation of Being-for-Themselves and Being-for-One**: These infinite existences are not different from the state of being-for-one, indicating a deep interconnectedness.\n",
    "3. **Implications of Difference**: If these entities were different, they would then represent only a basic existence or being-for-another.\n",

    "### Summary of Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Referential Nature of 'The One'**: The one is a self-referential aspect of being-for-itself where its different moments have unified.\n",
    "2. **Convergence of Moments**: The convergence or coming together of the moments of being-for-itself within 'the one'.\n",
    "3. **Immediacy of Being-for-Itself**: The transformation of being-for-itself into a state of immediacy, making its moments tangible.\n",
    "4. **Materialization of Abstract Concepts**: The abstract moments of being-for-itself have materialized into concrete existences within 'the one'.\n",
    "5. **Defining Role of 'The One'**: The one is an active determiner, shaping its nature through self-referential negation.\n",
    "6. **Infinite Self-Determination**: The infinite aspect of 'the one’s' self-determination, implying a constant process of self-definition.\n",
    "7. **Active Aspect of Negation**: The active, shaping role of negation within 'the one', rather than a mere absence or void.\n",
    "8. **Continuous Self-Construction**: The one is engaged in a continuous process of self-construction and redefinition.\n",
    "9. **Impact of Immediacy on Distinctions**: The state of immediacy changes the nature of the distinctions within 'the one', giving them a more concrete form.\n",
    "10. **Transition from Moments to Existent Entities**: These distinctions, previously seen as transient moments of self-determination, are now recognized as independent existences.\n",
    "11. **Solidification of Abstract Components**: The transformation of abstract aspects of self-determination into tangible, separate entities.\n",
    "12. **Individualization of Distinctions**: These distinctions gain individualized existence, moving beyond their collective role in the self-determining process.\n",
    "13. **Transition from Ideality to Reality**: The shift of being-for-itself from an ideal state to a real one.\n",
    "14. **Nature of the New Reality**: This newfound reality is not just any reality but one that is markedly fixed and abstract, characterized as 'a one.'\n",
    "15. **Abstract Yet Concrete Manifestation**: The paradoxical nature of this reality, which is tangible yet retains a high degree of abstraction.\n",
    "16. **Fixedness and Distinction of 'A One'**: The one represents a specific type of reality, distinct in its fixed and abstract quality.\n",
    "17. **Unity of Being and Existence**: The union of being and existence within 'the one', as a key aspect of being-for-itself.\n",
    "18. **Amalgamation of Internal and External References**: The integration of both external and internal referencing in forming this unity.\n",
    "19. **Conflict Between Being and Negation**: The opposition between the determinateness of being and the process of infinite negation within self-determination.\n",
    "20. **Self-Contained Essence of 'The One'**: The essence of 'the one' is contained entirely within itself, making it distinct from the negation process.\n",
    "21. **Separation of Negation as a Distinct Entity**: Negation is positioned as a separate entity in contrast to 'the one.'\n",
    "22. **Self-Determination as Distinct from 'The One'**: The element that appears distinct from 'the one' is actually its own self-determining process.\n",
    "23. **Reduction to Reference Point**: The unity of 'the one' with itself, when seen as distinct, becomes merely a reference point.\n",
    "24. **Negative Unity as Self-Negation**: The concept of negative unity, where 'the one' negates itself as an 'other.'\n",
    "25. **Exclusion within 'The One'**: A process of self-exclusion within 'the one', where it separates itself from its own otherness.\n",
    "26. **Complex Internal Dynamics**: The intricate internal dynamics within 'the one', characterized by both acknowledgment and negation of its own aspects.\n",

    "### Summary of Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The One as Embodiment of the Void**: 'The one' as the void, symbolizing the abstract nature of self-referential negation.\n",
    "2. **Dichotomy Between the One and the Void**: The contrast between the void, defined as nothingness, and 'the one', which also has an affirmative aspect of being.\n",
    "3. **Shared Reference and Resulting Diversity**: The diversity between 'the one' and the void comes from their mutual reference to 'the one'.\n",
    "4. **The Void as an External Existence**: Distinct from the affirmative being of 'the one', the void exists as a separate, external entity.\n",
    "5. **Existence of Being-for-Itself**: 'Being-for-itself', when understood as 'the one' and 'the void', gains a tangible existence.\n",
    "6. **The One and the Void as Cohesive Entities**: 'The one' and 'the void' are unified through their shared attribute of negative self-reference.\n",
    "7. **Negative Self-Reference as Common Ground**: The commonality between 'the one' and 'the void' is their negative self-reference.\n",
    "8. **Simplicity and Depth**: 'Being-for-itself' is both complex and profound in its existence as 'the one' and 'the void'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Concepts from Previous Section \"a. The one within\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inherent Existence of the One**: The existence of 'the one' is fundamental and does not depend on external factors or relationships.\n",
    "2. **Negation of Conventional Categories**: 'The one' defines itself by a process of negation, rejecting traditional categories and definitions.\n",
    "3. **Non-Relational Nature**: 'The one' is not defined by its relation to other entities or concepts.\n",
    "4. **Constancy and Unchangeability**: The unalterable nature of 'the one', emphasizing its permanence and resistance to change.\n",
    "5. **State of Indeterminate Existence**: The subject is undefined, yet distinct from mere existence.\n",
    "6. **Self-Referential Certainty**: The undefined state is a form of self-referential definiteness, an absolute and self-contained existence.\n",
    "7. **Negation as Self-Reference**: Its form of negation is a process of self-referral, creating an intrinsic distinction within itself.\n",
    "8. **Illusion of External Direction**: The subject appears to extend beyond itself but immediately retracts this extension, underscoring its self-contained nature.\n",
    "9. **Non-existence of an 'Other'**: In its self-determining process, the subject does not actually relate to anything external; there is no 'other' it is directed towards.\n",
    "10. **Dissolution of Mediation and Diversity**: In the state of 'the one', distinctions and complexities, including the separation between existence and ideality, vanish.\n",
    "11. **The One and the Absence of Anything**: Within 'the one', there is nothing – an absence or void, which is a form of self-referential abstraction.\n",
    "12. **Distinction Between Inherent Nature and Mediated State**: The difference between the inherent nature of 'the one' and its mediated state, which is more concrete or tangible.\n",
    "13. **Abstract vs. Concrete Nature of the One**: 'The one' is both abstractly identical to itself and concretely distinct in its mediated form.\n",
    "14. **The Void as a Defining Quality**: The acknowledged absence within 'the one' is the void, defining 'the one' in its immediate and unmediated state.\n",

The one, as referred to, contains the negative as reference; it has this reference, therefore, in it. Hence, instead of a becoming, the one's own immanent reference is, first, present; and, second, since this reference is negative and the one is at the same time an existent, the one repels itself from itself.

    "\n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Strictly speaking, however, this is not just a becoming; for becoming is a transition of being into nothing; the one, by contrast, becomes only a one. The one, as referred to, contains the negative as reference; it has this reference, therefore, in it. Hence, instead of a becoming, the one's own immanent reference is, first, present; and, second, since this reference is negative and the one is at the same time an existent, the one repels itself from itself. This negative reference of the one to itself is repulsion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distinction from Traditional Becoming**: The process involving 'the one' is different from the conventional understanding of becoming, which is a transition from being to nothingness.\n",
    "- **The One's Transformation**: 'The one' undergoes a transformation, but it remains a 'one', not transitioning into nothingness.\n",
    "- **Inherent Negation in The One**: Negation is an internal aspect of 'the one', not something external or separate.\n",
    "- **Continuous Presence and Self-Repulsion**: 'The one' is characterized by a constant presence and a form of self-repulsion due to its internal negation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. This repulsion, as thus the positing of many ones but through the one itself, is the one's own coming-forth-from-itself, but to such outside it as are themselves only ones. This is repulsion according to the concept, as it exists implicitly in itself. The second repulsion is distinguished from it. It is the one that first occurs to the representation of external reflection, not as the generation of ones but only as the mutual holding off of ones which are presupposed as already there. To be seen now is how the first repulsion that exists in itself determines itself as the second, the external repulsion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repulsion as Self-Emergence**: Repulsion is a process whereby 'the one' gives rise to many ones, signifying its self-projection.\n",
    "- **Inherent vs. External Repulsion**: The distinction between the inherent nature of repulsion within 'the one' and a second type of repulsion, which is observed externally.\n",
    "- **Conceptual vs. Observable Repulsion**: The difference between repulsion as a conceptual, internal process within 'the one', and repulsion as it appears to external observation.\n",
    "- **Transition from Intrinsic to External Repulsion**: How the internal, conceptual form of repulsion evolves into the external, observable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. We must first establish the determinations that the many ones have as such. The becoming of the many, or their being produced, immediately vanishes as the product of a positing; what is produced are the ones, not for another, but as infinitely referring to themselves. The one repels only itself from itself; it does not come to be but it already is; that which is represented as the repelled is equally a one, an existent; repelling and being repelled applies in like manner to both, and makes no difference.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining the Many Ones**: The inherent properties of the many ones must be established.\n",
    "- **Fleeting Nature of Production**: The process of becoming many, or production, is transient and vanishes almost immediately.\n",
    "- **Self-Referential Existence**: The ones are produced not for another purpose or entity but exist in a state of continuous self-reference.\n",
    "- **The One's Self-Repulsion**: 'The one' distances itself from itself, existing in a state of being rather than becoming.\n",
    "- **Equality in Repulsion**: What is repelled is also a 'one', and the act of repelling is identical for both entities involved, making no distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. The ones are thus presupposed with respect to each other posited through the repulsion of the one from itself; presupposed, posited as non-posited; their being-posited is sublated, they are existents with respect to each other, such as refer only to themselves.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutual Presupposition of the Ones**: The ones are presumed to exist in relation to each other, a relationship established through self-repulsion.\n",
    "- **Implicit Existence and Positing**: The ones' existence is assumed and their positing is as though it were not an active process.\n",
    "- **Negation of Being-Posited**: The state of being posited is negated or overturned, emphasizing their independent existence.\n",
    "- **Self-Referential Existence**: Each of the ones exists independently, with each referring only to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Thus plurality appears not as an otherness, but as a determination completely external to the one. The one, in repelling itself, remains reference to itself, just like that which is taken as repelled at the start. That the ones are other to one another, that they are brought together in the determinateness of plurality, does not therefore concern the one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plurality as External to The One**: Plurality is not an inherent otherness but a condition external to 'the one'.\n",
    "- **Self-Referential Nature in Repulsion**: 'The one', in the act of repelling itself, maintains its self-reference, similar to the initially repelled entity.\n",
    "- **Irrelevance of Plurality to The One**: The distinctness of the ones and their collective state as a plurality do not impact the essential nature of 'the one'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. If the plurality were a reference of the ones to one another, the ones would then limit each other and would have the being-for-other affirmatively in them. Their connecting reference (and this they have through their unity which is in itself), as posited here, is determined as none; it is again the previously posited void.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential Reference Among the Ones**: Contemplating the scenario where the concept of plurality is a result of the ones referring to each other.\n",
    "- **Limitation and Being-for-Other**: If the ones were in reference to each other, they would limit each other and possess an affirmative quality of being-for-other.\n",
    "- **Nature of Their Connection**: Their actual connection, which stems from their intrinsic unity, is determined here to be non-existent.\n",
    "- **Return to the Concept of the Void**: This absence of connection between the ones is akin to revisiting the concept of the void.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. This void is their limit, but an external limit in which they are not supposed to be for one another. The limit is that in which the limited are just as much as are not; but the void is determined as pure non-being, and this alone constitutes the limit of the ones.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Void as an External Limit**: The void serves as a limit for the ones, but it is an external, rather than an internal, constraint.\n",
    "- **Nature of Limits**: Limits usually represent a state where entities both exist and do not exist simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Unique Definition of the Void**: The void is defined as pure non-being, distinguishing it from other types of limits.\n",
    "- **The Void as the Sole Boundary**: Pure non-being constitutes the exclusive boundary for the ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. The repulsion of the one from itself is the making explicit of what the one is implicitly in itself; but, thus laid out as one-outside-the-other, infinity is here an infinity that has externalized itself, and this it has done through the immediacy of the infinite, of the one. Infinity is just as much the simple reference of the one to the one as, on the contrary, the one's absolute lack of reference; it is the former according to the simple affirmative reference of the one to itself; it is the latter according to the same reference as negative.**\n",

    "- **Dual Nature of Infinity**: Infinity represents both the direct self-reference of 'the one' and its complete lack of reference.\n",
    "- **Affirmative vs. Negative Reference**: Infinity is affirmative when considering 'the one’s' simple self-reference and becomes negative when this reference is seen as a negation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Or again, the plurality of the ones is the one's own positing of the one; the one is nothing but the negative reference of the one to itself, and this reference [hence the one itself] is the plural one. But equally, plurality is utterly external to the one, for the one is precisely the sublating of otherness; repulsion is its self-reference and simple equality with itself. The plurality of the ones is infinity as a contradiction that unconstrainedly produces itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plurality as Self-Creation**: The plurality of the ones is 'the one' engaging in the act of self-creation.\n",

    "**Segment 1:**\n",
    "\"The many ones are each a being; their existence or their reference to one another is a non-reference, it is external to them: the abstract void. But they themselves are now this negative reference to themselves as to existent others: the demonstrated contradiction, the infinity posited in the immediacy of being. With this, repulsion now finds immediately before it that which is repelled by it. In this determination, it is an excluding; the one repels from itself only the many not generated by it, the ones not posited by it. This repelling is mutual or from all sides, relative, limited by the being of the ones.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 2:**\n",
    "\"Plurality is not at first posited otherness; limit is only the void, only that in which the ones are not. But in the limit they also are; they are in the void, or their repulsion is their common connecting reference.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 3:**\n",
    "\"This mutual repulsion is the posited existence of the many ones; it is not their being-for-itself, in accordance with which they would be distinguished as many only in a third, but is rather their own distinguishing which preserves them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 4:**\n",
    "\"They mutually negate themselves, posit one another as being only for-one. But at the same time they negate this being only for-one just as much; they repel the ideality that they have and are. So the moments which in ideality are absolutely united come apart.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 5:**\n",
    "\"In its being-for-itself, the one is also for-one; but this one, for which it is, is itself; its distinguishing from itself is immediately sublated. But in the plurality the distinguished one has a being; the being-for-one as has been determined in exclusion is therefore a being-for-other. Each thus comes to be repelled by an other, is sublated and made into a one which is not for itself but for-one, and an other one at that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 6:**\n",
    "\"The being-for-itself of the many ones thus shows itself to be their self-preservation through the mediation of their mutual repulsion in which they sublated themselves reciprocally and posit the others as mere being-for-another. But the self-preservation consists at the same time in repelling this ideality and positing the ones as not being for-an-other. This self-preservation of the ones through their negative reference to one another is, however, rather their dissolution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 7:**\n",
    "\"The ones not only are but maintain themselves through their reciprocal exclusion. First, it is in their being, and indeed their being-in-itself as contrasted with their reference to the other, that they should now have a firm point of support for their diversity as against their being negated; this in-itselfness rests on their being ones. But they all are this; in their being-in-itself, instead of having there their firm point of support for their diversity, they are all the same.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 8:**\n",
    "\"Second, their existence and their way of relating to one another, that is, their positing themselves as one, is their reciprocal negating; this, however, is likewise one and the same determination of all through which they therefore posit themselves as identical; just as, by being in themselves the same, the ideality that should be posited in them through others is their own, and they thus repel just as little. According to their being and positing, they are, consequently, only one affirmative unity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 9:**\n",
    "\"This consideration regarding the ones: that from either side of their determination, whether they just are or refer to one another, they show themselves to be only one and the same, indistinguishable, is a comparison that belongs to us. Also to be seen, therefore, is what is posited in them in their mutual reference itself.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 10:**\n",
    "\"They are (this much is presupposed in this reference) and they are only inasmuch as they negate themselves reciprocally and at the same time keep away this ideality, their being negated, from themselves, that is, they negate the reciprocal negating.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 11:**\n",
    "\"But they are only inasmuch as they negate, and so, since their reciprocal negating is negated, their being is negated. To be sure, since they are, nothing would be negated through this negating which for them is only something external; this negating of the other rebounds off them, coming their way only by striking their surface.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 12:**\n",
    "\"And yet, they turn back upon themselves only by negating the others; they are only as this mediation, this turning back of theirs is their self-preservation and their being-for-itself. Since their negating is ineffectual because of the resistance offered by the others, whether as existents or as negating, they do not return back to themselves, do not preserve themselves, and so are not.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 13:**\n",
    "\"It was previously remarked that the ones themselves are each a one like any other. This is not just a matter of our connecting them by way of reference, of bringing them together externally; repulsion is itself a referring; the one that excludes the ones refers itself to them, to the ones, that is, to itself.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Repulsion as Fragmentation**: Repulsion causes 'the one' to fragment into many entities, each negatively interconnected with the others.\n",
    "2. **Presupposition of Existence**: Each of the many presupposes the existence of the others.\n",
    "3. **Ideality as Potential**: This state represents the potential or the 'ought' of ideality, suggesting an unrealized state.\n",
    "4. **Realization through Attraction**: This ideality, which is merely potential in the state of repulsion, is expected to be actualized in the process of attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 2**:\n",
    "\"Repulsion passes over into attraction, the many ones into one one. Both, repulsion and attraction, are at first distinguished from each other, repulsion as the reality of the ones, attraction as their posited ideality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transition from Repulsion to Attraction**: Repulsion naturally progresses into attraction.\n",
    "2. **Convergence of Many to One**: The transformation process where multiple entities (the many ones) merge into a single entity (one one).\n",
    "3. **Initial Distinction Between Forces**: Repulsion is the reality of the individual entities, and attraction is their potential or ideality.\n",
    "4. **Contrast Between Reality and Ideality**: The actual state of the ones (repulsion) and their idealized state (attraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 3**:\n",
    "\"Attraction refers to repulsion by having it for a presupposition. Repulsion delivers the material for attraction. If there were no ones, there would be nothing to attract; the representation of continuing attraction, of the consumption of the ones, presupposes an equally continuing generation of the ones; the sense representation of spatial attraction gives continuity to the flow of ones to be attracted; to replace the atoms that vanish at the point of attraction, another multitude comes forth from the void, infinitely if one so wishes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependence of Attraction on Repulsion**: Attraction relies on repulsion, as it requires the existence of the ones generated by repulsion.\n",
    "2. **Continuous Generation and Consumption**: A continuous cycle where the ones are both consumed by attraction and regenerated.\n",
    "3. **Spatial Representation of Attraction**: The common understanding of spatial attraction implies a continual flow of the ones towards a point of attraction.\n",
    "4. **Renewal from the Void**: As some ones are absorbed in the process of attraction, new ones continuously emerge from the void, creating an infinite cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 4**:\n",
    "\"If attraction were represented as accomplished, that is, the many as brought to the point of the one one, the result would be just an inert one, no longer any attraction. The ideality immediately present in attraction still also has in it the determination of the negation of itself, the many ones to which it refers; attraction is inseparable from repulsion.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothetical Completion of Attraction**: The idea of attraction being completed, resulting in the many becoming one unified entity.\n",
    "2. **Result of Completed Attraction**: If attraction were fully realized, it would lead to a static or inert state, where no further attraction occurs.\n",
    "3. **Ideality and Its Negation in Attraction**: Even within the concept of attraction, there is an inherent negation, which relates to the many ones that attraction initially sought to unify.\n",
    "4. **Inseparability of Attraction and Repulsion**: The fundamental interconnectedness of attraction and repulsion within this conceptual framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segment 5**:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Absence of Precedence**: No single entity among the ones has any inherent advantage or precedence over another.\n",
    "2. **Implication of Distinct Differences**: The notion of precedence would necessitate a clear, defined distinction between the entities, which is not present.\n",
    "3. **Role of Attraction in Affirming Indistinguishability**: Attraction's primary function is to establish the lack of distinct differences among the ones, highlighting their indistinguishability.\n",
    "\n",

    "\"Attraction is itself the positing in the first place of a one distinct from other ones; these are only the immediate ones that are to preserve themselves through repulsion; through their posited negation, however, what proceeds is the one of attraction which is therefore determined as the mediated one, the one posited as one. The first ones, as immediate, do not in their ideality return into themselves, but have this ideality each in another.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Impact on Immediate Ones**: Attraction impacts the immediate ones, which try to preserve themselves through repulsion.\n",
    "3. **Emergence of Mediated One**: The distinct 'one' emerges through the negation imposed by attraction, resulting in a 'one' that is mediated or deliberately posited.\n",

    "1. **Text Segment:**\n",
    "    \"This unity is, therefore, (a) being, only as affirmative, that is, immediacy self-mediated through the negation of negation: being is posited as a unity permeating its determinacies, limits, etc., which are posited in it as sublated; (b) existence: in this determination it is negation or determinateness as moment of the affirmative being; yet this determinateness is no longer immediate but reflected into itself, refers not to another but to itself; (c) absolutely-determined-being, (d) absolute in-itselfness, (e) the one; (f) otherness as such is itself being-for-itself; (g) being-for-itself: as that being which persists across the determinateness and in which the one and even the being-determined-in-itself are posited as sublated.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Being as Affirmative**: The transcreation explains that being is an affirmed entity, self-mediated through the negation of negation.\n",
    "2. **Existence and Determinateness**: It highlights that in this unity, existence is negation within affirmative being, but this negation is self-reflected and inward-looking.\n",
    "3. **Absolutely-Determined-Being and In-Itselfness**: The passage points out the state of being absolutely determined and the concept of absolute in-itselfness, indicating a pure state of being.\n",
    "4. **The One and Otherness**: It describes the one as a singular entity and otherness as a form of being-for-itself.\n",
    "5. **Being-for-Itself as Persistence**: It concludes that being-for-itself is the persistence of being amidst determinateness, with the one and being-determined-in-itself being integrated within it.\n",

    "### Complete Analysis and Schema for C. REPULSION AND ATTRACTION: c. The Connection of Repulsion and Attraction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete Text Segment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The difference of the one and the many has determined itself as a difference of their mutual reference connecting them which breaks down into two, repulsion and attraction, each of which stands at first outside the other on its own, in such a way that the two are essentially joined together nevertheless. Their still indeterminate unity must be brought out in greater detail.**\n",
    "    - **Distinction Between One and Many**: The evolving distinction between the one and the many.\n",
    "    - **Mutual Interaction Leading to Dual Forces**: Their mutual interaction manifests as repulsion and attraction.\n",
    "    - **Initial Independence Yet Fundamental Connection**: Repulsion and attraction initially seem independent, but they are intrinsically connected.\n",
    "    - **Need for Detailed Exploration of Unity**: Further detailed examination is warranted to understand the unity between repulsion and attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **As the fundamental determination of the one, repulsion appears first, and it appears as immediate, like its ones which are indeed generated by it and yet are at the same time posited as immediate, and it is therefore indifferent to the attraction which is added to it externally as thus presupposed.**\n",
    "    - **Primacy of Repulsion**: Repulsion is the primary and initial characteristic of the one.\n",
    "    - **Immediate Manifestation**: Repulsion and the ones it creates appear spontaneously.\n",
    "    - **Indifference to Attraction**: Repulsion appears indifferent to attraction, which seems external.\n",
    "    - **External Presupposition of Attraction**: Attraction is seen as something presupposed externally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rather, attraction is not presupposed by repulsion: it is not supposed to have any part in the positing and in the being of the latter, that is, as if repulsion were not, already in it, the negation of itself, or the ones were not already negated in it. In this way, we have repulsion in abstraction, by itself, and attraction likewise holds out to the ones, as each an existent, the side of an immediate existence which comes to them by itself as an other.**\n",
    "    - **Independence of Attraction from Repulsion**: Attraction is not a presupposition or contributing factor in repulsion.\n",
    "    - **Repulsion and Negation**: Repulsion is not inherently self-negating.\n",
    "    - **Abstraction of Repulsion**: Repulsion is considered abstractly and separately.\n",
    "    - **Attraction as an External Element**: Attraction offers immediate existence to the ones as an external factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **If we take mere repulsion in this way, for itself, it is then the dispersion of the many ones in indeterminacy, outside the sphere of repulsion itself; for repulsion is the negating of the connection of the many to one another; lack of connection is their determination when abstractly taken. But repulsion is not just the void; the ones, although unconnected, do not repel what constitutes their determination, do not exclude it.**\n",
    "    - **Repulsion as Dispersion**: Isolated repulsion leads to the dispersion of the many ones into indeterminacy.\n",
    "    - **Negation of Connection**: Repulsion negates the interconnectedness of the many ones.\n",
    "    - **Distinction from the Void**: Repulsion, considered independently, is different from the void.\n",
    "    - **Non-Exclusion of Determination**: The ones do not repel or exclude their defining aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Although negative, repulsion is nonetheless essentially connection; the mutual repulsion and flight is not a liberation from what is repelled and fled from; that which is excluded still stands in connection with what is excluded from it. But this moment of connection is attraction, which is thus within repulsion itself; it is the negating of that abstract repulsion by which the ones would each be an existent referring only to itself without mutual exclusion.**\n",
    "    - **Repulsion as Connection**: Repulsion fundamentally constitutes a form of connection.\n",
    "    - **Continued Connection in Repulsion**: Entities involved in repulsion remain connected to what they repel.\n",
    "    - **Role of Attraction within Repulsion**: Attraction exists within the framework of repulsion as a moment of connection.\n",
    "    - **Negation of Abstract Repulsion**: Attraction negates the abstract concept of repulsion, preventing isolated self-reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **But in starting with the repulsion of the ones as immediately present there, and with attraction consequently also posited as intruding on them externally, the two, repulsion and attraction, are held apart as diverse determinations despite their inseparability. But it has been established that it is not just repulsion which is presupposed by attraction, but that there equally is present also a reverse connection of repulsion to attraction, and that repulsion no less has attraction for its presupposition.**\n",
    "    - **Initial Distinction of Repulsion and Attraction**: Repulsion and attraction initially seem distinct.\n",
    "    - **Inherent Inseparability**: Despite initial appearance, they are inseparable.\n",
    "    - **Mutual Dependency and Presupposition**: Attraction presupposes repulsion and vice versa.\n",
    "    - **Reciprocal Relationship**: Both forces are foundational to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **As thus determined, they are inseparable, and at the same time each is determined as an ought and a limitation with respect to the other. Their ought is their abstract determinateness as each an existent in itself, a determinateness, however, which is thereby directed beyond itself and refers to the other. And so, through the mediation of the other, each is as other; their self-subsistence consists in their being mutually posited in this mediation as an other determining.**\n",
    "    - **Inseparability and Mutual Definition**: The ones are inseparable and mutually define each other.\n",
    "    - **Ought and Limitation**: Each one carries an obligation (an 'ought') and a limitation with respect to the other.\n",
    "    - **Abstract Nature and Reference to the Other**: Their abstract nature inherently refers to and depends on the other.\n",
    "    - **Interdependence in Mediation**: Each one is defined by the other through mutual interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Thus, repulsion is the positing of the many; attraction the positing of the one; this latter is equally the negation of the many and the former the negation of the ideality of such a many in the one; so that attraction too is attraction only through the mediation of repulsion, just as repulsion is repulsion through the mediation of attraction.**\n",
    "    - **Role of Repulsion and Attraction**: Repulsion creates the many, whereas attraction creates the one.\n",
    "    - **Negation by Attraction and Repulsion**: Attraction negates the many to establish the one, while repulsion negates the ideality of these many.\n",
    "    - **Interdependence of Forces**: Both attraction and repulsion are defined through their interplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **In all this, however, the mediation of each with itself through the other is in fact negated; each of the two determinations is its own self-mediation. This will result from a closer examination of the two determinations and will bring us back to the unity of their concept.**\n",
    "    - **Negation of Mutual Mediation**: The mutual mediation of repulsion and attraction is negated.\n",
    "    - **Self-Mediation of Forces**: Both repulsion and attraction engage in self-mediation, functioning independently.\n",
    "    - **Further Examination Leading to Unity**: A deeper exploration will reveal their nature of self-mediation and lead to an understanding of their unified concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **In the first place, that each presupposes itself, that in its presupposition each refers only to itself, this is already present in the way the still relative repulsion and attraction behave at first.**\n",
    "    - **Self-Presupposition of Forces**: Both repulsion and attraction presuppose themselves independently.\n",
    "    - **Self-Referential Nature**: This self-focus or self-reference is inherent in the way these forces initially operate.\n",
    "    - **Relative Independence in Initial Behavior**: The initial behavior of repulsion and attraction demonstrates their relative independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Relative repulsion is the mutual repulsion of many ones which are already at hand, supposedly immediately given. But that there be many ones, this is repulsion itself; any presupposition that it would have is only its own positing. Moreover, the determination of the being that would accrue to the ones apart from their being posited (whereby they would already be) belongs likewise to repulsion.**\n",
    "    - **Concept of Relative Repulsion**: Relative repulsion is the mutual repulsion among already present multiple entities.\n",
    "    - **Foundation in Repulsion**: The existence of the many ones is a result of repulsion itself.\n",
    "    - **Repulsion as Self-Positing**: Any presupposition regarding the existence of the many ones is a manifestation of repulsion's act of creation.\n",
    "    - **Attribution of Being to Repulsion**: Any inherent characteristics assigned to the ones, as if they existed apart from repulsion, are fundamentally linked to repulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Repelling is that through which the ones manifest themselves and maintain themselves as ones; through which they are as such. Their being is their repulsion itself, which is thus not some relative existence against another other but relates itself throughout only to itself.**\n",
    "    - **Repulsion as Manifestation and Maintenance**: Repulsion is fundamental for the ones to manifest and maintain their existence.\n",
    "    - **Definition of Being through Repulsion**: The essence of their being is directly linked to their act of repulsion.\n",
    "    - **Self-Referential Nature of Repulsion**: Repulsion is not just a relative existence in contrast to another entity\n",
    "\n",
    ", but a self-referential process.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Attraction is the positing of the one as such, of the real one, with respect to which the existence of the many is determined as only a vanishing idealization. Attraction thus directly presupposes itself; it presupposes itself in the determination namely, of the many ones to be an idealization, the same ones which are otherwise supposed to have existence for themselves and to repel others, including therefore any other that attracts. Against this determination of repulsion, the ones do not attain ideality only through the relation to attraction; on the contrary, the ideality is presupposed: it is the ideality of the ones as an existent in itself, inasmuch as they, as ones (including the one conceived as attracting), are not distinguished from one another but are one and the same.**\n",
    "    - **Attraction Establishing the One**: Attraction establishes the one as a real entity, making the existence of the many appear as ephemeral idealizations.\n",
    "    - **Self-Presupposition of Attraction**: Attraction presupposes its own existence, particularly in viewing the many ones as idealizations.\n",
    "    - **Ideality of the Ones**: The ideality of the ones is not solely derived from their relation to attraction but is an inherent assumption.\n",
    "    - **Unity and Indistinguishability of the Ones**: The ones, including the attractor, are essentially undifferentiated, forming a collective unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **This self-presupposing of the two determinations, each for itself, implies further that each contains within itself the other as moment. Self-presupposing in general is the positing of oneself in a one as the negative of oneself (repulsion), and what is presupposed in this positing is the same as that which presupposes (attraction). That each is in itself only a moment, this is the transition of each from itself into the other, the negation of itself in the other and the positing of itself as the other of itself.**\n",
    "    - **Self-Presupposition of Forces**: Both repulsion and attraction presuppose themselves independently.\n",
    "    - **Inclusion of the Other as a Component**: In this self-presupposition, each force inherently includes the other.\n",
    "    - **Nature of Self-Presupposing**: Self-presupposing involves creating a state of being that is the negation of oneself, as seen in repulsion, with attraction being the force that is presupposed.\n",
    "    - **Interrelation and Transition**: Each force, being just a moment within the other, transitions into the other, negating itself and establishing itself as the counterpart of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **The one, as such, is thus a coming-out-of-itself; is itself only the positing of itself as its other, as the many. And the many, for its part, is only the falling back upon itself and the positing of itself as its other, as a one, and is in this equally only the connecting of itself to itself, each continuing itself in its other.**\n",
    "    - **Self-Expansion of the One**: The one manifests itself by expanding into its opposite, the many.\n",
    "    - **Convergence of the Many**: The many, in turn, comes back upon itself, establishing itself as a singular entity, or 'the one'.\n",
    "    - **Cycle of Self-Positing and Connection**: A continuous cycle where both 'the one' and 'the many' connect with themselves through their opposites, perpetuating each other's existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Therefore, the coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and the self-positing-as-one (attraction) are already inherently present as undivided. But in the repulsion and attraction which are relative, that is, which presuppose immediate, determinedly existent ones, it is posited that the two are each, within it, this negation of itself, and consequently also the continuity of itself in its other.**\n",
    "    - **Inherent Unity of Repulsion and Attraction**: Repulsion and attraction are inherently undivided in their fundamental forms.\n",
    "    - **Relative Nature of Forces**: In their relative forms, where repulsion and attraction presuppose the existence of distinct entities, a different dynamic is observed.\n",
    "    - **Self-Negation and Continuation**: In these relative forms, both repulsion and attraction negate themselves and perpetuate their existence through their opposites.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **The repulsion of the determinedly existent ones is the self-preservation of the one through the mutual holding off of the others, so that (1) the other ones are negated in it (this is the side of its existence or of its being-for-another and is therefore attraction as the ideality of the ones); and (2) the one is in itself, without reference to the others (however, not only has the in-itself in general long since passed over into being-for-itself; the one in itself, according to its determination, is the coming to be of many).**\n",
    "    - **Repulsion as Self-Preservation**: Repulsion among distinct entities serves as a means of self-preservation for the one.\n",
    "    - **Negation and Existence**: This process includes the negation of other ones (viewed as attraction in its ideality) and the independent existence of the one itself.\n",
    "    - **Transition from In-Itself to Being-For-Itself**: The state of being 'in itself' for the one has evolved into a state of being-for-itself.\n",
    "    - **Emergence of Many from the One**: The inherent definition of the one in itself suggests the eventual emergence of many.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **The attraction of the existent ones is their ideality and the positing of the one, and in this, as both the negating and the producing of the one, attraction sublates itself, and as a positing within it of the one, is the negative of itself: it is repulsion.**\n",
    "    - **Attraction as Ideality and Formation of the One**: Attraction serves as the ideality among existing entities and their process of forming the one.\n",
    "    - **Dual Role of Attraction**: Attraction has a dual function: negating and producing the one.\n",
    "    - **Self-Negation of Attraction**: Through these roles, attraction negates itself, leading to a transformation.\n",
    "    - **Transformation into Repulsion**: In positing the one, attraction becomes the opposite of itself, essentially turning into repulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **With this, the development of being-for-itself is completed and has attained its result. In connecting itself to itself infinitely, that is, as the posited negation of negation, the one is the mediation by which it repels itself as its absolute (that is, abstract) otherness (the many) from itself, and in thus negatively connecting itself to this, its non-being, it sublates it and is in it precisely only the connection to itself.**\n",
    "    - **Completion of Being-For-Itself Development**: The development of being-for-itself is now complete.\n",
    "    - **Infinite Self-Connection**: This completion involves an infinite process of self-connection, characterized as negating the negation.\n",
    "    - **Mediation and Self-Repulsion**: The one mediates this process by repelling its absolute otherness, the many.\n",
    "    - **Negation of Otherness**: Through this repulsion and interaction with its non-being, the one negates its otherness.\n",
    "    - **Realization of Self-Connection**: This entire process leads to the one’s realization of its connection solely with itself.\n",

    "20. **The one is only this becoming in which the determination “it begins,” that is, its being posited as an immediate existent, and equally that, as result, it has restored itself as the one, that is, the equally immediate and exclusive one, have vanished; the process which it is, posits and contains it from all sides only as something sublated.**\n",
    "    - **Dynamic Process of Becoming**: The one is not a static entity but a continuous process of becoming.\n",
    "    - **Negation of Immediate Existence**: The one's initial state as an immediate existent is negated in this process.\n",
    "    - **Restoration and Exclusivity Negated**: Even the outcome of the one, as a restored and exclusive entity, is also negated.\n",
    "    - **Continuous Sublation**: The one is consistently positioned and redefined as something that is constantly being transcended or sublated.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **The sublation, determined at first only as a relative sublating of the connection to another existent, a connection which is therefore itself not an indifferent repulsion and attraction, equally proves itself to pass over into the infinite connection of mediation through the negation of the external connection of immediate and determinate existents, and to have for result precisely that becoming which, in the instability of its moments, is the collapse, or rather the going-together-with-itself, into simple immediacy. This being, according to the determination which it has now acquired, is quantity.**\n",
    "    - **Initial Concept of Sublation**: Sublation is initially a relative negation of a connection to another entity.\n",
    "    - **Evolution into Infinite Connection**: Sublation transitions into an infinite connection through mediation.\n",
    "    - **Negation of External Links**: The negation of external connections among immediate and determinate existents.\n",
    "    - **Resulting Unification and Immediacy**: This process leads to a unification or collapse, resulting in a state of simple immediacy.\n",
    "    - **Emergence of Quantity**: This state of being, with its new characteristics, constitutes what is known as quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **If we briefly review the moments of this transition of quality into quantity, we find that the qualitative has\n",
    "\n",
    " being and immediacy for its fundamental determination, and the limit and the determinateness are in this immediacy so identical with the being of something, that the something itself vanishes along with its alteration; as thus posited, it is determined as finite.**\n",
    "    - **Fundamental Determination of the Qualitative**: The qualitative aspect is fundamentally determined by its being and immediacy.\n",
    "    - **Identity with Limit and Determinateness**: Limits and specific characteristics of something are deeply intertwined with its very existence.\n",
    "    - **Vanishing with Alteration**: The entity itself ceases to exist as it undergoes change, given its intrinsic link with its characteristics.\n",
    "    - **Determination as Finite**: This state of being, where change leads to the disappearance of the entity, defines it as finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Because of the immediacy of this unity in which the distinction has disappeared, although it is implicitly present in the unity of being and nothing, the distinction falls outside that unity as otherness in general.**\n",
    "    - **Immediate Nature of Unity**: The immediate and undifferentiated nature of the unity being discussed.\n",
    "    - **Implicit Presence of Distinction**: Despite the apparent absence of distinctions in this unity, they are implicitly present within the combined concept of being and nothing.\n",
    "    - **Emergence of Otherness**: These distinctions manifest themselves as a form of otherness, which is external to the unified state.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **This reference to the other contradicts the immediacy in which qualitative determinateness is self-reference. This otherness is sublated in the infinity of the being-for-itself, the being-for-itself that has realized the distinction implicitly present in it in the negation of negation: has realized it as the one and the many and as their connecting references, and has also elevated the qualitative to true unity, that is, a unity which is no longer immediate but posited as accordant with itself.**\n",
    "    - **Contradiction Between Otherness and Immediacy**: The contradiction between the concept of otherness and the immediate self-reference of qualitative determinateness.\n",
    "    - **Resolution in Being-for-Itself**: This contradiction is resolved in the concept of being-for-itself, which represents an infinite nature.\n",
    "    - **Actualization of Implicit Distinction**: Being-for-itself realizes the implicit distinction within itself through the negation of negation, manifesting as both the one and the many.\n",
    "    - **Elevation to True Unity**: This process elevates the qualitative nature to a true unity, which is consciously self-harmonious, moving beyond mere immediacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **This unity is, therefore, (a) being, only as affirmative, that is, immediacy self-mediated through the negation of negation: being is posited as a unity permeating its determinacies, limits, etc., which are posited in it as sublated; (b) existence: in this determination it is negation or determinateness as moment of the affirmative being; yet this determinateness is no longer immediate but reflected into itself, refers not to another but to itself; (c) absolutely-determined-being, (d) absolute in-itselfness, (e) the one; (f) otherness as such is itself being-for-itself; (g) being-for-itself: as that being which persists across the determinateness and in which the one and even the being-determined-in-itself are posited as sublated.**\n",
    "    - **Being as Affirmative**: Being is an affirmed entity, self-mediated through the negation of negation.\n",
    "    - **Existence and Determinateness**: Existence is negation within affirmative being, but this negation is self-reflected and inward-looking.\n",
    "    - **Absolutely-Determined-Being and In-Itselfness**: The state of being absolutely determined and the concept of absolute in-itselfness.\n",
    "    - **The One and Otherness**: The one as a singular entity and otherness as a form of being-for-itself.\n",
    "    - **Being-for-Itself as Persistence**: Being-for-itself is the persistence of being amidst determinateness, with the one and being-determined-in-itself being integrated within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **The one is simultaneously determined as having gone beyond itself and as unity; the one, the absolutely determined limit, is consequently posited as a limit which is none, a limit which is in being but is indifferent to it.**\n",
    "    - **Dual Nature of the One**: The one both transcends itself and retains its unity.\n",
    "    - **Paradoxical Limit**: The one is an absolute limit, yet it is conceptualized as a non-limit.\n",
    "    - **Indifference to Being**: The one exists within the realm of being but does not engage with or is indifferent to this state.\n",
