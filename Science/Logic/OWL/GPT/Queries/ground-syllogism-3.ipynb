    "You are correct. Let's focus on completing the final analysis and OWL schema for the third figure: S-U-P.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Analysis and Schema for the Third Syllogistic Figure (S-U-P)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Interconnectedness and Completion:**\n",
    "   - **Reciprocal Presupposition:**\n",
    "     - The third figure, S-U-P, presupposes the first (S-P-U) and second (P-S-U) figures, and is also presupposed by them. This reflects a mutual dependence among the syllogistic figures.\n",
    "     - Each syllogism, while being a mediation on its own, relies on an immediacy whose mediation lies outside itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Truth of the Formal Syllogism:**\n",
    "   - **Abstract Universality:**\n",
    "     - The middle term, U (Universality), represents the abstract universal, where the extremes S (Singularity) and P (Particularity) are not contained according to their essential determinateness but only their universality.\n",
    "     - The formalism of the syllogism is exposed, showing that terms have an immediate content indifferent to the form, indicating they haven't reflected into determinations of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Indeterminate Universal:**\n",
    "   - **Indifference of Extremes:**\n",
    "     - The unity of the extremes in the middle term is one where their specific determinateness is abstracted away, leading to an indeterminate universal.\n",
    "     - The universal, as the middle term, is distinct from the extremes, thus becoming a determinate in contrast to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Role of the Middle Term:**\n",
    "   - **Universal as Predicate:**\n",
    "     - The universal middle term subsumes both extremes, acting as the predicate rather than the subject.\n",
    "     - This structure reflects a relational indifference, where the distinction between major and minor premises becomes irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Objective Significance and Contingency:**\n",
    "   - **Abstract Universality and External Mediation:**\n",
    "     - The universal as the middle term highlights the contingency of the syllogistic inference, indicating that the extremes’ conjunction in the conclusion must rely on an external mediation.\n",
    "     - This leads to the formation of the fourth figure (U-U-U), characterized by a relationless syllogism, where qualitative differentiation of terms is abstracted, leading to an external unity or equality.\n",
